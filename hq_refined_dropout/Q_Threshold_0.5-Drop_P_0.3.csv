The redesign allows you to quickly swipe between different feeds just like you can on X. The change is rolling out on Android on Wednesday, and will launch on iOS in the coming days. ""Following is now just a swipe away, and you can easily swipe between any of your custom feeds,"" Mosseri said in the announcement. ""This may look like a small change, but it should make navigating the app much simpler."" The latest feature builds on updates that Threads has rolled out over the past two weeks. A few days ago, the social network began testing the option for users to choose their For You, Following, or a custom feed as default. The test was a long time coming, as users requested the option to set their Following feed as default since Threads' launch last year. In addition, Threads rolled out custom feeds last week to allow people to curate feeds around specific topics or certain user profiles. It will also now surface more content from people you follow in the app’s “For You” algorithmic feed in response to complaints from users who wanted to see less content from people they don't follow. Threads is also working on a feature that's similar to Bluesky’s “Starter Packs,” which are curated lists of recommended users for people to follow when they first join the app. All of these changes come as Meta is increasingly seeing Bluesky, a decentralized X competitor, as a serious threat. Meta has been moving quickly to update Threads at a time when many X users are moving to Bluesky, which has recently surpassed 20 million users. The social network has been working to appease users and is responding to their feedback in an effort to keep them from moving to Bluesky, which is catching up with Threads when it comes to daily active users.

There are too many duplicative regulatory agencies,” the Tesla CEO posted on his social media platform X a little after midnight Wednesday. The comment followed an appearance by celebrity venture capitalist and fellow Trump supporter Marc Andreessen on the Joe Rogan podcast, in which he accused the agency of attempting to “terrorize financial institutions” and “prevent new startups that want to compete with the big banks.” Under current Director Rohit Chopra, the CFPB has sued and fined a number of financial tech firms and other startups it accused of deceiving customers, including at least one backed by Andreesen’s own firm. In 2021, the regulator shut down the online payday lender LendUp “for repeatedly lying and illegally cheating its customers.” The press release announcing the move specifically noted that the company was backed by “some of the biggest names in venture capital, including Andreessen Horowitz, Kleiner Perkins, and Google Ventures. In his Rogan appearance, Andreessen also appeared to accuse the CFPB of conspiring to “debank” startup founders in disfavored industries such as crypto, by pressuring financial institutions to drop them as customers. The comments echoed claims about federal regulators such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation that have circulated among crypto industry executives and conservatives, including lawmakers on Capitol Hill. “It’s a privatized sanctions regime that lets bureaucrats do to American citizens the same thing that we do to Iran — just kick you out of the financial system,” Andreessen said. “This has been happening to all the crypto entrepreneurs over the last four years, this has been happening to the fintech entrepreneurs, anybody trying to start any kind of new banking service, because they’re trying to protect the big banks.” The CFPB, however, has recently taken legal and public stands against debanking — the forced closure of a bank account of an organization deemed to be a legal or financial threat. In an August appeals court argument, for instance, the agency warned that a federal judge’s decision in Texas limiting its ability to police discrimination by financial institutions would block it from investigating banks for cutting off conservative Christian groups. President-elect Donald Trump tapped Musk and former GOP candidate Vivek Ramaswamy to lead the so-called Department of Government Efficiency — or DOGE — a private advisory board tasked with finding trillions in budget savings. Both Ramaswamy and Musk have promised to thin out the federal workforce and trim the ranks of regulators, moves some critics have noted could benefit Musk’s own companies by easing oversight. X, for instance, has been seeking state money transmitter licenses that would allow it to operate as a payments app — a line of business that would put it under the purview of the CFPB. Mick Mulvaney, who served as head of the CFPB under Trump’s previous administration, told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday that he agreed with Musk that the agency should be eliminated because it simply created a “duplicative layer of additional regulatory oversight.” “To the extent we're trying to bring efficiencies to the system — either letting the CFPB do what it was supposed to do and take that authority away from others, which is never going to happen or shutting the CFPB — I'm all in for shutting the CFPB,” he said.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tpg-angelo-gordon-spies-2-192355096.html,"Wed, Nov 27, 2024, 11:23 AM","(Bloomberg) -- Americans borrowing against their homes after a surge in real estate prices are creating a $2 trillion opportunity for investors, according to TPG Angelo Gordon. Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Italy’s Motor City, Car-Free Options Are Growing In Traffic-Weary Toronto, a Battle Breaks Out Over Bike Lanes In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field “We’re seeing the evolution of home equity products,” TJ Durkin, the firm’s head of structured credit and specialty finance, said in the latest Bloomberg Intelligence Credit Edge podcast. “There could be $150 to $200 billion of origination per year, with a $2 trillion really addressable market there.” Consumers have seen the value of their residences surge since the pandemic. But rates have risen steeply since 2022, making it less attractive for US homeowners to pull out equity by refinancing existing low-rate mortgages with even bigger loans, known as a cash-out refinancing. That’s boosted demand for home equity products such as lines of credit and second lien debt, Durkin said. Those new, smaller loans can allow borrowers to tap into home equity without losing existing mortgages. Click here to listen to the full interview with TPG Angelo Gordon’s Durkin Home equity line of credit balances rose by $7 billion during the third quarter, according to Federal Reserve Bank of New York data. That’s the tenth consecutive quarterly increase, to about $387 billion in outstanding HELOCs. “We think the credit is pristine at this point,” said Durkin. “That’s a space where we’re looking to get deployed quickly,” he added, noting the potential for credit standards to loosen as more investors jump in. One of TPG Angelo Gordon’s focuses is structured products — including collateralized loan obligations and commercial real estate — and asset-based debt, both in public and private markets. It had about $88 billion of assets under management as of September, according to its website. The firm also sees value in commercial mortgage-backed bonds, despite pockets of stress. Durkin says a key risk to be cognizant of for CMBS is how long it will take to get repaid, as borrowers can often extend underlying loans for multiple years before refinancing. “That’s where we spent a lot of time the last couple of years and it’s been a fertile hunting ground for discounted but performing securities,” Durkin said, referring to CMBS. “Coming in with fresh capital, an opportunistic lens, I think that’s the most interesting space that we’re seeing in the public markets.” CMBS without agency backing have experienced a sort of comeback recently, with sales running about 160% higher than at this time last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Still, some bonds trade at a steep discount, especially those tied to a single building or borrower. TPG Angelo Gordon is also looking to ride the asset-based finance wave, where private credit funds extend debt against streams of contractual cash flows tied to a defined pool of assets. That can be anything from real estate and auto loans to equipment-lease debt. Durkin anticipates that will grow to a $7 trillion-to-$10 trillion market as banks continue to sell loan portfolios, carve out businesses that are no longer considered core and generally retrench from lending. US household debt jumped to a fresh high last quarter, with lower-income groups showing signs of strain. Early delinquency transitions on auto loans, and the share of that debt now in serious delinquency, hit the highest since 2010. “The weaker consumer demographic is feeling the pain of inflation more,” said Durkin “That’s where you really need to do the work.” On the podcast, Durkin also discussed: Why he thinks structured product issuance will continue to grow, even after hitting a record this year, boosted by esoteric deals and data-center financing Interplay between private and public markets for asset-based finance, including warehouse debt and forward-flow deals The 2025 outlook for synthetic risk transfers tied to corporate deals The mergers and acquisition environment under the next US government, particularly for banks Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Musk’s Team of Budget-Slashing MAGA Billionaires Takes Shape What Happens When US Hospitals Go Big on Nurse Practitioners Why the Flying Experience Feels So Much Worse The Charm Bracelet Shop That Keeps Going Viral Top Business Schools See Growing Minority Enrollment ©2024 Bloomberg L.P.","Americans borrowing against their homes after a surge in real estate prices are a opportunity for investors, according Gordon. from Bloomberg York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier In Motor City, Car-Free Options Growing In Traffic-Weary Toronto, a Bike Lanes In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Takes the seeing the evolution of home equity products,” TJ firm’s head of structured credit and said in the latest Bloomberg Intelligence Credit Edge podcast. could be $150 to billion of origination per year, with a trillion really addressable market there.” have the of their since the pandemic.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-faces-broad-antitrust-investigation-205809602.html,"Wed, Nov 27, 2024, 12:58 PM","(Bloomberg) -- The US Federal Trade Commission has opened an antitrust investigation of Microsoft Corp., drilling into everything from the company’s cloud computing and software licensing businesses to cybersecurity offerings and artificial intelligence products. Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Italy’s Motor City, Car-Free Options Are Growing In Traffic-Weary Toronto, a Battle Breaks Out Over Bike Lanes In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field After more than a year of conducting informal interviews with competitors and business partners, antitrust enforcers have crafted a detailed request to force Microsoft to turn over information, according to people familiar with the matter. The demand, which is hundreds of pages long, has been sent to the company after FTC Chair Lina Khan signed off, said one of the people. FTC antitrust lawyers are set to meet with Microsoft competitors next week to gather more information about the Redmond, Washington-based company’s business practices, according to two other people familiar with the plans who like the others asked not to be named discussing a confidential matter. Microsoft and the FTC declined to comment. The FTC’s scrutiny of Microsoft’s cloud computing business gained steam after a string of cybersecurity incidents that involved the company’s products. The company is a top government contractor, providing billions of dollars in software and cloud services to US agencies including the Defense Department. The Microsoft information demand is one of Khan’s parting shots as she steps down after helming one of the most aggressive pushes against consolidated corporate power the agency has delivered in decades. While business leaders are hoping that President-elect Donald Trump will usher in an era of lighter regulation, it will fall to his new FTC chair — still unnamed — to decide how to proceed with the case. The FTC inquiry renews scrutiny of Microsoft for its business practices more than 25 years after the government sued the company over similar conduct involving bundling its Windows operating system and browser and unsuccessfully tried to break it up. A key focus of the current probe is Microsoft’s bundling of both its popular office productivity and security software with its cloud offerings, according to the people familiar with the information request. Microsoft’s cybersecurity failings, combined with its heft as a government contractor, are seen by the FTC as an example of the company’s problematic power over the market, those people said. In a November 2023 report, the FTC highlighted concerns that the concentrated nature of the cloud market means that “outages, or other issues that degrade the service of a cloud provider, could have a cascading impact on the economy or specific sectors.” The CrowdStrike crash that affected millions of devices operating on Microsoft Windows systems earlier this year was itself a testament to the widespread use of the company’s products and how it directly affects the global economy. A portion of the probe is focused on the company’s practices related to security software called Microsoft Entra ID — formerly known as Azure Active Directory — which helps authenticate users logging in to cloud-based software, some of the people said. Competitors have complained that Microsoft’s licensing terms and bundling of software with cloud services makes it harder for rival authentication and cybersecurity companies to compete. Companies such as Salesforce Inc.’s Slack and Zoom Communications Inc. have said that Microsoft’s practice of giving away its Teams video-conferencing software for free in a bundle with popular software products like Word and Excel is anticompetitive and makes it harder for them to compete.

Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Italy’s Motor City, Car-Free Options Are Growing In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field In Traffic-Weary Toronto, a Battle Breaks Out Over Bike Lanes Adjusted earnings will be 84 cents to 86 cents per share in the fiscal fourth quarter, CrowdStrike said Tuesday in a statement. Analysts were expecting 87 cents, according to Bloomberg-compiled estimates. Shares of CrowdStrike fell as much as 4.8% after markets opened in New York on Wednesday. The report is the company’s second since a flawed CrowdStrike update crashed millions of devices operating on Microsoft Corp.’s Windows systems. The outage, which unfolded on July 19, disrupted a wide range of industries, including air travel, banks and health care. The company posted sales three months ago that beat expectations, a sign that investors took to mean the global IT outage wouldn’t significantly affect its finances. Third-quarter revenue represented a bright spot in Tuesday’s report. Sales for the period came to $1.01 billion, exceeding Wall Street’s expectations. Profit, excluding some items, was 93 cents a share, compared with the average estimate of 81 cents. CrowdStrike also raised its guidance for revenue for the full fiscal year, to $3.92 billion to $3.93 billion. Analysts were expecting $3.9 billion. The company excluded roughly $26 million from its annual recurring revenue in the quarter, CrowdStrike Chief Financial Officer Burt Podbere said during the earnings call. That came after a distributor in the federal space provided notice of its intention to exercise transferability rights with respect to a transaction, only for CrowdStrike to conclude that the transaction wouldn’t occur. That transaction remains in revenue in compliance with US revenue recognition rules, CrowdStrike said. CrowdStrike previously agreed to a $32 million deal with Carahsoft Technology Corp., which serves as a middleman between technology companies and government agencies, involving identity protection software intended for the US Internal Revenue Service, Bloomberg reported in October. The IRS didn’t ultimately purchase that software, according to records reviewed by Bloomberg News and people with knowledge of the situation. The company also surpassed $4 billion in ending annual recurring revenue as of Oct. 31, making CrowdStrike “the fastest and only pure play cybersecurity software company to reach this reported milestone,” Chief Executive Officer George Kurtz said in the statement. Delta Airlines’ operations were stunted for days as a result of the outage, costing the airline at least $500 million in out-of-pocket losses, according to a lawsuit it filed against CrowdStrike in October. CrowdStrike said Delta was shifting blame “from its failure to update its antiquated IT infrastructure,” in a statement at the time. “Following this summer’s incident as a company we were tested,” Kurtz said, in a call with investors on Tuesday. “We responded with speed, care and resolve and we focused on becoming even better.” (Updates with share price in the fourth paragraph and additional context in seventh and eighth.)

In its first detailed argument to the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Google said the trial judge made legal errors that unfairly benefited the plaintiff, ""Fortnite"" maker Epic Games. Requiring a ""dramatic redesign"" of Google Play and its mobile-device operating system Android will hurt app developers and consumers, Google said in its court filing. Epic in a statement on Wednesday said Google was relying on “flawed arguments” that the jury rejected. “This meritless appeal is Google’s desperate attempt to avoid complying with the unanimous jury decision,” Epic said. Google declined to comment beyond its court filing. Epic’s 2020 lawsuit accused Google of monopolizing how consumers access apps on Android devices and how they pay for transactions within apps. The Cary, North Carolina-based company persuaded a San Francisco jury last year that Google illegally stifled competition. Based on the jury's findings, U.S. District Judge James Donato ordered Google in October to let users download rival app stores within Play and make Play's app catalog available to those competitors, among other reforms. The order, which would bind Google for three years, is on hold pending review in the 9th Circuit. Google told the appeals court on Wednesday that a jury should never have heard Epic's lawsuit because it sought to enjoin Google's conduct, not collect damages. It said Donato unfairly allowed Epic to tell jurors that Google and Apple are not competitors for app distribution and in-app payments. The filing said Donato was wrong to issue an injunction affecting users and developers nationwide, not just Epic. Google said the order made Donato ""a central planner responsible for product design."" The 9th Circuit said it will hear oral arguments on Feb. 3, with a ruling expected later next year.

(AP) — Two neighbors of a Kentucky plant that was the site of a massive explosion are suing the company, saying the blast earlier this month damaged their homes and caused emotional trauma. Edward Roberts and Ana Carolina Gomez Bridge filed a lawsuit Tuesday against Givaudan Flavors Corporation and its parent company, Givaudan U.S. They say the company was negligent leading up to the Nov. 12 explosion of a cooking vessel inside the plant that destroyed the building, killed two workers and flung debris into nearby yards and homes. The two residents live in the same home that backs up to the plant. “Givaudan failed miserably to operate their business responsibly, and the consequences were catastrophic,"" Tad Thomas, a Louisville lawyer representing the two residents, said in a media release. The company has said they are liable for damages to the surrounding homes. The company’s president, Ann Leonard, said in a community meeting last week that it is likely the plant will be moved out of the neighborhood and rebuilt elsewhere. Last week, the family of one of the plant workers who died in the blast hired lawyers who said they are exploring a lawsuit. Another lawsuit filed against the company last week was from a food delivery driver who was in the area when the explosion happened. Charles Fowler said in the lawsuit that the blast triggered post-traumatic stress disorder from his service during the Iraq war. Dozens of homes around the plant had their windows shattered, and the percussion from the blast knocked pictures off walls and cracked drywall in some homes. Some residents at the community meeting told the company their children were traumatized by the sound. In 911 calls obtained by The Associated Press this week, residents complain of a loud sound and smoke after the afternoon explosion. In one call, a woman reported that she heard “some sort of explosion” outside her home. “It shook the house,” she said. In another call, a man reported that “a building just like exploded nearby” and described in detail what he heard and saw. “There was a huge blast,” he said. “The lights flickered and there’s a bunch of smoke coming out of” the plant. “It smells like something blew up,” he added. According to the latest lawsuit, Roberts was in the basement when the blast happened, knocking out windows and causing foundation damage. Both Roberts and Bridge said they “have been experiencing physical pain and suffering,” and Bridge “has suffered severe emotional distress, requiring her to pursue necessary therapeutic care and treatment,” the lawsuit said. The lawsuit also says that employees had warned the company about the vessel overheating, but Givaudan failed to take any corrective action and continued operations.","Ky.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/uber-faces-ftc-consumer-protection-191104765.html,"Wed, Nov 27, 2024, 11:11 AM","(Bloomberg) -- The US Federal Trade Commission is looking into whether Uber Technologies Inc. violated consumer protection laws with its flagship subscription service. Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Italy’s Motor City, Car-Free Options Are Growing In Traffic-Weary Toronto, a Battle Breaks Out Over Bike Lanes In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field The FTC is investigating Uber after customers complained the company signed them up for the Uber One subscription product without their consent and made it difficult to cancel, according to documents viewed by Bloomberg. The investigation was opened earlier this year. The Uber One subscription program gives discounts on rides and delivery orders in exchange for an annual fee. About 25 million people subscribe to Uber One, the company said in October. Uber confirmed it has received inquiries about the program from the FTC and said it’s cooperating with the agency’s review. “We will continue to answer any questions the FTC may have about our cancellation policies,” said Uber spokesperson Noah Edwardsen in an emailed statement. “The Uber One cancellation process follows both the letter and the spirit of the law: Uber One members can easily cancel their membership in the app — in fact, the majority of those cancellations take 20 seconds or less.” The FTC declined to comment. Uber shares erased earlier gains and were virtually unchanged on Wednesday. Subscription Terms The FTC enforces consumer protection laws against companies that mislead consumers about subscription terms. The agency has recently sued several companies, including Amazon.com Inc. and Adobe Inc., for allegedly making it too difficult to cancel subscriptions. FTC consumer protection probes don’t always lead to enforcement actions. The agency often seeks monetary penalties in settlements because its ability to win fines in court is limited and was pared back further by a 2021 Supreme Court decision. Earlier this year, the agency voted 3-2 to finalize a rule that would force businesses to make it easier for consumers to cancel, with both of the agency’s Republicans dissenting. The rule is now wrapped up in litigation after being challenged by business groups. Enforcement agencies in the waning days of an administration often seek to wrap up probes, even as officials likely to remain with the incoming team push for delays. Days after the Nov. 5 presidential election, the FTC sent a proposed complaint to Uber seeking to resolve the investigation via a settlement and asked for a response within a week. Uber made a counter proposal. The FTC’s settlement offer sought an “enormous monetary amount” for alleged violations of the law less than two months after the agency opened its probe, according to a letter Uber’s outside counsel sent to the agency’s five commissioners complaining about the rushed negotiations. Uber Counteroffer Uber’s lawyers said its counteroffer to was rejected by the staff. The attorneys criticized the agency’s staff for “attempting to cram through any case in record time” ahead of Donald Trump taking office in January. Republican FTC Commissioner Melissa Holyoak forwarded the letter in an email to all of the FTC’s consumer protection staff, saying she found the allegations “highly concerning” and a potential “rush to judgment before the upcoming change in administration.” She requested the consumer protection staff provide an update on all cases it is seeking to resolve in the next two months. Holyoak is under consideration to become the FTC’s chair once Trump takes office, along with her fellow Republican Commissioner Andrew Ferguson and a number of outside candidates, Bloomberg has reported. The president-elect has yet to name a new head for the agency. Holyoak declined to comment. --With assistance from Lynn Doan. (Updates with shares in seventh paragraph.)

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/canada-already-examining-tariffs-certain-205118879.html,"Wed, Nov 27, 2024, 12:51 PM","TORONTO (AP) — Canada is already examining possible retaliatory tariffs on certain items from the United States should President-elect Donald Trump follow through on his threat to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian products, a senior official said Wednesday. Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on products from Canada and Mexico if the countries don't stop what he called the flow of drugs and migrants across southern and northern borders. He said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico as one of his first executive orders. A Canadian government official said Canada is preparing for every eventuality and has started thinking about what items to target with tariffs in retaliation. The official stressed no decision has been made. The person spoke on condition of anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly. When Trump imposed higher tariffs during his first term in office, other countries responded with retaliatory tariffs of their own. Canada, for instance, announced billions of new duties in 2018 against the U.S. in a tit-for-tat response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum. Many of the U.S. products were chosen for their political rather than economic impact. For example, Canada imports $3 million worth of yogurt from the U.S. annually and most comes from one plant in Wisconsin, home state of then-House Speaker Paul Ryan. That product was hit with a 10% duty. Another product on the list was whiskey, which comes from Tennessee and Kentucky, the latter of which is the home state of then-Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell. Trump made the threat Monday while railing against an influx of illegal migrants, even though the numbers at Canadian border pale in comparison to the southern border. The U.S. Border Patrol made 56,530 arrests at the Mexican border in October alone — and 23,721 arrests at the Canadian one between October 2023 and September 2024. Canadian officials say lumping Canada in with Mexico is unfair but say they are happy to work with the Trump administration to lower the numbers from Canada. The Canadians are also worried about a influx north of migrants if Trump follows through with his plan for mass deportations. Trump also railed about fentanyl from Mexico and Canada, even though seizures from the Canadian border pale in comparison to the Mexican border. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border. Canadian officials argue their country is not the problem and that tariffs will have severe implications for both countries. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports are from Canada. Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security. “Canada is essential to the United States’ domestic energy supply,” Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said. Trump has pledged to cut American energy bills in half within 18 months, something that could be made harder if a 25% premium is added to Canadian oil imports. In 2023, Canadian oil accounted for almost two-thirds of total U.S. oil imports and about one-fifth of the U.S. oil supply. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is holding a emergency virtual meeting on Wednesday with the leaders of Canada's provinces, who want Trudeau to negotiate a bilateral trade deal with the United States that excludes Mexico.

Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Italy’s Motor City, Car-Free Options Are Growing In Traffic-Weary Toronto, a Battle Breaks Out Over Bike Lanes In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field The economist, who also runs Roubini Macro Associates, is positioning for a curve steepener, a popular Treasuries trade where the gap between long- and short-dated yields widens. Dubbed the “Trump trade” by some, the strategy stands to benefit from interest-rate cuts. “All the inflationary shocks that had spread before implied that the long bond yields are going to be higher, both in nominal terms and in real terms,” Roubini said on Bloomberg’s ETF IQ Wednesday. “Therefore, you need an alternative — an alternative that combines things that do well when inflation is higher.” Roubini, who built his reputation by correctly warning of a disaster ahead of the 2008 financial crisis, expects traditional haven trades, like the popular 60/40 portfolio and long-duration US Treasuries, will underperform in an inflationary environment, one that he predicts will worsen if Trump’s tariff and immigration plans come to fruition. “In a world in which gradually inflation goes higher, you lose on the equity part of your portfolio and you lose also on the bond portion of your portfolio,” he said. Roubini’s newly minted Atlas America Fund (ticker USAF) counts shorter-term Treasury ETFs as its biggest constituents. Other holdings include exchange-traded funds tracking gold trusts, climate-change resilient real estate investment trusts, municipal securities and corporate bonds. USAF is Roubini’s first ETF launched through Atlas Capital Team, a fintech company that he co-founded to help develop investing strategies that protect against high-risk scenarios including out-of-control inflation, climate change and civil unrest. “In a world in which average inflation might be 5% rather than 2%, bond yields may be closer to 7% to 8% rather than the current 4%-plus,” Roubini said. That subjects Treasuries, traditionally safe assets, “to massive price risks.” Roubini, who famously called Bitcoin “the mother of all bubbles,” is still steering clear from the world’s largest cryptocurrency, which advocates tout as an alternative store of value in a world of elevated inflation risk. “Bitcoin is highly volatile,” he said. “If you want wealth preservation rather than high volatility, you want to stay away from those types of assets.” --With assistance from Scarlet Fu and Eric Balchunas.

Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Italy’s Motor City, Car-Free Options Are Growing In Traffic-Weary Toronto, a Battle Breaks Out Over Bike Lanes In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field Finance Minister Fernando Haddad, who opposed Lula’s push to include the tax measure, is now set to unveil it alongside the spending cuts, according to a person familiar with the situation who requested anonymity to discuss internal matters. The finance chief is planning to present and detail the package at a Thursday morning press conference, two people familiar with his plans said, after delivering a recorded address to the nation Wednesday night. The tax proposal will excuse workers with monthly salaries of up to 5,000 reais ($844.5) from paying income taxes, according to two other officials with knowledge of the matter, seeking to deliver on a longstanding pledge from the leftist Lula. O Globo first reported that it would be included in the announcement. The real weakened as much as 2%, the worst performance in emerging markets, to its lowest since 2020. Stocks slumped to session lows and swap rates surged more than 50 basis points. “Putting tax cuts in the spending reduction bill is upsetting the markets,” said Greg Lesko, managing director at Deltec Asset Management LLC in New York. Investors are “awaiting details of the spending cuts, but it’s hard to close the fiscal gap this way.” Brazil’s government was initially expected to announce the cuts to public spending earlier this month following local elections, and delays have put investors on edge. A local media report on Tuesday that congressional votes on the reductions could only come next year prompted local assets to temporarily slip. Markets are clamoring for austerity after Lula’s government increased expenditures to improve living standards for the working class. Lula will meet with Haddad, ministers and congressional heads Arthur Lira and Rodrigo Pacheco on Wednesday afternoon to discuss the package, according to other people familiar with the plans. The gathering was first reported by local press. Last month, the leftist head of state said he wanted even bigger income tax exemptions beyond his existing promise for workers with salaries of up to 5,000 reais, adding to investor worries about the budget. The plan will come with revenue measures to offset the exemption, according to the person familiar. But that is unlikely to calm market jitters. “This decision to send it along with the package shows how much the government remains resistant to spending cuts and concerned about popularity,” said Anna Reis, chief economist at Gap Asset in Rio de Janeiro. “That’s not a good sign for what will come in the spending cut package and in the next two years of government.” Signs that the administration was abandoning pledges for fiscal responsibility have wreaked havoc on local assets in 2024. The real has posted the biggest drop among 16 major currencies so far this year, stocks are trailing most global gauges and interest rate futures have surged. Brazil will end 2024 with a 68.8 billion-real primary fiscal deficit, which excludes interest payments, according to a budget report released in September. For 2025, the government plans to eliminate that gap with the help of 166.4 billion reais in extraordinary revenue. In April, it backed off its pledge for a surplus next year, sparking a wave of investor angst. --With assistance from Giovanna Bellotti Azevedo and Leda Alvim.

The comment on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) follows Musk's recent appointment to a government efficiency role, further amplifying the influence of the world's richest man, who donated millions of dollars to helping Trump get elected.

On Tuesday, Ai2, the nonprofit AI research organization founded by the late Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, released OLMo 2, the second family of models in its OLMo series. (OLMo is short for ""open language model."") While there's no shortage of ""open"" language models to choose from (e.g., Meta's Llama), OLMo 2 meets the Open Source Initiative's definition of open source AI, meaning the tools and data used to develop it are publicly available. The Open Source Initiative, the long-running institution that aims to define and ""steward"" all things open source, finalized its open source AI definition in October. But the first OLMo models, released in February, met the criterion as well. ""OLMo 2 [was] developed start-to-finish with open and accessible training data, open-source training code, reproducible training recipes, transparent evaluations, intermediate checkpoints, and more,"" AI2 wrote in a blog post. ""By openly sharing our data, recipes, and findings, we hope to provide the open-source community with the resources needed to discover new and innovative approaches."" There are two models in the OLMo 2 family: one with 7 billion parameters (OLMo 7B) and one with 13 billion parameters (OLMo 13B). Parameters roughly correspond to a model’s problem-solving skills, and models with more parameters generally perform better than those with fewer parameters. Like most language models, OLMo 2 7B and 13B can perform a range of text-based tasks, like answering questions, summarizing documents, and writing code. To train the models, Ai2 used a dataset of 5 trillion tokens. Tokens represent bits of raw data; 1 million tokens is equal to about 750,000 words. The training set included websites ""filtered for high quality,"" academic papers, Q&A discussion boards, and math workbooks ""both synthetic and human generated."" Ai2 claims the result is models that are competitive, performance-wise, with open models like Meta's Llama 3.1 release. ""Not only do we observe a dramatic improvement in performance across all tasks compared to our earlier OLMo model but, notably, OLMo 2 7B outperforms Llama 3.1 8B,"" Ai2 writes. ""OLMo 2 [represents] the best fully-open language models to date."" The OLMo 2 models and all of their components can be downloaded from Ai2's website. They're under Apache 2.0 license, meaning they can be used commercially. There's been some debate recently over the safety of open models, what with Llama models reportedly being used by Chinese researchers to develop defense tools. When I asked Ai2 engineer Dirk Groeneveld in February whether he was concerned about OLMo being abused, he said that he believes the benefits ultimately outweigh the harms. ""Yes, it’s possible open models may be used inappropriately or for unintended purposes,"" he said.

But his threats, if carried out, potentially threaten to upset inflation and investment and disrupt the broader economic cycle. New duties on imports could reverse some of the hard-won progress on inflation that the Federal Reserve is still struggling to maintain. Meanwhile, making it more expensive to import goods from the nation's neighbors to the north and south may also widen the trade deficit, weighing on investments elsewhere. In seeking to deliver campaign promises to secure the border and establish favorable trade conditions — Trump said these tariffs are aimed at curbing what he described as an ""invasion"" of drugs and migrants into the US — Trump risks worsening the inflation woes that turned voters across the globe against incumbents and helped catapult him to power. Chief among the knock-on effects of imposing tariffs is how the costs might be passed on to US consumers. In a research note Tuesday, economists at Pantheon Macroeconomics wrote that, in a simple, static analysis, overall prices for US goods imports would jump by 8% if Trump imposes a 25% tariff on all goods imports from Canada and Mexico and an extra 10% tariff on those from China. This would push headline PCE up by 0.9%, taking Wednesday's reading of a 2.3% annual jump in prices back above 3%. The analysis also comes as new data on Wednesday showed the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge — core PCE, which strips out food and energy costs — moving ""sideways,"" and raising questions over whether progress toward the central bank's 2% inflation goal has stalled. Pantheon's team, led by Samuel Tombs, added, however, that the boost in consumer prices would be smaller than that crude calculation suggests. A range of mitigating factors would lessen the blow to Americans, including a change in trade flows and retailers absorbing some of the increased costs. But tariffs may have another negative effect as companies figure out how to react to Trump's coming orders. ""The threatened tariffs on Canada and Mexico will motivate US importers to front-load imports and accumulate inventories, regardless of whether the tariffs are implemented,"" Barclays economists led by Pooja Sriram wrote in a research note on Tuesday. ""The 25% tariffs could intensify this pull-forward effect, leading to an even stronger surge in imports in late 2024 and early 2025, thereby widening the trade deficit."" The gamesmanship and uncertainty that could surround even the discussion of potential tariffs may also further diminish economic prospects. ""Temporary and uncertain tariffs of this nature create natural incentives to delay investments, as businesses await more information about the longer-term viability of prevailing supply chains and their alternatives before committing to capex,"" Barclays added. Of course, many observers expect Trump's tariff threats to have more bark than bite. For its part, Barclays wrote, ""Our baseline is that the tariffs on Mexico and Canada likely will, ultimately, not be implemented."" But the incentives for businesses to get ahead of rising future costs — even if those costs turn out to be hypothetical — could interfere with broader spending plans at both the corporate and sovereign levels. ""[These] threats are a remarkably effective tool, at least against countries where exports to the US amount to 20% of GDP or more,"" wrote Capital Economics' Paul Ashworth in a client note on Wednesday. ""There will undoubtedly be more threats, with allies targeted just as much as traditional adversaries."" Hamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gop-control-washington-drive-more-211419417.html,"Wed, Nov 27, 2024, 1:14 PM","The stock price of private student lender Sallie Mae has surged in the wake of President-elect Donald Trump's victory, since investors are hoping that federal student loans will be scaled back under Republican power, driving more business to the private sector. Trump's victory, along with incoming GOP majorities in both the House and Senate, has renewed talk that federal loans to both graduate students and parents of undergraduates will be either curtailed or eliminated. Sallie Mae's stock has ripped 23% since the election. If major student loan reforms get enacted, the company's dominance in the private market could position it to gain lots of additional customers who would've previously turned to the federal government. ""Given the size of these programs, even minor cuts or curtailments could have a material positive impact to SLM's origination volume potential,"" Compass Point Research analyst Giuliano Bologna wrote in a note to clients, referring to Sallie Mae's stock ticker. Sallie Mae, once part of the federal government, makes more than half of the nearly $14 billion in private higher education loans taken out every year, Bologna wrote. If the company does see a boon, it will be because the two so-called PLUS programs comprise an even bigger market. The U.S. government made nearly $11 billion in parent PLUS loans last year, plus another $13 billion in graduate PLUS loans. If the programs are scaled back, not every affected borrower would meet Sallie Mae's underwriting standards. And even though some other banks have retreated from student lending — Discover Financial Services is the latest example — lenders backed by private equity firms are increasingly sensing an opportunity. So Sallie Mae would not get the entire pie under a scenario where more borrowers need to turn to private lenders. Still, analysts predict a meaningful boost to Sallie Mae's earnings if it captures a big chunk of PLUS borrowers. The company's relatively small graduate-school loan portfolio would suddenly make up a larger share of its business, TD Cowen analyst Moshe Orenbuch wrote in a note to clients. And while Sallie Mae stopped offering loans to students' parents in 2021, it could restart the program if the federal government limits Parent PLUS loans, Orenbuch added. There's a ""growing consensus"" on Capitol Hill that some sort of student loan changes are necessary, Peter Graham, Sallie Mae's chief financial officer, said at a conference in September. Such actions could include caps to the PLUS programs, Graham said in his preelection comments, though he also noted that lawmakers could increase grants to students with greater financial need. ""Sallie Mae has long advocated for thoughtful federal student lending reform that balances the priorities of access, affordability, and completion while ensuring families do not borrow beyond their means,"" Sallie Mae spokesman Rick Castellano told American Banker in an email. ""We hope to see continued progress for this important work."" Some conservatives want to go beyond curtailing federal student loans. The Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 document recommends scrapping the U.S. government's role in student lending entirely. ""The federal government does not have the proper incentives to make sound lending decisions, so the new Administration should consider returning to a system in which private lenders, backed by government guarantees, would compete to offer student loans,"" the Project 2025 document says. If such a major overhaul proves not to be possible, the Heritage Foundation recommends a series of changes to undergraduate loans, plus an elimination of PLUS loans for graduate students and undergrads' parents. Doing so would save money and reduce ""redundant"" programs, the document says, noting that the federal government offers graduate loans through the Stafford loan program and that private lenders offer loans to parents. The Student Borrower Protection Center, a progressive group that focuses on reducing student debt, is sounding alarms over the potential elimination, or capping, of PLUS loans. Scrapping the programs would ""leave students and borrowers at the mercy of these private and less accountable companies,"" said Persis Yu, the group's deputy executive director. Private student loans may come with higher interest rates and without the same types of protections that the federal government offers, Yu noted. Those safeguards include the ability to make payments that are based on the borrower's income, along with the possibility of loan forgiveness if borrowers work in public service. Other borrowers may be shut out based on private lenders' underwriting criteria, Yu noted, nixing their hopes of landing jobs that increasingly require graduate education. Those jobs include positions where salaries are relatively low compared to those of doctors or lawyers. ""That's part of the goal of the Higher Education Act, is to provide access,"" Yu said, referring to the 1965 law that governs federal student loans. ""Because we do want folks from low-income communities and communities of color to be able to become social workers and nurses and teachers."" Similar concerns have scuttled past efforts to cut back the PLUS programs, said Jason Delisle, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute and a former Republican staffer on Capitol Hill. While there's still some appetite for curtailments, certain lawmakers who are skeptical of the programs may end up getting ""cold feet,"" Delisle said. ""There's a lot of bark,"" he said. ""I don't know how much bite there is."" Terry Ma, a Barclays analyst who covers Sallie Mae, said lawmakers could decide to pair any reduction to the PLUS programs with an expansion in the amount that undergraduates can borrow. Undergrads can currently borrow between $5,500 and $12,500 a year from the federal government, depending on their year in school and whether their parents claim them as dependents, according to the Congressional Research Service. Any increases in those limits could reduce the amount of extra financing that undergrads need from Sallie Mae and its competitors, Ma said. But no matter what changes come from Washington D.C., Sallie Mae has some ""real momentum"" that's also driving its recent stock gains, Ma said. Discover, once a major name in private student lending, has left the market after a series of regulatory struggles. The private equity giants Caryle and KKR bought Discover's $10.1 billion portfolio, signaling that their investors have an appetite for private student loans. Sallie Mae, which has a ""dominant market share,"" is set to pick up a large chunk of business from Discover's exit, Ma said.","The stock price of private student lender Sallie Mae has surged in the of President-elect victory, since investors federal student loans will back Republican driving more business to private sector.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackrock-vanguard-accused-violating-antitrust-135317552.html,"Wed, Nov 27, 2024, 12:15 PM","(Bloomberg) -- BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group Inc. and State Street Corp. were sued by a group of states led by Texas for allegedly breaking antitrust law by boosting electricity prices through their investments, in the highest-profile lawsuit yet against the beleaguered ESG industry. Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Italy’s Motor City, Car-Free Options Are Growing In Traffic-Weary Toronto, a Battle Breaks Out Over Bike Lanes In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and 10 other states claim the money managers, as part of their green agenda, combined their market clout and membership in climate groups to pressure coal producers to cut output. Shortages have caused Texans and residents of the other states to pay higher power bills, according to the lawsuit, filed Wednesday in federal court in Texas. “Competitive markets — not the dictates of far-flung asset managers — should determine the price Americans pay for electricity,” the attorneys general wrote in the complaint. The Republican-led states, including West Virginia and Montana, are asking the court to bar the three largest US investment firms from using their stock in coal companies to vote on shareholder resolutions and take other steps in a way that restrains output and limits market competition. BlackRock said in a statement that the lawsuit “undermines Texas’ pro-business reputation” and added that “the suggestion that BlackRock invested money in companies with the goal of harming those companies is baseless and defies common sense.” Vanguard declined to comment, while State Street hasn’t provided a comment. The complaint marks the culmination of a years-long investigation by GOP officials who have taken aim at Wall Street’s efforts to address climate change, the main pillar of the environmental, social and governance strategy. Pressure has mounted on investment firms since last year when state attorneys general warned them that Americans’ savings shouldn’t be used to “push political goals” during the shareholder voting season. In response, climate advocates have said environmental risks are financial risks and that addressing them is among investors’ fiduciary responsibilities. “Texas won’t tolerate the illegal weaponization of the financial industry in service of a destructive, politicized ‘environmental’ agenda,” Paxton said in a statement on Wednesday. “Their conspiracy has harmed American energy production and hurt consumers. This is a stunning violation of State and federal law.” Paxton cited a 1914 federal law, the Clayton Antitrust Act, that outlaws buying shares with the result of substantially reducing competition. The lawsuit alleges that BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street used their shareholdings in coal companies, including Peabody Energy Corp. and Arch Resources Inc., to push management to lower carbon emissions, while producing “cartel-level profits” for the investors. This started in 2021 at the height of the ESG boom. The investment firms joined groups such as Climate Action 100+ and Net Zero Asset Managers Initiative. By doing so, they formed “a syndicate and agreed to use their collective holdings of publicly traded coal companies to induce industrywide output reductions,” according to the suit. Climate coalitions are “voluntary associations and therefore don’t include any form of collusion and coercion, so it’s hard to see a legal basis for this claim,” said Lisa Sachs, director of sustainable investment at Columbia University’s law school. But “coal-financed politicians are now using the bully pulpit to scare financial institutions, which won’t in any way benefit the coal sector and will harm the constituents these AGs purport to represent.” US coal producers have been under pressure in recent years from cheaper natural gas and renewable energy. In Texas, for example, coal now accounts for less than 10% of the state’s generating capacity, down from 18% in 2020, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. Republican lawmakers have been critical of Wall Street’s ESG efforts. They have launched probes and introduced anti-ESG bills — many of which have failed — and some states pulled money from investment firms. US banks and asset managers are talking much less about ESG topics these days, and some have left climate groups. State Street Global Advisors said in February that it quit CA100+ because of requirements that are inconsistent with the firm’s “independent approach” to shareholder voting. BlackRock said only a unit that contains most funds focused on decarbonization will remain a member of CA100+. Vanguard left NZAM in 2022 and was never part of CA100+, while BlackRock and State Street Global Advisors remain members of NZAM, which is part of the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero. In the suit, the states acknowledge those departures, but they don’t “change the reality that defendants’ holdings threaten to substantially reduce competition in violation of Section 7 of the Clayton Act.” The complaint comes after Texas Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick praised BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink earlier this year at a summit focused on investments in the state’s fragile power grid. The case is Texas v. BlackRock, 24-cv-00437, US District Court, Eastern District of Texas (Tyler). (Bloomberg Philanthropies’ work with the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign has helped retire over 70% of the nation’s coal plants since 2011.

The company sold 20 million ADS in the offering for $13 per ADS, the top of the marketed range, to raise $260 million. Separately, a group of investors agreed to buy $153.4 million worth of ordinary shares from the company in a private placement. One ADS is equivalent to one ordinary share. The pricing gives the Guangzhou-based firm a market value of nearly $5.4 billion, based on the outstanding ADS. Pony’s pricing was pushed back from last week as the firm increased the deal size and addressed regulator questions, Bloomberg News reported. Uber Technologies Inc. was among those indicating interest in Pony AI shares, people familiar with the matter have said. The IPO adds to the modest revival in Chinese companies listing in the US, led by auto firms including self-driving car company WeRide Inc. and EV maker Zeekr Intelligent Technology Holding Ltd. With Pony’s offering, Chinese companies have raised $1.2 billion via US IPOs this year, nearly double the amount in the same period in 2023 but below the heights seen during the pandemic. A unit of state-owned automaker Beijing Automotive Group Co., and the venture capital arm of Singaporean taxi firm ComfortDelGro Corp. had indicated an interest in purchasing as much as roughly $75 million worth of Pony’s offering, according to an earlier filing. Pony develops and operates self-driving vehicles including trucks and robotaxis in the US and China. The company has permits to provide fully driverless taxi services in Beijing, Shenzhen and Guangzhou, and has a fleet of over 250 robotaxis as well as over 190 robotrucks. Its limited US-based testing involves no more than 10 vehicles, the filings show. The company is tapping US capital markets as President-elect Donald Trump’s second administration considers moves that could ramp up competition in the autonomous-driving sector, where the US and China are neck and neck in funding. The two countries also have the most robotaxi startups globally. Pony.ai’s backers also include Saudi Arabia’s Neom Co., the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan Board and HongShan Capital Group, the firm formerly known as Sequoia Capital China. The company has a joint venture with Guangzhou Automobile Group and the Chinese arm of Toyota Motor Corp. The offering was led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Bank of America Corp.

Raymond Epps, a former Marine, was falsely accused by Fox of being a government agent causing trouble near the Capitol that day so that it would be blamed on Trump fans.

While sales in HP’s PC unit rose 2% to $9.59 billion in the similar three-month period, that too missed the average analyst estimate. “The PC refresh cycle is pushing into next year,” Dell Chief Financial Officer Yvonne McGill said Tuesday on a call with analysts after the results were announced. HP Chief Executive Officer Enrique Lores said in an interview that the release of Microsoft Corp.’s new edition of Windows software hasn’t fueled PC sales from corporate clients as quickly as in previous releases. The market had seen a historic decline in recent years after a burst of demand for new laptops in the early months of the pandemic when students and corporate employees were stuck at home. While signs of a rebound began to materialize this year, shipments again dipped in the third quarter, industry analyst IDC said in October. PC makers had hoped that new machines touted as better for artificial intelligence workloads would spur demand. But “buyers have yet to see clear benefits or business value,” Mikako Kitagawa, an analyst at Gartner Inc., said in report last month. Dell shares fell as much as 14% after markets opened in New York on Wednesday, their biggest intraday drop since May. HP shares fell as much as 10%, their largest same-day decline since August 2023. Dell is best known for its computer business, but the Round Rock, Texas-based company has enjoyed a renaissance of investor interest due to its high-powered servers for artificial intelligence workloads. Earlier this month, Dell announced it was shipping servers with Nvidia Corp.’s new Blackwell semiconductors to cloud infrastructure provider CoreWeave. Sales in Dell’s infrastructure unit including servers rose 34% to $11.4 billion in the period ended Nov. 1, the company said Tuesday in a statement. That’s just ahead of the $11.3 billion anticipated by analysts. Total revenue increased 10% to $24.4 billion, missing the average analyst estimate of $24.6 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The company shipped $2.9 billion in AI-optimized servers in the quarter, executives said. The metric was a step down from the $3.1 billion reported in the preceding period. “AI is a robust opportunity for us with no signs of slowing down,” Dell Chief Operating Officer Jeff Clarke said in the statement. He touted orders of AI servers in the quarter hitting $3.6 billion and growth “across all customer types.” For the quarter ending in February, Dell gave a revenue outlook of about $24.5 billion. Analysts, on average, projected $25.4 billion. Adjusted earnings will be $2.40 a share to $2.60, compared with the average estimate of $2.66. HP’s outlook also failed to impress.

Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Italy’s Motor City, Car-Free Options Are Growing In Traffic-Weary Toronto, a Battle Breaks Out Over Bike Lanes In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field The three firms are part of a group that owns Spirit’s 8% senior secured notes due in 2025 and is supporting the company’s restructuring plan, according to a Monday court filing. Those notes, along with convertible bonds, will be exchanged for equity in Spirit once it exits bankruptcy next year, according to a description of the restructuring plan submitted in bankruptcy court. About $1.11 billion in senior notes were outstanding at the time Spirit filed Chapter 11 earlier this month. Citadel is the largest single holder of senior notes in the ad hoc group, owning roughly $149.3 million of the debt through affiliates, funds or accounts it manages, according to court documents. Pimco owns $136.4 million, while Franklin Resources Inc.’s Wamco holds $106.9 million, court documents show. Other large holders on the ad-hoc committee include AllianceBernstein Holding LP, Arena Capital Advisors and Ares Management Corp. Lawyers representing the ad hoc committee didn’t respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. Under the terms of the proposed restructuring, which must be approved by a New York bankruptcy judge, about $795 million worth of senior notes and additional convertible notes will be swapped for Spirit’s equity. A separate ad hoc group of convertible noteholders was disclosed in court earlier this month and includes affiliates of Cyrus Capital Partners LP and Shaolin Capital Management. The restructuring plan also calls for the new issuance of $700 million in senior secured notes and $140 million of convertible notes as Chapter 11 exit financing, according to court documents. Spirit will also raise $350 million through an equity rights offering, which is fully backstopped. Spirit filed for bankruptcy earlier this month, after a proposed merger with JetBlue Airways Corp. fell through.

Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Italy’s Motor City, Car-Free Options Are Growing In Traffic-Weary Toronto, a Battle Breaks Out Over Bike Lanes In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field Revenue exceeded $700 million in 2023, Chief Executive Officer Daniel Yanisse said in an interview. In 2021, he described sales as “well above $200 million.” Over the past year, the San Francisco-based company has signed on large clients including OpenAI, Kia Corp., Birkenstock Holding and Subway, helping it notch 100,000 North American active customers in the period. The company declined to disclose its latest valuation. It said it was valued at $5 billion in April 2022, when it raised $120 million in an extension of its Series E round. This latest financial disclosure underscores Checkr’s efforts to ensure long-term growth beyond just serving the gig-economy industry. The company continues to consider an initial public offering as it had in 2021, but declined to commit to a time frame. Earlier this year, the company laid off 382 workers, or 32% of its staff, in an effort to protect the “long-term health” of the business, a spokesperson said. The firm currently has more than 750 employees, including newly appointed C-suite executives like its chief product officer, chief technology officer and chief operating officer, who the spokesperson said would lead the company in its “next chapter of growth.” When Checkr was founded 10 years ago, it focused on the budding gig economy that saw the rise of Uber Technologies Inc. and DoorDash Inc. It helped these companies scale their services quickly as its software was capable of handling large volumes of background checks on millions of drivers and couriers. Unlike traditional background check services that require manual work like gathering documents from various government and judicial systems about an individual’s history, Checkr maintains partnerships with governments so it can tap a large digital database of public records. Even as rideshare and delivery marketplaces have begun to mature, the growing appeal of remote and flexible work has allowed Checkr to offer its services to other types of corporate customers. “We are seeing an explosion of job and work marketplaces for health care, for accountants, for any professional job that you can think of,” Yanisse said. More recently, Checkr has expanded its customer base to include non-tech sectors such as retail, manufacturing and hospitality. It also introduced a personal background-check product this year, letting individuals ensure the accuracy of their history before it’s seen by banks, landlords and potential employers. Over the next few years, the company hopes to expand to new markets beyond North America. “There’s lots of demand for us in Europe and in English-speaking countries,” Yanisse said.

However, the company's CEO, Rohan Nayak, believes that the platform still has room to grow in terms of creating original content and expanding its library to multiple genres and subgenres. The fastest way to do that is to tap into AI tools that would help in audio production, writing strategies, and adapting those stories for different geographies. “I still feel that our content catalog is not sufficient for our users. There are so many genres and subgenres that we don't have in our library. I don't think we have a depth of content that is in the mature entertainment category,” Nayak told TechCrunch over a call. The company already has an outstanding partnership with ElevenLabs to convert writings into audio series. This has resulted in 5x quicker production and 30x lower cost as compared to a professionally generated audio series. “We have already tested how these AI adaptations perform in different markets, and we have seen encouraging results. We are still refining our models for errors, but we feel the technology is good enough to use in the production of shows,” Nayak said. One of the AI tools Pocket FM is trying out caters to the adoption of stories in different regions. The company said it has trained in-house models that don't look at mere translation but handle cultural nuances when converting stories of one region to another. He added that it is challenging to solve the hallucination of the models in the context of stories that span hundreds of episodes. Pocket FM said it had to tackle the limitation of context windows of open source models and also build maps of relations between different entities in a story to maintain character consistency. Another tool for writers the company is testing works as a creative assistant to them, helping them with alternative storylines or giving them ideas about plots. The company also plans to infuse some insights from its historical data in the tool to indicate to writers what works on the platform. Nayak mentioned that while this tool is in its early stages, the company wants to give the power of a writer's room to a solo writer, who might be putting out an episode of a day. He noted that the writer's room gives you the ability to brainstorm without taking out creative controls, and that's the core idea behind this writing assistant. Additionally, the company is investing in creating a blockbuster engine that will feed on insights from the platform about what shows are becoming a hit. The end goal of Pocket FM is to scale its catalog, given that it is producing some content on its own and creating shows through its network of writers. But to scale and become more popular, it has to create hit shows. “Blockbusters is what drives any content platform. While we have a good top of the funnel with user-generated content, it is still a hard problem to spot blockbusters.” Pocket FM has seen encouraging results with its AI deployment. It has more than 40,000 series on the platform with help from AI in terms of voice creation. Plus, the company has generated $3 million in revenue from them. Overall, the platform clocked in $127 million in financial year 2024. The most difficult challenge for the company is to strike the right balance of AI helping creatives and churning out content quickly. There is always a risk of people using AI to speed up content production and compromise quality. As a result, the platform becomes filled with mediocre content, and it becomes tricky for algorithms to highlight good shows. Puneet Sharma, an India-based writer and lyricist, pointed out that in a world where so much work is formulaic, artists will have an onus to prove their authentic work. Sharma added that AI tools can help writers generate ideas and learn different styles. But this means that in the process of using these tools, the process of learning through failure could be lost. Nayak said that some of its writers and creatives already use AI tools. The idea for the company is to provide tools with the context of stories and the platform. Pocket FM has raised $197 million in funding across multiple rounds with backers, including Lightspeed Ventures, Tencent, and Times Internet. The company competes on multiple fronts with other content players, such as Audible, Omidyar Network-backed Pratilipi and Google-backed Kuku FM.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trafigura-bets-troubled-carbon-credits-200000332.html,"Wed, Nov 27, 2024, 12:00 PM","(Bloomberg) -- Trafigura Group, the commodities trading giant, is positioning for record growth in the beleaguered market for carbon credits, as it bets new regulatory frameworks will propel the instruments into the mainstream of emissions accounting. Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Italy’s Motor City, Car-Free Options Are Growing In Traffic-Weary Toronto, a Battle Breaks Out Over Bike Lanes In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field Across jurisdictions, “increased and mounting regulation” designed to rein in emissions is reshaping the market for carbon credits, said Hannah Hauman, global head of carbon trading at Trafigura. The development means that a product once treated as a form of “corporate experimentation” is now set to join the ranks of “investment-grade assets and operations,” she said during a recent interview in Azerbaijan. Carbon credits, which companies use to compensate for their emissions, have emerged as one of the more controversial corners of climate finance. Recurring allegations of greenwashing last year coincided with a 23% slump in the value of the so-called voluntary carbon market on which such credits are traded, as bankers and corporations backed away. HSBC Holdings Plc has now shelved plans to build a carbon credits trading and finance desk. Shell Plc is taking steps to sell a majority stake in its portfolio of nature-based carbon credit projects. And Delta Air Lines Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Easyjet Plc are among companies that have retreated from the market. At the same time, regulators in Europe, the US and Asia have come around to the view that many companies won’t be able to report net zero emissions by mid-century without access to a functioning and effective market for carbon credits, particularly removals-based units. All three regions are developing frameworks to make that possible. And at the COP29 summit in the Azeri capital of Baku, negotiators landed an agreement to advance rules for a new market guided by the United Nations. There’s a UN-backed global crediting mechanism under what’s known as Article 6.4. And there’s also guidance on how countries can account for the units they exchange as they strive to meet national climate targets, known as Article 6.2. The decision on Article 6.4 in particular is an “enormous” development, Hauman said. “That’s now basically giving a rubber-stamped rulebook for countries globally” showing them how to participate in the market, she said. Carbon market experts and climate campaigners, meanwhile, are urging caution. Article 6.2, which focuses on how countries can exchange so-called internationally transferred mitigation outcomes to help meet their climate targets, looks set to become an “anything goes” market, according to Danny Cullenward, senior fellow at the Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania. Already the market has been designed to allow countries to set their own terms for what counts as a high-quality credit. And the agreement in Baku now turns what was initially intended as a “multilateral accounting regime” into a “carbon-trading regime,” Cullenward said. That risks undermining both the better designed Article 6.4 market, as well as wider climate action, he said. A carbon credit is supposed to represent 1 metric ton of emissions that have been avoided, reduced or removed from the atmosphere. They’re sold by project developers — often in developing economies — that invest in areas such as reforestation. Companies buying credits then claim to have compensated for their emissions. In practice, however, studies have uncovered widespread instances of projects issuing more credits than they merit. Trafigura, which is the world’s largest trader of carbon-removal credits, has had to contend with the fallout of questionable projects in the past. In 2023, it was among firms left with a consignment of what Hauman described at the time as “defunct assets.” With new regulations now falling into place, Hauman said Trafigura is now needing to develop new carbon credit projects to respond to rising demand. “That’s true in all of our markets,” she said. Hauman notes that for the first time, companies under pressure to reduce their emissions have a “regulatory line of sight to what’s expected of them between now and 2030.” “And they can plan, they can price it, they can procure it,” she said. And “they can make investments and gear capital accordingly.” To date, the carbon market has been shaped less by supply-and-demand dynamics that typically steer commodities, and more by policy developments as well as greenwashing shocks. Meanwhile, legal definitions around carbon credits remain inconsistent globally, adding to pricing complications. The risks are significant enough to have left major banks struggling to get a foothold in the market. That’s created opportunities for traders like Trafigura, which is already striking new deals. Earlier this month, it announced an agreement to underwrite $500 million for a new carbon credits project to restore the woodlands of Miombo spanning southern and central Africa. The new regulatory backdrop is “changing the entire paradigm of how markets behave,” Hauman said.

Related: Fed inflation gauge ticked higher in October amid consumer spending boost This is the most important time of the year for retailers, given the spike in consumer spending. Holiday shopping is crucial for the chains' overall sales. The National Retail Federation expects holiday sales to grow between 2.5% and 3.5% from a year earlier, to a total of $980 billion from $955 billion. The forecast includes e-commerce, which is expected to grow 8% to 9%, totaling between $295 billion and $300 billion. 🚨Don’t Miss this amazing Black Friday Move! Get 60% off TheStreet Pro. Act now before it’s gone 😲 “I am optimistic about the pace of economic activity in the final quarter of the year,” Jack Kleinhenz, the trade group's chief economist, said. ""Given third-quarter spending performance and comprehensive upward revisions in late September for income, spending and the savings rate, I have increased confidence in the economy’s strength and the near-term outlook,"" he added. Americans voted to send Donald Trump back to the White House in January. The president-elect wasted no time in rattling a few cages when he vowed to impose a 25% tax on all imports from Mexico and Canada, along with an additional 10% tax on imports from China. Several retailers recently released their quarterly results and investment firms have been adjusting their ratings and stock prices accordingly. Bloomberg/Getty Images Kohl's  (KSS)  started the holidays off on a sour note, as the department-store chain missed Wall Street's fiscal-third-quarter earnings expectations, lowered its full-year guidance and said CEO Tom Kingsbury would step down as of Jan. 15. Kohl’s shares are down 45% this year and off nearly 32% from a year ago. Related: Home Depot stock leaps after Q3 earnings, 2024 forecast Kingsbury spoke bluntly to analysts about the results during the company's earnings call. ""They did not meet our expectations and were frankly disappointing,"" Kingsbury said. ""Sales have been a challenge for us throughout 2024 and weakened further in Q3. Over the last several quarters, we have implemented a significant amount of change across our assortment, value strategies, and in-store experience."" Kingsbury, who was president and CEO of Burlington Stores  (BURL)  from 2008 to 2018, said Kohl's leadership believed these actions would make the company more competitive in the long term, But he added that ""we undervalued the short-term impact this change could have on our sales performance."" ""We are not satisfied with our performance and are taking aggressive action to reverse the sales declines,"" he said. Kingsbury was the company's interim CEO starting in late 2022, succeeding former CEO Michelle Gass, who took the helm at Levi Strauss  (LEVI)  in November 2022. He became permanent CEO in early 2023. Ashley Buchanan will take over as CEO effective Jan.15. Buchanan has been CEO of arts and crafts retailer Michaels since 2020; prior to that post she held senior executive roles at Walmart  (WMT)  and the retail giant's membership warehouse chain Sam's Club during her 13 years at the company. Kingsbury will stay on in an advisory role and remain a director through his retirement in May. Baird downgraded Kohl's to neutral from outperform with a price target of $18, down from $25, according to The Fly. The investment firm said that a number of issues reduce its conviction in the value case for KSS shares: ongoing pressure in Kohl's core apparel and footwear business, implying share losses during the back-to-school period; greater comparables volatility as management iterates on changes to the operating model, and the pending change of CEO. Baird analysts see opportunity for comparisons and margins to stabilize and improve as changes take hold, but with the timeline uncertain amid intense competition, the stock's risk/reward  balance appears even today. Bank of America Securities analyst Lorraine Hutchinson cut the firm's price target on Kohl's to $15 from $18 and affirmed an underperform rating on the shares. Related: Billionaire Bill Ackman makes big bet on major consumer stock The move came after management cut fiscal 2024 guidance for sales, comparable sales, operating margin and EPS to reflect continued challenges in the core business and expectations for a highly competitive holiday. Hutchinson also noted the new CEO announcement and while she says Buchanan's customer-facing expertise from Michaels should provide value, the analyst expects many of Kohl's core challenges to remain. Burlington Stores reported higher sales in the latest quarter and said the holiday selling season has started strong. Total sales increased 11% in the fiscal third quarter on top of 12% sales growth last year, CEO Michael O'Sullivan said. ""The major driver of this growth is our new-store opening program,"" O'Sullivan told analysts. ""We continue to be very pleased with the performance of our new stores, and we are excited by the strength of our new-store pipeline."" The executive said that the company’s back-to-school sales dropped significantly due to temperatures having been much warmer than they were a year earlier. Related: Veteran fund manager issues dire warning on stocks ""Unseasonably warm temperatures do not just impact the [comparable] sales trend for cold-weather merchandise,"" O'Sullivan said. ""They're also a drag on overall traffic coming into the store, which affects every business. Anyway, even leaving aside this additional point, we are very encouraged with our underlying comp sales trend."" B of A's Hutchinson raised the investment firm's price target on Burlington Stores to $350 from $315 and reiterated a buy rating on the shares. Warm weather and hurricanes hurt Q3 comparable sales at Burlington. But the investment firm models fiscal 2024 sales growth of 8%, driven by a 2.5% comparable and an outsized benefit from productive new stores, adding that Burlington has ""outsized sales and margin recovery opportunities.""

More Retail Stocks: Forget Caitlin Clark, Adidas banks on a new basketball phenom Popular handbag brand makes big announcement about future Amazon unveils new service to compete with Temu Even with outsized weather exposure, Burlington stayed within same-store sales guidance and managed the profit and loss statement well. That's despite what Evercore says was ""the biggest intraquarter peak-to-trough same-store-sales deceleration the off-pricers have seen in years"" in Q3. While weather was slightly worse than expected in Q3, the firm said it sees no change to the long-term story and doesn't think comparable sales in a quarter with severe weather headwinds are ""a true indicator of the progress being made to sustain competitive off-price comps and with relatively strong margin performance."" Best Buy  (BBY)  missed Wall Street’s third-quarter revenue expectations and cut its full-year sales forecast. The company’s shares are up nearly 14% year-to-date and up 28% from a year ago. ""Our sales performance was impacted by overall softer-than-forecasted customer demand during September and October,"" CEO Corie Sue Barry told analysts during the company's earnings call. ""We attribute this to a combination of overall ongoing macro uncertainty, customers waiting for deals and sales, and distraction during the runup to the election, particularly in nonessential categories."" Related: Warren Buffett just sold 3 massively popular stocks Barry said the electronics retailer had expected lower demand between sales, ""but the impact was even steeper than we estimated."" ""In the last few weeks, as the holiday sales begun and the election is behind us, we have seen customer demand increase again,"" she said. ""From a category perspective, we drove comparable sales growth in computing, tablets, and services."" Loop Capital analyst Anthony Chukumba lowered the investment firm's price target on Best Buy to $100 from $110 while maintaining a buy rating on the shares. Best Buy's Q3 results came up short of the firm's expectations, driven by a disappointing revenue line, but the analyst said he was encouraged by the strong start to the holiday selling season and says management's Q4 guidance could end up being conservative. At the same time, Chukumba said, Best Buy stock is likely to have a significant overhang until the market receives more clarity on Trump administration tariffs since roughly 60% of the company's costs of goods sold are sourced from China. Cost of goods sold refer to the direct costs of goods a company sells. Truist lowered the firm's price target on Best Buy to $95 from $107 and affirmed a hold rating on the shares. Best Buy's Q3 sales and EPS were modestly below the firm's estimates, but margins were solid, and patterns suggest that consumers continue to seek ""value"" during events with deeper lulls in between, the firm told investors in a research note. While there have been some ""green shoots,"" like positive mid-single-digit-percent comparables in laptops and tablets, and artificial intelligence could provide an incremental lever, natural demand trends have yet to really inflect even after 12 quarters of negative comparables, Truist said.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/black-friday-tech-tips-for-shopping-for-video-games-headphones-tvs-and-more-200609661.html,"Wed, Nov 27, 2024, 12:06 PM","It’s the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, which means you’re either laying the groundwork for how best to avoid awkward conversations tomorrow or prepping your Black Friday shopping list. Or both. My advice for blocking out those cringe-worthy chats is to bury your face in the sweet potatoes and never look up. My advice for shopping for gadgets on Black Friday is a little more helpful. Here are my tips for how to shop for tech products this year, whether you’re prowling the aisles of your favorite store or perusing an app from your couch. Video games, game consoles, and game accessories are an easy score on any Black Friday. You’ll find deals on consoles including Sony’s (SONY) PlayStation 5, Microsoft’s (MSFT) X Box Series X, and Nintendo’s (NTDOY) Switch, not to mention a solid amount off on controllers, which are mighty pricey when not on sale. I’m hoping my wife opts for a new PlayStation 5 controller at $20 off, since ours are always dying. Discounted gaming gift cards are also a great option for Black Friday shopping. Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, Valve’s Steam, Roblox, and others offer gift cards for in-game purchases or to pay for a few months of access to their respective online services. Whether you’re looking for over-the-ear headphones or in-ear earbuds, you can score some exceptional deals during Black Friday. Be on the lookout for Apple’s (AAPL) AirPods and AirPods Pro if you’re an Apple fan, or check out the various offerings from Beats, JBL, Bose, and Sony that will be on sale at different retailers. It’s important to remember that some people are exceedingly particular when it comes to their earbuds. Some prefer those with silicon tips and others can’t stand them. You should also take into account whether you want active noise cancellation (ANC) or not. ANC, as its name implies, actively cancels out background noise while you're listening to music, podcasts, shows, whatever you’re into. You’ll usually only find ANC on more expensive headphones and earbuds. So, if you can find a pair with the technology at a good price, like the Bose QuietComfort for $199 at Amazon, go for it. In the market for a laptop this Black Friday? You’re in luck. Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy, and others are offering up sales on everything from Apple’s MacBooks to ASUS gaming rigs and Microsoft’s Surface laptop. Not every laptop you see on sale is worth buying, though. My advice is to look for a laptop with at least 16GB of RAM. That’s more or less the norm for modern laptops, but lower-cost models often only provide 8GB, which can translate to slower overall performance. Generally, when you’re shopping for a laptop, or desktop for that matter, you want to purchase the most expensive model you can comfortably afford. That’s because pricer models tend to have the latest and greatest chips and more RAM and storage, which means they’ll last longer than more modestly priced computers. TVs are some of the most sought-after Black Friday items. But don’t just settle for the first TV you see at a suspiciously low price. When it comes to TVs, your best bet is to get an OLED model, thanks to their brilliant colors and inky blacks. Unfortunately, OLED TVs are pretty expensive, with most coming in at $1,000 or more. QLED TVs are a great alternative, though you’re not going to get the same kind of color performance as an OLED set. If there’s one thing to remember when buying a TV, though, it’s that you get what you pay for. In other words, if you opt for a $400, 55-inch model, don’t expect it to provide the best picture quality. But if you’re looking for the kind of TV that turns your friends green with envy, like LG’s C3, expect to splash out $1,300. If you’re looking for smartphone and tablet deals on Black Friday, you’re in for a mixed bag. In the market for a new iPhone? Then you’ll generally need to search for trade-in options or sign up for a new mobile plan. Android phones like Samsung’s Galaxy S24 Ultra, however, are on sale at places like Best Buy. Tablets, on the other hand, are great buys during Black Friday, whether they’re from Apple, Samsung, or Amazon. You can often find slates for hundreds of dollars off with a quick online search. Amazon, Roku (ROKU), and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) tend to go all out when it comes to Black Friday sales on their smart speakers and streaming boxes, and this year is no different. Amazon’s Echo Show 8 is $70 off at Best Buy, Roku’s Streaming Stick is $20 off at Amazon, and Google’s Nest Audio speaker is $50 off on the Google Store site. I’ve been holding off on buying a new Roku for my bedroom until Black Friday specifically because the sales are too good to pass up. Email Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

The US president-elect has vowed to impose tariffs on Chinese goods, a move that threatens to devastate trade flows between the world’s largest economies and jeopardize China’s export sector, one of the few pillars of growth this year. “Higher US yields, a stronger dollar, and higher trade tariffs are a challenge for all, but emerging-market equities are relatively cheap compared to their own historical averages and developed-market peers,” said Hasnain Malik, emerging- and frontier-market strategist at Tellimer. “Next year should see simultaneous fiscal stimulus in the US, China, and Japan, and, potentially, an end to wars in Europe and the Middle East.” Elsewhere, Israeli dollar bonds were among the top 20 best performing in emerging and frontier eurobonds in a Bloomberg index.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-labor-board-judge-rules-212509841.html,"Wed, Nov 27, 2024, 1:25 PM","HOUSTON (Reuters) - A U.S. National Labor Relations Board administrative law judge has ruled Exxon Mobil's 10-month-long lockout of some 600 union workers at a Texas oil refinery during a contract dispute was legal. The judge sided with Exxon in his decision on Nov. 21, finding the 2021 and 2022 lockout was to pressure the United Steelworkers union workers toward a deal, not to oust the union from the 369,024 barrel-per-day (bpd) Beaumont, Texas, refinery complex. The USW had faced a decertification campaign and filed an unfair labor practice complaint during the lockout, alleging an improper effort to break the plant's union. The union had sought millions of dollars in lost pay and benefits for the workers who were locked out of the plant between May 2021 and March 2022. ""There is little or no evidence that the company locked out the unit employees to unlawfully pressure them to decertify the union,” NLRB law judge Jeffrey Wedekind said in an opinion accompanying the decision. A spokesperson for Exxon did not reply to a request for comment. Meekie Moseley, president of USW Local 13-243, which represents the workers, said the union is considering its options following the judge's decision. The USW can appeal the decision to the NLRB. “We believe the decision does not reflect the facts of the case,” Moseley said in a statement. Wedekind's decision came 18 months after hearings began in the case. Those hearings considered whether internal Exxon documents involving negotiating strategy, and a post-contract review could be considered in the case. But Wedekind excluded the documents, some of which showed Exxon managers early on had weighed a lockout and debated what it would take for union members to vote to decertify, or formally remove, the union. In documents viewed by Reuters, Exxon managers had early on considered using a lockout and later felt that changes in the makeup of the workforce would benefit the company's strategy in future talks. A fifth of the workers initially locked out on May 1, 2021, had left the company prior to the contract settlement in March 2022. The replacements “previously worked as contractors for the duration of the lockout – benefits both site performance and long-term labor strategy,” wrote a plant manager Jose Diaz, according to the documents that were posted on an internal website and leaked to the USW, according to hearing testimony. Another document had raised the prospect of getting workers to push out the union during the next round of negotiations in 2027 by dividing the contract between the complex's refinery and the lube oil plant. ""Split the contract in 2027, and the refinery will decertify eventually,"" former plant manager Jonathan Parsons said, according to the documents.

(AP) — Three people were killed and one seriously injured early Wednesday when a Tesla Cybertruck crashed and caught fire in Northern California, officials said. Piedmont Police Chief Jeremy Bowers said speed was likely a factor in the single-vehicle collision, but he added that authorities would continue to investigate the circumstances of the tragedy. The Cybertruck's occupants had been driving back from a “function” around 3:10 a.m. Wednesday, but Bowers would not give additional details. Someone who also had been at the function, but was driving in a separate car, was able to pull the surviving victim out of the Cybertruck. The chief would not release any identifying details of the victims, citing family privacy. Although the police officers who responded were unable to douse the flames with their fire extinguishers, the fire department put the blaze out quickly. Piedmont Fire Chief Dave Brannigan said the speed in extinguishing the flames meant it was unlikely that the Cybertruck's large lithium-ion battery had caught fire. He called the incident “more along the lines of a typical car fire.” Bowers, addressing a question about recent Cybertruck recalls, said “there’s no indication that there were mechanical effects that were the primary cause for the collision.” The Cybertruck, which has been on sale for about a year, has been recalled six times for safety problems, most recently on Nov. 5 because a fault in an electric inverter can cause the drive wheels to lose power. Other recalls covered rearview camera images that don’t activate immediately after shifting into reverse, trim pieces that can fall off, windshield wipers that can fail, and an incorrect font size on instrument panel warning lights.

Brent advanced to top $73. While Israel started a cease-fire with the Iran-backed militant group on Tuesday, hawkish comments from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu raised uncertainty that an end to fighting will endure. At the same time, OPEC+ talks to delay a production restart have begun ahead of a meeting this weekend, allaying concerns over a supply glut. Prices moves were exacerbated by thin pre-holiday trading, with open interest hovering near monthly lows. Oil options markets have begun pricing in a lower risk of escalation in the Middle East, and hundreds of thousands of bullish calls expired worthless on Tuesday. Crude has been stuck in a tight range since the beginning of last month, buffeted by competing bullish and bearish signals. A number of catalysts may drive the market’s next move, including the policies of a second Trump presidency, geopolitical risks linked to Russian and Iranian supplies next year and OPEC+’s output plans. “On one hand, OPEC+ appears to be reluctant to unwind, given concerns over weak oil demand and market consensus that 2025 looks like a surplus year for oil balances,” Citigroup Inc. analysts including Eric Lee wrote in a note. “On the other hand, deeper cuts also seem unlikely, with prices still above $70 Brent, global observable oil inventories relatively low, and some geopolitical risk still in the market.” The American Petroleum Institute reported US crude inventories shrank by 5.9 million barrels last week, which would be the biggest drop since August if confirmed by government figures later Wednesday.

Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Italy’s Motor City, Car-Free Options Are Growing In Traffic-Weary Toronto, a Battle Breaks Out Over Bike Lanes In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field Google said in a filing Wednesday that US District Judge James Donato’s ruling is flawed and asked that the outcome of the long-running litigation be set aside. For one thing, Google argued, Donato should have recognized that the company competes with Apple Inc. in the smartphone market, as a different judge found when she concluded that Apple’s conduct toward Epic didn’t violate federal antitrust laws. The judge also erred in holding a trial with a jury last year instead of deciding himself whether Google acted anticompetitively, the company said. Google says Donato’s ruling would force it to do business with rival app stores — which the company contends it is not legally required to do. A San Francisco jury concluded in December 2023 that Google violated antitrust law by blocking rival app stores through a series of revenue-sharing agreements with mobile device makers like Samsung. Following up with a fix in October, Donato ordered Google to allow developers to set up app marketplaces and offer consumers billing options other than its own payment system. “This case involves an extraordinary attempt by a lone competitor to use the federal judiciary to restructure the day-to-day operations of Google’s app store, Google Play, and to unilaterally reshape markets with consequences for millions of non-parties,”Google said in its filing. Donato’s injunction and liability ruling, unless reversed, “will directly undercut Google’s efforts” to compete against Apple, Google said. Epic first sued Google and Apple in August 2020, accusing them of blocking competition for rival app stores. The judge in the Apple case largely ruled against Epic, though she directed the iPhone maker to make some changes to its App Store rules. Epic and Apple are currently fighting in an Oakland federal court over whether the iPhone maker is abiding by that ruling. Donato has temporarily put his ruling on hold. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco can extend that delay pending the outcome of Google’s appeal, or force Google to make changes to its business while simultaneously seeking to overturn the ruling. Oral arguments are scheduled on Feb. 3 at the Ninth Circuit.

Fiber-optic cables linking Germany to Finland and Lithuania to Sweden were damaged Nov. 17-18. Analysis of ship tracking data by news organizations placed the bulk vessel Yi Peng in the area at that time. Last week Germany, Lithuania and Sweden opened criminal investigations into the Hong Kong-flagged ship, which departed the Russian port of Ust-Luga on Nov. 15. Naval  and coast guard vessels from Sweden, Germany and Denmark have at different times surrounded the 735-foot vessel, which is idling in international waters but within the Danish exclusive economic zone. At a regular news briefing Wednesday, a spokesman for China expressed support for cooperation with other countries to ensure the security of international undersea cables. As many as 200 such infrastructure breaches occur each year, nearly all by accident. The U.S. Navy termed both incidents as accidents, the report said, but other countries would not rule out intent given heightened geopolitical tensions. Swedish officials said they have been in contact with the ship and China, and have asked the vessel to return to Swedish waters as part of the investigation, Reuters reported. Denmark is also in talks with China, according to French media. In October 2023, the Chinese container ship Newnew Polar Bear damaged a Baltic gas pipeline and cables.

Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, who took over market research for the firm this summer, released a year-end 2025 target of 6,500, which eclipses the average projection of about 6,300 among strategists tracked by Bloomberg. “Heightened geopolitical uncertainty and the evolving policy agenda are introducing unusual complexity to the outlook, but opportunities are likely to outweigh risks,” he wrote. US stocks have extended their outperformance against international peers this year, powered by tech shares and the artificial intelligence frenzy, while the economy remains resilient. The S&P 500 has climbed about 25% in 2024, making numerous record highs and largely outpacing the MSCI World Ex-USA Index. The valuation gap has also widened, with US stocks now trading at a record 60% premium to international peers based on forward price-to-earnings ratios. While the stock market is taking a breather after the S&P 500 notched its 52nd record of the year, seasonal trends suggest the momentum could continue. Since 1950, the gauge has generated an average gain of 1.8% from Thanksgiving through year-end and finished higher about 70% of the time over this period, according to Adam Turnquist at LPL Financial. This compares to the broader market’s average gain of 1.0% and positivity rate of 63% during all six-week periods since 1950. When the index is higher on the year into the holiday, the average gain into year-end bumps up to 2.1%, with 75% of occurrences yielding positive results, he noted. Inflows into US equities surged after the election and a retail frenzy is back, while selling of Europe continues unabated, according to Barclays Plc’s Emmanuel Cau. The strategist still sees some dry powder as despite big US inflows from long-only funds and retail, there was limited re-grossing by hedge funds and systematic strategies. He says sentiment indicators haven’t rebounded with the overall market, suggesting bullishness is not as widespread as it seems.

(AP) — Two tax preparers submitted $65 million in false claims for refunds under programs designed to help businesses during the COVID-19 pandemic, federal prosecutors in Tennessee said Wednesday. A federal grand jury indicted Renata Walton, 44, and Nicole Jones, 36, on more than 50 counts of wire fraud, money laundering, preparing false tax returns and obstruction of justice, the U.S. attorney's office in Memphis said in a news release. Walton and Jones, of Olive Branch, Mississippi, pleaded not guilty on Tuesday and were each released on $100,000 bond. Court records do not list lawyers for them, and their tax preparation business is closed “for the season,” according to a phone message at the number for R&B Tax Express in Moscow, Tennessee. Prosecutors said Walton and Jones filed for tax credits for their clients under the Employee Retention Credit and the Sick and Family Leave Credit, but their clients were not entitled to them. The clients received six-figure tax refunds, and they paid Walton and Jones large fees that they laundered through local banks, the indictment said. The Employee Retention Credit is a refundable tax credit for certain eligible businesses and organizations that had employees and were affected during the pandemic. The Sick and Family Leave Credit provided tax credits to employers for wages paid for leave taken by workers who needed to recover from injury, disability, illness or conditions related to vaccinations. Walton is also charged with submitting false Paycheck Protection Program and Economic Injury Disaster Loan applications to the Small Business Administration. “In total, Walton and Jones filed fraudulent claims seeking over $65 million dollars,” the news release said. Both tax preparers were “put on notice” that the federal government was investigating them, but they continued to file false returns, the indictment said. Walton also encouraged her tax clients not to speak with Internal Revenue Service agents, the indictment said.

Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Italy’s Motor City, Car-Free Options Are Growing In Traffic-Weary Toronto, a Battle Breaks Out Over Bike Lanes In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field Trump, a longtime skeptic of continued US assistance to Ukraine, has vowed to settle its conflict with Russia before even taking office. In writings over the last year, Kellogg has proposed a path forward that offers an indication of how Trump might try to fulfill that promise. “Keith has led a distinguished Military and Business career, including serving in highly sensitive National Security roles in my first Administration,” Trump said in a post to his Truth Social account on Wednesday. “He was with me right from the beginning! Together, we will secure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH, and Make America, and the World, SAFE AGAIN!” Kellogg, 80, was Vice President Mike Pence’s national security adviser and later joined Trump’s team during his first term. He has called for compelling Ukraine to enter talks with Russia by threatening to cut off arms supplies. But he’s also suggested keeping up support if Ukraine pursues diplomacy so it can negotiate from a position of strength. He also envisions a potential deal that would freeze the current front line and create a demilitarized zone and put off the issue of NATO membership for Ukraine “for an extended period,” according to a piece he co-wrote for the America First Policy Institute, a group founded by several former Trump administration officials. He cited a Foreign Affairs article that proposed offering the Kremlin “some limited sanctions relief.” “The war in Ukraine is an avoidable tragedy that resulted from President Biden’s incompetence as a world leader and his chaotic foreign policy,” Kellogg wrote with Fred Fleitz, who also served in Trump’s first administration. President Joe Biden has recently sought to ramp up assistance for Ukraine, including by allowing Kyiv to strike military targets deeper within Russia, approving the sending of anti-personnel land mines and forgiving nearly $5 billion in debt. His administration has also called on Ukraine to lower its draft age, citing concerns that its biggest need now is manpower, not weapons. By potentially putting Ukraine in a better negotiating position, Biden administration officials have argued that their last-minute push dovetails with the Trump camp’s calls for a faster settlement. Last week, Kellogg praised Biden’s decision to allow Ukraine to fire US-made ATACMS missiles inside Russia. “He’s actually given President Trump more leverage,” Kellogg said of Biden on Fox News. At the same time, he criticized the administration for not allowing the missiles to be used in Russia earlier. Kellogg was a behind-the-scenes player in Trump’s first presidential transition, eventually landing the unheralded role of executive secretary and chief of staff to the National Security Council. Kellogg was a consistent and loyal presence on the White House national security team, even as he saw a succession of top advisers come and go. Kellogg didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment sent to the America First Policy Institute and the Trump transition team. While at the institute, Kellogg helped write An America First Approach to U.S. National Security, a book of essays that included the chapter on Ukraine. It argued that the US should seek an end to Russia’s war against Ukraine though “bold diplomacy.” “What we should not continue to do is to send arms to a stalemate that Ukraine will eventually find difficult to win,” he and Fleitz wrote. Trump spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy earlier this month after the election. The Kremlin has denied a report that Trump and Putin spoke by phone days after the election. Kellogg’s military experience dates to the Vietnam War, where he won several awards for valor.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sensitive-dot-documents-found-vulnerable-204804921.html,"Wed, Nov 27, 2024, 12:48 PM","WASHINGTON — Vulnerability tests conducted at the U.S. Department of Transportation revealed that employees’ personal information and other sensitive documents are at risk because of ineffective IT safeguards, according to a federal watchdog. By using publicly available administrator account credentials, auditors at the department’s Office of Inspector General were able to gain unauthorized access to printers used by employees at DOT’s Federal Highway Administration, according to OIG’s report published on Wednesday. That access allowed investigators to see all kinds of personal information that employees had previously printed, scanned or faxed, including marriage licenses, medical billings and prescriptions, employee last wills and testaments, tax documents, bank account statements, home addresses, and Social Security numbers. As part of its testing of uncredentialed access, the OIG also found that no authentication had been required from an unsecured conference room, which “allowed us to traverse from the FHWA intranet to the FAA intranet,” the agency stated in the report. “We then gained unauthorized access to FAA systems that were supposed to have restricted access to only authorized FAA personnel, containing sensitive documents as well as documents with proprietary data not authorized for other government agencies or vendors.” Those documents included airport maintenance logs, detailed future maintenance plans, VIP passenger lists and editable flight logs. “We also accessed an FAA National Operation Control Center application and an FAA engineering drawing site containing third-party proprietary contractor drawings and designs as well as military drawings and schematics. “Lastly, we accessed an aviation search tool containing global airports, heliports, and a tactical airstrip classified under a pseudonym within the FAA’s National Maintenance Alert System.” The audit, conducted between November 2021 and August 2024, identified thousands of individual vulnerabilities at FHWA that were more than a year old and not remediated within specified timelines required by DOT. Among them, the OIG found: 541 critical vulnerabilities, 80% of which had not been remediated within 30 days of identification. 1,366 high vulnerabilities, 91% of which had not been remediated within 30 days of identification. 4,755 medium vulnerabilities, 99% of which had not been remediated within 60 days of identification.

To emphasize its broader view of the business, Zoom announced Monday that it has dropped “video” from its official name and would now be known as Zoom Communications Inc. “Our new name more accurately reflects our expanding scope and plans for long-term growth,” Chief Executive Officer Eric Yuan wrote in a post announcing the change. Those new businesses are finding an audience, executives said, but added that the outlook for 2.7% sales growth in the current quarter may continue at the same pace into early 2025. Investors were looking for more, wrote Michael Funk, an analyst at Bank of America. “We question if the commentary is simply setting a low bar for new CFO Michelle Chang,” Funk wrote. In October, Zoom named Chang, a former Microsoft Corp. executive, as chief financial officer to replace Kelly Steckelberg, who left to join closely held design firm Canva Inc. The shares declined 6.7% to $83.08 at 12:43 p.m. Tuesday in New York, the biggest intraday slide since May 2023. While Zoom’s forecast met estimates, the stock had gained 48% since the company’s last earnings report in August through Monday’s close on optimism about the new products. Revenue will be about $1.18 billion in the period ending in January, Zoom said Monday in a statement. Profit, excluding some items, will be $1.29 to $1.30 a share. Analysts, on average, projected adjusted earnings of $1.28 a share on sales of $1.17 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Zoom has seen a 59% increase in monthly active users of its AI assistant since the prior quarter, the company said in a presentation to supplement its earnings statement. It also topped 1,250 customers of its contact center application. While there were “no major issues” with the results, the steep gain for the shares headed into the earnings meant the results might not attract new investors, wrote Tyler Radke, an analyst at Citigroup. In the fiscal third quarter, sales increased 3.6% to $1.18 billion, compared with analysts’ average estimate of $1.16 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Profit, excluding some items, was $1.38 a share in the period ended Oct. 31. Enterprise revenue increased 5.8% to $699 million. Zoom said it had 3,995 customers who contributed more than $100,000 over the past year. An ongoing loss of consumers and small businesses from Zoom has concerned investors, particularly since these customers are typically higher-margin than corporate clients. Average monthly churn in this segment was 2.7% in the quarter, which was better than analysts’ estimates. Sales in the segment was little changed at $479 million. That was Zoom’s lowest-ever online churn, Chang said, according to remarks prepared for the company’s earnings conference call. Zoom said it’s adding $1.2 billion to its existing share buyback program, raising the total repurchase authorization to $2 billion.

Young Liu, chairman of the contract manufacturer and key Apple supplier, told reporters after a forum in Taipei that it saw the primary impact of any fresh tariffs falling on its clients because its business model was based on contract manufacturing. ""Clients may decide to shift production locations, but looking at Foxconn’s global footprint, we are ahead. As a result, the impact on us is likely smaller compared to our competitors,"" he said. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Monday that on his first day in office he will impose a 25% tariff on all products from Mexico and Canada, and will charge goods from China an additional 10% tariff. Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker, has large manufacturing facilities in China including a giant iPhone assembly plant. However, it has been increasing its investments in other countries such as the United States, Mexico, and Vietnam as part of a supply chain diversification effort. In Mexico, it is building a large manufacturing facility to produce Nvidia’s GB200 AI servers. Liu said Foxconn would only be able to share more details about the company's U.S. plans after Jan. 20, once Trump takes office and his policies and tariff changes become clearer. ""After that, we will have a corresponding strategy in place,” he said. “What you’re seeing now is a game between nations, not yet between companies. Whether it’s 25% or an additional 10%, the outcome is uncertain as they continue to negotiate. We are constantly adapting and refining our global strategy.” During Trump's 2017-2021 presidency, Foxconn announced a $10 billion investment in Wisconsin that the company later mostly abandoned. On Tuesday, Foxconn said a subsidiary had spent $33 million to acquire land and factory buildings in Harris County, Texas. Foxconn will continue investing in Mexico, Liu added as it believed the trend was moving towards regional manufacturing. Mexico, with over 100 million people and its proximity to the South American market, presented a significant opportunity, he added.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/factbox-trumps-proposed-tariffs-might-005925629.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 4:59 PM","(Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump on Monday pledged tariffs on the United States' three largest trading partners - Canada, Mexico and China. The proposed tariffs would affect a wide range of industries, including oil, natural gas, agriculture and manufacturing, potentially altering long-established trade patterns and supply chains. Here are commodities and energy sectors which may be affected: OIL Canada exported some $177.19 billion in energy products to the United States in 2023, according to government data. Crude imports from Canada make up more than a fifth of all the oil that U.S. refineries process. About 70% of imported Canadian barrels go to Midwest U.S. refiners that supply an area that includes Chicago and Detroit. Many of those Midwest refiners are configured to run heavier oil and would either struggle to find a direct replacement for Canadian oil or face paying a higher price if that oil is subject to tariffs. That could drive up fuel costs in the Midwest. The U.S. imported about 5.2 million barrels of crude and petroleum products per day (bpd) from Canada and Mexico in 2024, with more than 4 million bpd of that from Canada, data from the U.S. Department of Energy showed. In 2023, Canadian crude oil exports to the United States were above $110 billion, according to the Canada Energy Regulator. GAS The U.S. imported about 8.5 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of natural gas during the first eight months of 2024 from Canada and Mexico, according to the latest data available from the EIA. Total natural gas exports were about $6 billion in 2023, according to data from the Canada Energy Regulator. Most of this year's gas imports - about 8.4 bcfd - came via pipelines from Canada. That compares with an annual average of 8.0 bcfd of gas imports from Canada in 2023 and an average of 7.6 bcfd over the past five years (2018-2022). The remaining roughly 0.1 bcfd of gas imports so far this year came from pipelines from Mexico, liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Canada and Trinidad and Tobago, and compressed natural gas (CNG) from Canada. The U.S., meanwhile, exported about 20.8 bcfd of gas during the first eight months of 2024, including about 2.7 bcfd going to Canada via pipeline, 6.4 bcfd going to Mexico via pipeline and roughly 11.7 bcfd going to various countries via LNG, according to the EIA. The value of those U.S. gas exports during the first eight months was around $11.0 billion, according to Reuters calculations using the U.S. Henry Hub benchmark as the spot price of the gas. AGRICULTURE The U.S. imported $40.1 billion of Canadian agricultural products last year, making Canada the second-largest origin of U.S. agricultural imports behind Mexico, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The United States imported nearly $3 billion of Canadian beef last year, $1.1 billion of pork and another $2 billion of live animals as part of an integrated, cross-border livestock producing and processing industry. Canada also supplies the United States with nearly half of its imports of vegetable oils and lumber and other forest products. In 2023, the U.S. imported $45.4 billion of agricultural products from Mexico. About two-thirds of all U.S. vegetable imports and half of fruit and nut imports come from Mexico, according to the USDA: nearly 90% of its avocados, as much as 35% of its orange juice, and 20% of its strawberries. U.S. imports of Mexican tequila and mezcal - both used for making cocktails, such as margaritas - totaled $4.66 billion in 2023, up 160% since 2019. Each year, Mexico exports more than 1 million cows across the border to become part of the U.S. beef supply. SUGAR The U.S. imported 521,000 short tons of sugar from Mexico in the 2023/24 season (Oct-Sept), under a bilateral trade deal that reduces the import taxes on sugar from Mexico. It was nearly 15% of all U.S. sugar imports of 3.76 million short tons in the last season. POTASH The U.S. imported about 13 million tons of potash last year, of which 85% came from Canada, according to data from the USDA.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bluesky-verification-could-look-lot-183848606.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 10:38 AM","The rapidly growing social networking startup Bluesky, a Twitter/X alternative built on open web principles, revealed in a livestream on Monday how its approach to user account verification will differ from existing services, like Meta and X. While traditional social media has shifted to a pay-for-verification model, where users pay for the privilege of the blue check that confirms their identity, Bluesky envisions a system where multiple verification providers exist to serve the needs of its broader community. Currently, the only way to verify your account on Bluesky is to adopt a custom domain name, something the company began offering an option last year. That's how you know that the account @nytimes.com on Bluesky belongs to the real The New York Times publication, for example. In addition, Bluesky tackles impersonation issues directly, as they arise. However, Bluesky believes that custom domains may only be part of the solution around verification going forward. In the future, the company is considering a model where multiple verification providers co-exist. Explained Bluesky CEO Jay Graber, ""...we could be a verification provider — and we might at some point (and also, no, I'm not sure when). But it would be something where you're accessing through one app, and then there might be another app and there might be other services,"" she continued. ""And they can choose to trust us — the Bluesky team's verification — or they could do their own. Or other people could do their own."" Or, in other words, Bluesky is proposing a verification system where one entity — the company itself, that is — is not in singular control over who gets the ""verified"" label and who does not. This is a rethinking of verification compared with how such systems have traditionally worked and how they have more recently evolved. On Twitter, verification has been fraught with complications and concerns over the years. Originally, Twitter would verify some high-profile users but ignore others who believed they deserved verification, too, creating a two-tier class system of sorts. Under new owner Elon Musk, the company attempted to overhaul this system to make it more democratic by allowing anyone to pay to verify themselves. But, as you may expect, this dramatic switch did not go well, as users bought verification checks in order to impersonate others on the platform, causing chaos. Even today, X continues to have a problem with bots that are verified, which has devalued what a verified check means. Meta, meanwhile, followed Twitter/X with paid verification that serves mainly to assist creators and businesses on its platform. Bluesky, on the other hand, aims to build infrastructure that would allow anyone to verify others according to their own rules and policies, similar to how it today lets anyone build their own feeds, moderation systems, and algorithms. While Bluesky itself could choose to focus on verifying high-profile users, others could build verification systems that would vet people for other criteria. For example, Graber suggested that a university could verify users as alums, or a fan group like the Swifties could verify people as community members. These verification providers could choose to be selective in terms of who gets verified, or they could offer more comprehensive services, where verification across a range of different affiliations is a part of their offerings. The challenge, the CEO said, would be in how to present multiple verifications to the end user so it wouldn't be confusing. The company needs to figure out how these verifications would appear — as badges, perhaps? — and whether other third-party Bluesky apps would need to display them in the same way as the company's official client. ""...We're trying to design long-term for more applications [and] more services, beyond our own, to operate,"" noted Graber. Timing is another question.

Since the election, Bluesky has added 8.7 million new users and today has topped 22.7 million total users, leaving Meta's X competitor Threads scrambling to counter the threat with its own set of Bluesky-like features, like switching your default feed alongside an update to its algorithm. On the livestream, Bluesky's team talked about other long-term plans, like how Bluesky profiles could be designed to connect users to their broader web presence, including their personal website and other social accounts, similar to something like Linktree.

Two sources familiar with Trump's plan told Reuters that oil would not be exempted from potential tariff hikes on imports from Canada and Mexico, despite the U.S. oil industry's warnings that the policy could hurt consumers, industry and national security. The United States accounts for 61% and 56% of crude exports from Canada and Mexico, respectively, ship tracking data from Kpler showed. Canadian crude exports have jumped 65% to about 530,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2024, the data showed, after the opening of the expanded Trans-Mountain pipeline increased shipments to the U.S. and Asia. ""The Canadian producers, if they face export constraints, if they're not able to re-route their barrels that previously were exported to U.S. to other markets, may face deeper discounts and may also suffer some revenue losses,"" Daan Struyven, co-head of global commodities research at Goldman Sachs said. Canada and Mexico export mainly heavy high-sulphur crude that is processed by complex refineries in the U.S. and most of Asia. ""The impact is all on the heavy grades. What are the U.S. refiners going to do? Even Saudi Arabian Heavy crude is limited,"" a Singapore-based trader said, adding that some U.S. refiners can only receive crude via pipelines, limiting their options for imports. ""Either the producer or the refiner will have to absorb the tariffs,"" he said, adding that Canadian producers will have to discount their oil more to attract demand from Asian refiners and cover long-distance shipping costs. Refining sources in Asia and analysts said they expect to see more Canadian and Mexican oil heading to Asia if Trump imposes the tariffs. ""We are likely to see quite some volume going to China and India, where refiners' configurations are able to refine the crude,” said LSEG analyst Anh Pham. TMX exports to Asia have risen in recent months as Asian refiners led by Chinese processors test the new grades. However, Mexican exports are down 21% to about 860,000 bpd this year. European refiners are less likely to pounce on cheaper Mexican and Canadian cargoes, Energy Aspects analyst Christopher Haines told Reuters. Tariffs on Mexico ""would potentially free up some crude for Spanish refiners that take Maya, but Asia could easily absorb any volumes not sold into the U.S. Gulf, so there will be competition,"" he said, adding that European refiners typically don't import much Canadian crude. Exports of Mexican crude to Europe have averaged around 191,000 bpd so far this year, 81% of which was delivered to Spain, according to Kpler. Canadian flows are lower at 85,000 bpd. Still, some traders and Goldman Sachs analysts remain sceptical that Trump would actually impose the tariffs, which he has previously used as a negotiating tool, as doing so would drive inflation for U.S. consumers and refiners.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intel-secures-7-9-billion-100000010.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 3:42 AM","(Bloomberg) -- The Biden administration has finalized a deal to give Intel Corp. nearly $7.9 billion in federal grants, the largest direct subsidy from a program to boost domestic semiconductor manufacturing. Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Italy’s Motor City, Car-Free Options Are Growing In Traffic-Weary Toronto, a Battle Breaks Out Over Bike Lanes In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field The agreement for the struggling chipmaker, smaller than an earlier proposed award, means that Intel can begin receiving funds as it hits negotiated benchmarks on projects in four US states. The company will qualify for at least $1 billion this year, a senior administration official said, based on milestones it has already reached. Specifically, Intel will get money for projects in Arizona, Oregon and New Mexico, according to a person familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named as the details are not public. The company’s greenfield site in Ohio, which has been delayed by several years, is not yet eligible for any federal support, the person said, though it has already received $2 billion from the state. Wrapping up talks has been a top priority for Intel, which has spent months trying to convince Wall Street and Washington that it can execute on a massive manufacturing expansion despite deep financial struggles and years of technological blunders. It’s also an important step for President Joe Biden’s administration, which is trying to insulate its industrial policy initiatives from potential changes under President-elect Donald Trump. Intel’s award will result in “American-designed chips being manufactured and packaged by American workers, in the United States, by an American company, for the first time in a very long time,” said Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, whose agency is in charge of implementing the 2022 Chips and Science Act. The landmark bipartisan law set aside $39 billion in grants, $75 billion in loans and loan guarantees, and 25% tax credits to revitalize American chipmaking. Trump has criticized the chips program as “so bad” and Republican colleagues have threatened to revise — or even repeal — the legislation. The risk that the new administration could overhaul the effort after they take office in January prompted the Commerce Department to accelerate their work, seeking to wrap up as much of the negotiations with Intel, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and other companies as soon as possible. Biden officials have staked a significant portion of their semiconductor ambitions on Intel, the lone American maker of advanced processors. The company has promised to spend $100 billion on US factories — amounting to nearly a quarter of the total private investment spurred by the Chips Act — and is supposed to make semiconductors for the military. That makes Intel’s projects crucial for national security and the country’s broader goal of reaching 20% global market share for leading-edge logic chips. But US officials have also had to contend with Intel’s significant business challenges, which have only grown more apparent since it announced a preliminary award in March. Intel’s disastrous August financial report stoked concern among investors about the viability of Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger’s turnaround plans. Government negotiations stalled over disagreements about how much information Intel would have to share with federal officials seeking to vet its technology road map, Bloomberg has reported, as well as terms spelling out what happens if the company spins off its manufacturing business or is purchased in part or in whole. Reduced grant, no loans Intel was originally in line to win $8.5 billion in Chips Act grants and $11 billion in loans. The final deal has a reduced grant and Intel chose not to take any loans, the senior official said, without elaborating on the reasons why. The funding cut is not because of Intel’s broader business challenges, they said. Rather, it reflects a separate $3 billion grant for Intel to make advanced chips for the military, according to the administration official and several other people familiar with the talks. That program, called Secure Enclave, was originally supposed to get the majority of its funding from the Pentagon. But in February, Defense officials pulled out of their share of the deal, and lawmakers then saddled the Commerce Department with the responsibility. Commerce officials folded some of their new obligations into Chips Act money already set aside for Intel, Bloomberg has reported, reducing the total amount of funding the chipmaker ultimately received. Project delays Intel’s initial proposed award was slated to support all of its US projects. But the company has since delayed construction at key sites, meaning that around 10% of Intel’s total planned capital expenditure falls after 2030 — which is the deadline to receive government support. In Ohio, where construction was originally supposed to finish in late 2026, Intel now plans to complete its first factory by the end of the decade, and the second not until after 2030. That means that the chipmaker’s final award will only support the first Ohio plant, according to the administration official and another person familiar with the matter. Intel’s Arizona site is also slightly delayed. Production there, originally expected to begin by the end of this year, will now start in 2025, the senior official said. The company has already completed construction at an advanced packaging plant in New Mexico, and made investments in a research and development facility in Oregon. All told, Intel has spent $30 billion on its US buildout, on which Gelsinger has hinged an ambitious corporate comeback.

""AI is a robust opportunity … and interest in our portfolio is [at] an all-time high with no signs of slowing down,"" Dell COO Jeffrey Clarke said during a call with investors Tuesday night. ""That said, this business will not be linear, especially as customers navigate an underlying silicon road map that is changing."" Dell's AI server revenues fell 9% in the third quarter from the prior period. On top of a broader slump in the market for personal computers, that nonlinear growth in the AI space contributed to Dell's lower full-year outlook for its fiscal year 2025 ending in February. The midpoint of the company’s guidance range for annual revenue fell to $96.1 billion from $97 billion since last quarter, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi noted on the earnings call. The company said it will provide a formal fiscal 2026 outlook for investors early next year. Even with Wednesday's decline, Dell stock is still up over 65% this year. On the call, Clarke mostly cited a slower-than-expected recovery in the PC market when asked about Dell's lower guidance, but he also pointed to customers' shifting trends toward the newest AI chips. Clarke said Dell’s consumers are looking to use Nvidia’s (NVDA) latest Blackwell AI chips in Dell's servers and those chips have faced some delays. Last week, Nvidia said ""production is in full steam"" for these chips. ""We saw in Q3 a shift and a pretty rapid shift of the orders moving towards our Blackwell design,"" said Clarke, noting that orders for its servers with the Blackwell design make up ""a significant portion"" of its backlog. Traditionally a PC company, Dell's expansion into IT products in the 2010s has paid off during the AI boom. Its servers equipped with Nvidia AI chips are used by companies including Elon Musk’s xAI and the $23 billion cloud provider CoreWeave as part of the crucial hardware used to run generative artificial intelligence software. TD Cowen analyst Krish Sankar noted that Dell's fall in AI server revenue in the most recent quarter was ""mostly due to the well-understood Blackwell pushouts."" Sankar added that Dell's rising backlog and orders of AI servers worth an estimated $8 billion for the third quarter ""are a better representation of actual demand,"" noting Dell's AI pipeline ""now stands slightly below $20B."" Dell CEO Michael Dell said on Nov. 17 that the company had officially shipped its first PowerEdge server using Nvidia's Blackwell AI chips. ""We were the first to ship a GB200 design [a server using Nvidia’s most advanced Blackwell configuration] in the marketplace,"" Clarke said on the call. ""Blackwell is in production. It will continue to ramp and we'll be ready."" Overall, Dell’s third quarter results for the three months ended Nov. 1 were mixed.

Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Italy’s Motor City, Car-Free Options Are Growing In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field The German firm now plans to sell a 20% stake in Talabat, up from 15%, it said in a statement on Wednesday. The deal is set to price at the 1.60 dirhams ($0.44) per share, the top end of a range that started at 1.50 dirhams, according to terms seen by Bloomberg News. That would imply a market capitalization for Talabat of about $10.2 billion. Emirates NBD, one of the banks on the IPO, previously said that Talabat could be valued at up to $14.4 billion, while Bloomberg Intelligence estimated an enterprise value of as much as $12 billion. Delivery Hero shares were up 2% in Germany, valuing the firm at about $11.9 billion. The company “may be building a war chest to pull the M&A trigger in other geographies of its portfolio, such as Asia and LatAm,” said Clément Genelot, an analyst at Bryan, Garnier & Co. Talabat had demand for all shares minutes after subscriptions opened earlier this month, in another sign of robust demand for regional deals. It’s the latest in a slew of initial share sales in the Middle East, which have raised close to $11 billion so far this year. Hypermarket chain Lulu Retail raised $1.7 billion in an Abu Dhabi offering last month, shortly after a $2 billion IPO from a unit of Oman’s state energy company. Those deals had disappointing starts — Lulu ended the day flat, and the Omani firm closed 8% below its offer price. Talabat operates across eight countries - UAE, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Egypt, Jordan, Iraq and Bahrain. It has cemented its position in the region helped by Delivery Hero’s acquisition of Indian firm Zomato’s food delivery business in the UAE in 2019 and online grocery platform InstaShop in 2020. Emirates NBD Capital PSC, JPMorgan Securities and Morgan Stanley have been appointed as joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners on the Talabat offering.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lidar-maker-hesai-sees-technology-023504385.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 11:38 PM","(Bloomberg) -- China’s Hesai Group, the world’s largest maker of lidar sensors used in driver assistance systems, is on a growth trajectory that won’t be stopped by geopolitics, according to Chief Executive Officer David Li. Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Italy’s Motor City, Car-Free Options Are Growing In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field The Nasdaq-listed company’s shares surged a record 44% in New York trading on Tuesday after it reported a 21% jump in third-quarter revenue to $76.9 million and forecast further growth to $100 million this quarter. Shipments more than doubled from a year earlier, and Li said that growth will continue, with deliveries expected to rise to 1 million units in 2025. Founded in 2014, Hesai has grown rapidly to become the world’s largest supplier of lidars — short for light detection and ranging — a remote sensing technology that helps vehicles navigate their surroundings. The company commands about 37% of the global market and listed on the Nasdaq in 2023. “Lidar is like the eyes of the autonomous vehicle,” Li said in interview with Bloomberg Television on Wednesday. “It’s a life-saving device.” Hesai is poised to benefit even more from the fast development of advanced driving-assistance systems, a technology that Tesla Inc. and Chinese automakers see as the future of mobility. While Tesla Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk has repeatedly dismissed lidar technology in preference of real-time cameras and AI, many in the auto industry see lidar as improving the safety of autonomous cars. For example, Li said, the sensors can scan the road for problems and activate a car’s brakes or airbags before a driver is even aware of an issue. “It’s enormously important to bring such technology to every vehicle on the road to save lives,” he said. While true autonomous driving may take years, if not longer, to achieve, Li said he sees adoption starting from confined areas such as ports and expanding quickly from there. Separately, in an interview with Reuters, Li said Hesai plans to reduce the price of its key product by half next year. This will take the next-generation ATX lidar down to below $200, half the price of the current model. Li also hit back at a US decision to place Hesai on a Chinese Military Company blacklist — which names companies the Department of Defense alleges have contributed to civilian military efforts by the People’s Liberation Army — a move which has weighed on the shares. Hesai was added to the list in January, briefly removed in August and then reinstated in October. The company has started legal action against the Pentagon, Li said in the interview. “We have zero connection to the Chinese military,” Li said. “We believe we were wrongly added to this list,” he added, saying the sensors have no capability to transfer data. “It is scanning the road, but there’s no way it should be a concern for national security, data security or even privacy in the sense that it doesn’t capture facial features.” --With assistance from Huiao Cui and Joanne Wong.

They’re not mandatory requirements. We can negotiate.” The email indicates the EV maker is positioning itself to weather further discounts in the coming year. The price war in China’s auto market, which has raged for at least two years, has driven a wave of consolidation and pushed smaller players to the brink. Western automakers such as Volkswagen AG (VOW3.DE, VWAGY) and Stellantis (STLA, STLAM.MI) have teamed up with Chinese brands such as Xpeng Inc. (XPEV, 9868.HK) and Zhejiang Leapmotor Technology Co. (9863.HK) to try to leverage their EV expertise, while premium EV-brand HiPhi and Shanghai-based WM Motor are mired in bankruptcy proceedings. BYD has so far come through the turmoil largely unscathed, if not strengthened. Earlier this year it led a new round of industry-wide price cuts, successfully gaining market share and squeezing weaker rivals. It continues to deliver record levels of revenue and income. In the most recent quarter, its revenue overtook Tesla Inc.’s (TSLA) for the first time and its gross margin rose to 21.9%, its highest level in a year. The EV maker has grown to become China’s best-selling car brand, having sold around 3.2 million plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles this year, including a record half-a-million cars in October. It is on track to sell at least 4 million units by the end of the year. —With assistance from Linda Lew.

The crown jewel of his company, Adani Green, is an energy park in western Gujarat state planned to be five times the size of Paris on completion, and producing 50 gigawatts by 2030, or roughly a tenth of India's clean energy goals. Now the plan faces a hurdle in the form of a U.S. indictment of Adani, his nephew and executive director Sagar Adani and managing director Vneet S. Jaain, accusing them of paying bribes of $265 million to secure Indian power supply contracts, and misleading U.S. investors during fund raises there. Since the news, stock of Adani Green has nosedived 36%, losing $9.6 billion in market value. Adani Group has denied the accusations in the U.S. indictment as baseless, and vowed to seek all legal recourse. But fund-raising could get complicated. ""To the extent of raising additional capital for newer projects, any sort of regulatory issues become problematic,"" said Deepika Mundra, a senior analyst at M&G Investments based in Britain. ""Particularly if you want to tap international markets."" Adani Green is one of many public and private companies key to helping India achieve its goals, she added. ""It is quite important that all these (Adani Green) projects go through."" The Adani Green boom is reflected in a surge of 10,000% in its shares between 2018 and 2022 as power demand in India swells, spurring it to develop the energy park in Khavda in Gujarat. ""For us, this renewable energy park is a symbol of our commitment to sustainability and a symbol of national pride,"" Adani wrote in his annual report in June. When complete, its output would be ""enough to power nations like Belgium, Chile, and Switzerland"", he added. Adani has committed investment of $100 billion in the renewables sector, seen as core to the ports-to-airports conglomerate that is worth more than $135 billion. Now the tide is turning for Adani Green, described by U.S. prosecutors as being at the heart of ""The Corrupt Solar Project"". After the U.S. indictment, TotalEnergies, which holds a stake of nearly 19.8% in Adani Green, was among the first to react, saying it would not invest more in the group for now. It had not been made aware of the bribery case, even though Sagar Adani was served a grand jury subpeona last year by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, it added. The Qatar Investment Authority, with a stake of 2.7%, declined comment. But standing firm for now is GQG Investors, which holds a stake of 4.2%. In an internal client note seen by Reuters, it said, ""We believe the fundamentals of the companies we are invested in remain sound."" Adani Green added power capacity of 37% each year to reach 11.2 GW by September this year, from a mere 2 GW in the 2018-19 financial year. Its next big target is 50 GW goal by 2030, or a capacity addition of 31% each year, it told investors in a presentation in November. 'RENEWABLE ENERGY MARVEL' Adani Green's revenues of $574 million during the period from April to September this year were up 20% on the year, boosting its cash profit 27% to $313 million over that time. With large solar, wind and hybrid power developments in Gujarat and the desert state of Rajasthan, it is developing smaller pumped-storage hydro power projects in five Indian states. The facilities in Rajasthan and Gujarat were to have supplied the power contracted for in the Adani deals that U.S. prosecutors allege to have been granted after payment of bribes. One of them is the partly developed marquee project in Khavda, just 18 miles (30 km) from the international border with Pakistan. It is described by Adani as ""a renewable energy marvel in the making"". Adani is targeting a massive jump in operational capacity at the location to 30 GW by 2029, up from 2.25 GW now. Energy from the park can power 16.1 million homes each year, Adani says. Reuters was among media which toured the project site in April, when thousands of labourers worked on construction and scores of solar panels were being installed. Engineers that day talked up the potential of the project, which would sprawl across 540 sq km (210 sq miles) when complete, saying it would be visible from space. ""The kind of support being provided by the central government, and I must say, the state governments also, is extraordinary,"" Managing Director Vneet S. Jaain said at the time.

Kyiv has said it wants to end the transit deal, which will bring an end to more than half a century of gas flows from Siberia to the markets of central Europe that began during Soviet times and has been a steady source of Russian budget revenues. While Ukraine has said it would not consider extending the transit deal, which generates up to $1 billion per year in transit fees for Kyiv, Moscow has signalled it was open for talks and continuation of the flows via the route. Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that Moscow was ready to continue pumping gas through Ukraine. Russia, which before the Ukraine war was Europe's number one natural gas supplier, has lost almost all of its European customers as the European Union tries to wean itself off Russian energy and after the Nord Stream pipeline to Germany was blown up in 2022. According to the person familiar with Gazprom's plans, which are yet to be approved by the top management, Russia's base-case scenario is that there will be no gas transit via Ukraine next year. That person spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation. The source said Russian gas exports to ""far abroad"" - Gazprom's term for Europe and Turkey, excluding ex-Soviet countries - are expected to fall by a fifth in 2025 to just below 39 billion cubic metres from more than 49 bcm expected this year due to the end of the Ukrainian route. That covers supplies to Turkey via the TurkStream and Blue Stream pipelines and excludes exports to China, which are expected to reach 38 bcm next year via the Power of Siberia pipeline. Russian gas exports to Turkey are unlikely to fall. Gazprom did not reply to a request for comment. Since the discovery of major Siberian gas deposits after World War Two, Soviet and post-Soviet leaders have spent half a century building up an energy business that linked the Soviet Union, then Russia, with Europe's economies. War, and explosions, have almost destroyed that link, hurting the economies of both Russia and Europe, which is now much more dependent on U.S. gas supplies. Russian gas supplies to Europe via Ukraine are already relatively small. Russia shipped about 15 billion cubic metres (bcm) of gas via Ukraine in 2023 - only 8% of peak Russian gas flows to Europe via various routes in 2018-2019. The Soviet-era Urengoy-Pomary-Uzhgorod pipeline brings gas from Siberia via the town of Sudzha - now under control of Ukrainian military forces - in Russia's Kursk region. It then flows through Ukraine to Slovakia. About 14.65 billion bcm of gas was supplied via Sudzha in 2023, or about half of Russian natural gas exports to Europe. EU gas consumption fell to 295 bcm in 2023.

U.S. District Court in Delaware is auctioning shares in PDV Holding to repay $21.3 billion in claims against Venezuela and state-oil firm PDVSA for expropriations and debt defaults. The recommendation in a court filing came after an up to $7.3 billion bid by an affiliate of activist fund Elliott Investment Management failed to win support from creditors. At least two groups had told the court they could present offers if allowed to re-enter the bidding contest. Court adviser Robert Pincus proposed to re-launch the auction after being admonished by the judge for a lack of an agreement that met terms set more than a year ago. The adviser had granted Elliott exclusive negotiating rights and would have let it defer payments, conditions that creditors said unduly favored Elliott. Elliott's wholly owned affiliate, Amber Energy, which in September was named the original auction's winner but never concluded a deal, said in a court filing the proposed terms ""will create a chaotic environment that will negatively impact the purchase price."" Amber had previously said it would walk away if the judge in the case rejected its terms. A spokesperson declined to immediately comment on its next steps. The adviser's plan for starting afresh largely followed Judge Leonard Stark's prescription for how to revive the sale. But Special Master Robert Pincus recommended against Stark's suggestion that cases seeking the same assets go ahead, saying other bidders likely would not accept the risk of rival claims. Pincus proposed to reopen to bidders Citgo financial and operational data and formally re-launch the auction on Dec. 18 and accept bids for three months. A final recommendation to the court could come in April with judge Stark holding a hearing to confirm any winner in late May, he proposed.

Financial support made up of loans, insurances and guarantees from state-affiliated organizations is set to amount to 14.3 trillion won ($10.2 billion) next year in an elevation of continued policy stimulus, the Finance Ministry said Wednesday. Separately, the government plans to cover “a significant share” of the 1.8 trillion won needed to bury power cables underground in chipmaking clusters south of Seoul, it said in a statement. South Korea had already kicked off a 26 trillion won aid package in July, part of which will be reflected in next year’s support amount. Separately, the government will seek to increase the tax credit rate for semiconductor-related firms by 10 percentage points and build a national “artificial intelligence computing center” worth 4 trillion won by 2030, it said Wednesday. South Korea is stepping up its support for the crown jewel of its economy at a time when President-elect Donald Trump vows to bolster US manufacturing and reduce reliance on foreign supply chains. While the nation has continued to funnel fiscal support into chipmakers, Trump’s election has added urgency to safeguarding the growth of the industry. In its statement the ministry said there is potential for economic uncertainties to grow after the new US administration is inaugurated, even though US-South Korean ties in defense and shipbuilding could still benefit. South Korea’s biggest company, Samsung Electronics Co., in particular is building a semiconductor factory in Texas with subsidies promised under the Biden administration’s Chips Act. Trump’s camp repeatedly criticized that funding program during the election campaign. China may also ratchet up its pursuit of South Korea in supply chains, raising the need for Seoul to help shore up the competitiveness of its tech industries, the Finance Ministry said. A rising wave of protectionist polices may also dent South Korea’s trade-reliant economy, it said. Technology exports account for roughly a third of South Korea’s shipments abroad. The economy is expected to be on course to grow at least 2% this year compared with 2023, particularly on the back of strong demand for semiconductors, including memory chips used in artificial intelligence development. Forecasts among economists for next year are turning less optimistic after the export rally has softened in recent months.

The company is expanding beyond its rideshare roots to enter a hot new market: helping other businesses outsource some of their artificial intelligence development to independent contractors. Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Italy’s Motor City, Car-Free Options Are Growing In Traffic-Weary Toronto, a Battle Breaks Out Over Bike Lanes In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field Its new AI training and data labeling division, called Scaled Solutions, builds on an internal team that tackles large-scale annotation tasks for Uber’s rideshare, food delivery and freight units. According to its website, Scaled Solutions has begun serving other companies that also need high-quality datasets. Clients include Aurora Innovation Inc., an Uber-backed firm that makes self-driving software for commercial trucks, and Niantic Inc., the game developer behind Pokémon Go. Uber’s efforts to sell data labeling services have not previously been reported. The move could allow it to gain a piece of a growing market, as global companies rely on humans to vet data to train AI models. Scale AI Inc, which offers similar services, is valued at $14 billion, making it one of the hottest artificial intelligence startups. The rideshare giant has plenty of experience recruiting contractors, as it has done for years with drivers and couriers. Now the company is betting that it can help other businesses by getting enough skilled workers who can label images, text and videos with context for machine learning models to recognize patterns and make accurate predictions and recommendations. To perform this work for more companies, Uber this month started signing up contractors with various skills in India, the US, Canada, Poland and Nicaragua. Earnings will be determined by each task they complete and paid out monthly, according to the FAQ section of its onboarding website, which is separate from the platform for recruiting drivers and delivery couriers. It also has corporate job postings for San Francisco, New York and Chicago-based account executives who will manage Uber’s relationship with Scaled Solutions’ enterprise customers. “Having performed these tasks at scale over the past decade as part of our own growth, we deeply understand the needs of companies requiring these services,” an Uber spokesperson said in an emailed statement. Hiring independent contractors aligns “with our expertise as one of the world’s largest providers of flexible work opportunities,” the spokesperson added. The firm declined to share revenue or customer numbers, or elaborate on how much it charges per project. Uber’s internal Scaled Solutions team is based across the US and India, and has employed both humans and automation to help validate maps and ensure accurate translation to localize its rideshare product in various markets. The group has also digitized photos of restaurant menus for the Uber Eats app and tested new features across thousands of mobile devices. Outside the organization, the team is helping Aurora ensure accuracy when its software classifies objects on the road, including pedestrians, debris and other vehicles, an Aurora spokesperson said. Uber’s contractors have also evaluated location data for Niantic, which is trying to build a 3D map of the world for its augmented reality games and other game developers, said Erin Schaefer, Niantic’s senior vice president overseeing game publishing and operations. In addition, Uber plans to enlist workers to use their cultural knowledge to adapt products to local markets, or use their programming knowledge to provide feedback on an AI chatbot’s responses to software engineering questions. Prior to opening up the platform for public registration, Uber this year began recruiting freelancers with coding or language skills to help evaluate outputs of large language models, the technology underpinning generative AI tools like OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Microsoft Corp.’s Copilot. An India-based software engineer, who requested anonymity citing fear of reprisal, said they were given two AI-generated responses to a complex coding problem and asked to compare and rate the correctness of the AI’s answers based on several criteria. Those include functionality, efficiency and formatting of the code, according to documents seen by Bloomberg News. The engineer reported completing three questions for a fee of 200 rupees ($2.37) per set. It’s unclear how wages will differ in the various locations where Uber is onboarding contractors for Scaled Solutions. The tasks are similar to some offered by existing annotation platforms like Scale AI’s Remotasks or Data Annotation Tech that have appealed to remote workers hoping to earn extra income through online gig work. The industry has also come under fire for underpaying outsourced workers in developing countries. Remotasks, for example, claims on its website to offer as much as $18 per hour to English-speaking, US-based workers, but The Verge reported last year that a Remotasks worker in Nairobi was paid about $10 for annotating 8-hour-long video footage for self-driving cars.

Scale is becoming important even for distributors, who need to navigate the technological rivalry between the US and China and the resulting export controls and supply chain snarls, according to Macnica President Kazumasa Hara. China, Southeast Asia, India and South Korea are all areas of interest, he said. “We need to raise our market share as quickly as possible,” Hara said in an interview, adding that Macnica’s market presence remains low in growth regions such as China and Southeast Asia. An acquisition is “one option” and a deal requiring an investment of billions of dollars is “very likely,” he said.

In April, Macnica bought one such competitor, Glosel Co., and the sector’s also seen the merger of Ryoyo Electro Corp. and Ryosan Co., but Hara said he isn’t eager for another acquisition at home. The company should be able to hit its market share target of 30% or more in 2030 organically, he said, reflecting growing concentration of business seen in chip distribution elsewhere. The Yokohama-based company, which often draws comparisons with factory automation provider Keyence Corp., may also conduct acquisitions to expand into other arenas, such as cybersecurity, Hara said. “When you look ahead, that’s one area that will grow,” he said. The goal is to lower Macnica’s reliance on semiconductors, which account for 90% of its sales. In addition to cybersecurity, it’s exploring arenas that are less capital-intensive than semiconductors, such as self-driving car networks and health care. Macnica’s stock is down about 40% from a February high, in part due to its exposure to industrial equipment chips in China. “It’s important to always be on the lookout for cutting-edge technologies to commercialize, just as we did with semiconductors in the past,” Hara said.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morning-bid-holiday-bound-us-111821614.html,"Wed, Nov 27, 2024, 3:18 AM","A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan With Wall Street about to log off for what's effectively a four-day Thanksgiving holiday, trade tariff jitters are replaced by inflation angst as the Federal Reserve gets another price check. Although big automakers took a hit, broad U.S. stock indexes seemed unperturbed on Tuesday by President-elect Donald Trump's threat of 25% tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China. The main heat was in the Mexican peso, Canadian dollar and their related bourses - while stocks in Europe, Japan and South Korea wobbled again. But the S&P500 gained more than half a percentage point through the session, closing back above 6,000 at another record high. Futures were back off marginally ahead of today's bell. With trading thinning this week, stocks are still feeding off assumptions about the extent of Trump's agenda of tax cuts, tariff rises and immigration crackdowns. Surveys showing a jump in consumer confidence this month helped. There's also been some relief this week from a calming of the Treasury market, with yields retreating in a week of big debt sales - due to mix of optimism about money manager Scott Bessent's nomination as Treasury Secretary and an ebbing crude oil price following the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire. Minutes from the Fed's post-election meeting this month showed policymakers divided over how much further they may need to cut interest rates from here, avoiding much guidance on the forward trajectory. Part of the Fed's problem is visibility over the impact of Trump's economic plans. Goldman Sachs' 'ready reckoner', for example, shows a 25% tariff on U.S. imports from Canada, Mexico and China - more than 43% of all U.S. imports - would generate government revenue of about 1% of GDP. But, by lifting the effective U.S. tariff rate by 8.6%, it would boost the core PCE price index by 0.9%. Wednesday gets two cuts of that personal consumption expenditures inflation gauge - along with third quarter GDP revisions and the monthly update from October. The latter is expected to show annual headline and core PCE inflation gauges - the Fed's favored measures - ticking back up to 2.3% and 2.8% respectively. And yet Treasury yields continued to retreat ahead of those releases, falling back to levels seen just after the November election. Even market inflation expectations, captured by 10-year inflation swaps or 'breakeven' rates in inflation-protected Treasuries, are ebbing too. Some of the optimism in Treasuries may have come from indications in the Fed minutes that some policymakers believe it may soon be time to lower the interest rate on funds that banks and money market funds park at the Fed - so that it once again matches the bottom of the Fed's policy rate range. The so-called overnight reverse repurchase agreement rate, one of two technical lending rates the Fed uses to ensure the federal funds rate stays within its monetary policy target range, is currently set at 4.55%, while the policy rate range is 4.5% to 4.75%. The fallback in U.S. yields also took the steam out of the dollar, whose main index slipped back further from Friday's two-year highs and skidded sharply against Japan's yen, which was last up 1.2%. Some of the moves were exaggerated by the holidays stateside and end-of-month positioning. There was a mixed picture in overseas markets. Europe's stocks continue to fall on everything from the trade war worries to France's political impasse over its budget. European auto stocks slid for a second day on world trade jitters. French stocks and bonds were hit hard, driving the premium the government pays for long-term borrowing to its highest since the euro zone debt crisis of 2012, as investors grow uneasy over the fate of the new government and its budget. Prime Minister Michel Barnier told French broadcaster TF1 on Tuesday that France could face fiscal turmoil if his government falls. Far-right leader Marine Le Pen has been threatening to topple France's coalition government in a no-confidence vote, over a disagreement with Barnier over the proposed budget, which contains measures to cut spending and raise taxes. Among French lenders, Societe Generale and BNP Paribas fell around 2% each. Elsewhere, China and Hong Kong stocks outperformed as data showed a less sharp decline in industrial profits, while traders placed bets Beijing will roll out more supportive policies to counter the risks of U.S. tariffs.

Following the inquiry’s recommendation, the legislation is expected to come to a vote in Parliament by Thursday evening, when it will likely pass due to support from the center-left Labor government and the center-right Liberal-National opposition. However there is growing concern among some lawmakers on both sides of the aisle about the speed at which the bills have moved. Opposition Senator Matt Canavan said in a dissenting opinion in the report that the legislation had been “forced through the Parliament with a haste not befitting its radical and unprecedented nature.” Canavan said in total the bills to ban children from social media will have had less than one week of public scrutiny. “The public first saw the legislation to ban children under 16 from social media last Thursday, submissions closed on Friday, a public hearing was held on Monday and the committee’s report is due on Tuesday. The bill is likely to be voted on by the end of this sitting week,” he said in his dissenting opinion. Joining Canavan in opposing the bills is the left-wing Greens Party, which said the speed at which the laws were being put into place was “rushed, reckless and goes against expert evidence.” Under the proposed law, social media platforms will be responsible for policing the ban on children under age 16 from having accounts on popular services such as Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat. It is unclear at this stage how services will verify the age of users.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-prices-steady-amid-focus-015825821.html,"Wed, Nov 27, 2024, 7:51 AM","By Arathy Somasekhar (Reuters) -Oil prices edged lower on Wednesday as a large, surprise build in U.S. gasoline stocks outweighed easing supply concerns from a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah. Brent crude futures fell 12 cents, or 0.2%, to $723.69 a barrel by 10:40 a.m. ET (1540 GMT) and U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude eased 15 cents, or 0.2%, to $68.64. U.S. gasoline stocks rose by 3.3 million barrels in the week to 212.2 million barrels, the Energy Information Administration said, compared with analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for a 46,000-barrel draw.​ Crude stocks fell by 1.8 million barrels in the week ended Nov. 22, the EIA added, compared with analysts' expectations in a Reuters poll for a 605,000-barrel draw. Market sources, citing the American Petroleum Institute, had said on Tuesday that oil inventories fell by 5.94 million barrels and fuel inventories rose last week. Both benchmarks had settled lower on Tuesday after Israel agreed to a ceasefire deal with Lebanon's Hezbollah, effective Wednesday after both sides accepted the agreement brokered by the U.S. and France. A ceasefire between Israel and Lebanese armed group Hezbollah held on Wednesday after the two sides struck the deal, a rare feat of diplomacy in the Middle East, wracked by two wars and several proxy conflicts for over a year. ""The real question will be for how long it (the ceasefire) will truly be honoured,"" said Dennis Kissler, senior vice president of trading at BOK Financial. Supporting prices, sources from the OPEC+ group comprising the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia have said the producer group is discussing a further delay to the oil output increase set for January. The group, which produces about half the world's oil, had aimed to gradually ease production cuts through 2024 and 2025, but weaker global demand and rising output outside OPEC+ have cast doubt on that plan. The decision will be made at the Dec.1 meeting. Heads of commodities research at Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley said that oil prices are undervalued, citing a market deficit and risk to Iranian supply from possible sanctions under U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. ""With the President-Elect Trump's sanctions soon to come, many think Iran will be targeted, which could slow their exports substantially,"" BOK's Kissler said. Trump said he would impose a 25% tariff on all products coming into the U.S. from Mexico and Canada. Crude oil would not be exempt from the trade penalties, sources told Reuters on Tuesday. Oil industry analysts and traders warned the move would likely raise oil prices for U.S. refiners, squeezing margins and driving up the cost of fuel. ""We expect WTI to trade within the range of $65-$70 a barrel, factoring in weather conditions during the Northern Hemisphere's winter, a potential increase in shale oil and gas production under the incoming Donald Trump administration in the U.S. and demand trends in China,"" said Hiroyuki Kikukawa, president of NS Trading, part of Nissan Securities.

Patrick Pouyanne's comments on the sidelines of an energy conference come after the United States indicted Adani Green Energy's chairman, executive director, former CEO, and five others over an alleged $265 million bribery scheme. TotalEnergies said on Monday it would pause financial contributions to its Adani Group investments until there was more clarity over the case. The French group is one of a few oil majors continuing to expand in renewable energy, and the rapidly growing Indian solar market has made up a significant share of its expansion to date. TotalEnergies and Adani Green Energy have 3.8 gigawatts (GW) of jointly held wind and solar projects under construction or in development - which TotalEnergies has already paid into, and which are expected to continue. ""We didn't say we will exit: we will not put new financing in any new scheme,"" Pouyanne said on the sidelines of the Energy Intelligence Forum on Tuesday. TotalEnergies has paid a total of $3.24 billion for its 19.75% stake in Adani Green Energy and three renewable joint ventures. Unfinished projects with Adani are included in TotalEnergies' current green growth targets to add 11 GW of new renewables by the end of next year and reach 100 GW of gross installed capacity by 2030, up from 24 GW currently. TotalEnergies has relied heavily on buying Indian wind and solar assets to quickly grow its green portfolio, overtaking European oil and gas peers. Adani-linked stakes account for nearly 25% of its currently operating renewable assets. Pouyanne said the pause on future projects with Adani did not jeopardise TotalEnergies' ability to continue that growth. ""We have other options in our portfolio,"" said the CEO. Excluding India, TotalEnergies has 5.6 GW of renewables under construction globally and 53.6 GW under development, mostly in North America and Europe, according to company statements. The firm, which has a seat on Adani Green Energy's board, said on Monday it had not been aware of the U.S. investigation before last week's indictment, and that TotalEnergies legally purchased the solar stakes after performing due diligence.

Where HP surprised favorably for the first time in a while was its printing business. Printing sales rose 1% from the prior year and came in ahead of expectations. The upside could stem from struggles at rival Xerox (XRX), which is smack in the middle of deep restructuring that pros say is causing market share loss. ""On print, results from peers such as Xerox came in below expectations, with Xerox's printing equipment sales declining double-digits year over year due in part to an increase in competitive activity in certain markets,"" Evercore ISI analyst Amit Daryanani said in a client note.

In a complaint filed against PJM Interconnection with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Friday, Constellation alleged that some local utilities are using the lack of such rules to thwart competition from power generators by opposing the so-called co-located data centers. The federal regulator earlier in November had rejected an agreement to increase the power capacity of a data center connected directly to a nuclear plant in Pennsylvania, citing risks to grid reliability and a rise in costs for consumers. Constellation, which is the largest operator of U.S. nuclear power plants, had backed Talen Energy in that regulatory battle. Connecting large data centers directly with power plants has emerged as a major priority for Big Tech's plans to quickly access large amounts of power for its AI expansion instead of waiting for years to connect to the grid. Constellation also said utility firm Exelon, its former parent, refusing to finish interconnection work at the LaSalle nuclear plant to support co-location of a data center could add $15 million to $19 million in costs. PJM, Constellation and Exelon did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A time-consuming complaint would prove to be negative for the power companies, Jefferies analysts said in a note.

(AAPL) barely managed growth, an independent study showed, underscoring the speed with which Android-based rivals are gaining ground in China and emerging markets.

But iPhone volumes likely edged just 0.4% higher. Still, Apple remains by far the profit leader with an average selling price surpassing $1,000, while Android rivals collectively came in at around $295, IDC estimates. The latest study highlights the uneven recovery of the smartphone market, which slumped in the post-Covid era despite the advent of AI. Much of that 2024 growth came from pent-up demand and regions with lower smartphone penetration, IDC said. More affordable devices from Android vendors helped Chinese brands better capture that opportunity, while Apple is forecast to fare better next year. The addition of artificial intelligence enhancements, a big theme among the likes of Samsung Electronics Co. (005930.KS, SSNLF), Apple and Alphabet Inc.’s (GOOG, GOOGL) Google, failed to excite consumers. “While GenAI continues to be a hot topic and top priority for many vendors, it is yet to impact demand significantly and drive early upgrades,” said Nabila Popal, research director at IDC. “More investments are needed to increase consumer awareness and introduce a ‘must have’ feature that will rush consumers to the store and create that super cycle which everyone is waiting for.” Brands like Xiaomi Corp. (XIACY, 81810.HK) and Huawei Technologies Co. are pouring investment into hardware and designing their own processors — in a bid to mitigate the threat or effects of US sanctions while customizing their designs for AI use cases. Huawei on Tuesday introduced its latest smartphone powered by its made-in-China chips, while Xiaomi is preparing an in-house semiconductor for 2025 devices. In China’s highly competitive market, where a half-dozen companies trade the top spot each quarter, large and prolonged discounts stimulated sales. Those had more of an effect than in the previous year, though concern about the country’s ailing economy is likely to persist. Globally, shipments have yet to return to pre-pandemic levels, and IDC doesn’t expect anything more than low-single-digit growth for years to come. Lengthening times between upgrades, market saturation in developed economies and a rapidly growing trade in used smartphones are seen as the major factors contributing to stagnation. —With assistance from Gao Yuan.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/t-mobile-engineers-spotted-hackers-140051419.html,"Wed, Nov 27, 2024, 6:00 AM","(Bloomberg) -- Suspicious behavior on T-Mobile US Inc.’s network devices tipped off the company to a breach that was potentially part of a sprawling cyber-espionage campaign that has raised urgent questions about the exposure of a critical sector of the economy. Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Italy’s Motor City, Car-Free Options Are Growing In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field NYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge Jeff Simon, T-Mobile’s chief security officer, said in an interview with Bloomberg News that while the behavior wasn’t “inherently malicious,” it was unusual enough to draw the attention of the company’s network engineers. In recent weeks, the engineers had spotted unauthorized users running commands on the company’s network devices, seeming to probe the structure of the network, Simon said. Upon discovery, the engineers booted the bad actors from the network before they got deeper into the network or accessed customer data. “That was what initially clued us into some suspicious behavior, discovery-type commands being run on some of our routers and commands that have been known to be related to Salt Typhoon,” he said. Salt Typhoon is the name of an alleged Chinese state-sponsored hacking group that is believed to be behind the campaign. China has repeatedly denied involvement. T-Mobile is the first carrier to publicly offer a profile of markers potentially associated with Salt Typhoon, a name given to the hacking group by Microsoft Corp. US officials have accused Chinese state-sponsored hackers of a “broad and significant” spying campaign that has breached multiple telecommunications companies, but the companies believed to be prime targets have said little themselves. The hackers, embedded in routers and burrowing deeper into communications networks for months, were able to access details of those subject to lawful surveillance targets - potentially exposing US efforts to track down foreign agents, according to two people familiar with the matter. They also spied on communications belonging to what the FBI has said is a “limited number” of people in government and politics, according to the US. That included President-Elect Donald Trump, Vice President-Elect JD Vance and staffers for Vice President Kamala Harris. AT&T and Verizon were among the companies breached in the hacking campaign, according to the Wall Street Journal. T-Mobile said it, too, was breached with methods that appeared similar to those used by Salt Typhoon. However, T-Mobile said it was able to contain the intrusion before it left network routers and reached customers’ phones. The company said the threat originated from a “wireline” —- or non-wireless — provider’s network that connected to T-Mobile’s. On Friday, the White House summoned leaders from the telecommunications industry to a meeting to try to address the series of intrusions that Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, recently described as a “sprawling and catastrophic” infiltration. The meeting, which included representatives from AT&T, T-Mobile and Lumen Technologies Inc., lasted about two hours and focused on plotting a path forward with both the private and public sectors, according to participants. “Telecommunications companies alone are not likely to have success with it if we don’t work together,” said Simon, who represented T-Mobile at the meeting.“And so that’s really what I came out with, is ‘Let’s find ways to work together, private-sector companies and public sector, to be able to combat this sophisticated threat.’” AT&T Chief Executive Officer John Stankey and Lumen CEO Kate Johnson attended the meeting, according to representatives from both companies. Verizon didn’t respond to a request for comment Tuesday. The industry has been sharing more information internally in recent months, Simon said, particularly when it’s details the companies can use to combat Salt Typhoon. Threat intelligence firms, security research companies and the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency have also shared intelligence, he said. “I can’t promise that absolutely every single one participates at the same level. But in general, we are sharing with them, they are sharing with us,” he said, specifically calling out Verizon as “a standout partner in sharing intelligence with the rest of the community.” T-Mobile believes its network was less exposed to the threat partly because it’s the only carrier with an end-to-end 5G network, meaning traffic does not pass over older equipment from the 2G, 3G and 4G eras, and it has minimal contact with older wired infrastructure, like cable or copper networks. The 5G technology standard has enhanced encryption and privacy protections built into it, and the physical devices are also guaranteed to be newer. “Most companies are not regularly, regularly refreshing their 2G infrastructure. They’re putting that money into the 5G or similar,” Simon said. --With assistance from Katrina Manson and Jamie Tarabay.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-exxon-lobbyist-investigated-over-170240002.html,"Wed, Nov 27, 2024, 9:02 AM","By Raphael Satter and Christopher Bing WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The FBI has been investigating a longtime Exxon Mobil consultant over the contractor's alleged role in a hack-and-leak operation that targeted hundreds of the oil company’s biggest critics, according to three people familiar with the matter. The operation involved mercenary hackers who successfully breached the email accounts of environmental activists and others, the sources told Reuters. The scheme allegedly began in late 2015, when U.S. authorities contend that the names of the hacking targets were compiled by the DCI Group, a public affairs and lobbying company working for Exxon at the time, one of the sources said. DCI provided the names to an Israeli private detective, who then outsourced the hacking, according to the source. In an effort to push a narrative that Exxon was the target of a political vendetta aimed at destroying its business, some of the stolen material was subsequently leaked to the media by DCI, Reuters determined. The Federal Bureau of Investigation found that DCI shared the information with Exxon before leaking it, the source said. Some environmental activists interviewed by Reuters say the hacking operation disrupted preparations for lawsuits by cities and state attorneys general against Exxon and other energy companies. Those lawsuits were modeled on litigation against the tobacco industry in the mid-1990s, which resulted in a watershed settlement and sweeping restrictions on cigarette sales. The stolen material continues to be used today to counter litigation claiming the oil giant misled the public and its investors about the risks of climate change. As recently as April, an industry trade group that has received funding from Exxon cited one of the hacked documents – an internal memo sketching out the proposed litigation strategy of the environmentalists – in an effort to get the Supreme Court to quash a lawsuit filed by the city of Honolulu against Exxon and other energy companies. The case is pending. The group, the National Association of Manufacturers, said it was not aware of the allegation the material had been hacked “and will consider whether to stop using it in future briefs.” Exxon and DCI parted ways around 2020, according to two people familiar with the matter. In a statement, Exxon said it “has not been involved in or aware of any hacking activities,” calling allegations to the contrary “conspiracy theories.” Reuters could not determine whether Exxon itself has also been the subject of the FBI investigation. DCI said: “We direct all our employees and consultants to comply with the law.” The leaks “sent a shudder through the environmental community,” said Kert Davies, director of investigations for an environmental group, the Center for Climate Integrity. Davies was among those targeted by the hackers. Matt Pawa, an attorney whose strategy drove much of the anti-Exxon litigation, said the leaks fueled a legal counteroffensive that nearly knocked him out of business. “Those documents were directly employed by Exxon to come after me with all guns blazing,” he said in a recent interview. “It turned my life upside down.” The investigation into the hack-and-leak operation comes amid growing concern among law enforcement agencies worldwide about how such cyberespionage schemes threaten to taint judicial proceedings. The FBI has been investigating the broader use of mercenary hackers to tamper with lawsuits since early 2018, Reuters has previously reported. The Israeli private detective hired by DCI, Amit Forlit, was arrested this year at London’s Heathrow Airport and is fighting extradition to the United States on charges of hacking and wire fraud. U.S. law enforcement authorities declined to comment on their efforts. They have not spoken publicly about the case against Forlit, which remains under seal. But in court hearings earlier this year, British lawyers acting on behalf of the American government alleged that Forlit had carried out hack-for-hire work for a “Washington-based PR and lobbying firm” and that he worked on behalf of an oil and gas corporation which wanted to discredit individuals involved in climate change litigation. In those hearings, the energy company and the lobbying firm were not identified. Federal prosecutors have secured a related conviction: that of Forlit’s former business associate, private investigator Aviram Azari. Azari pleaded guilty in 2022 to wire fraud, conspiracy to commit hacking and aggravated identity theft, which included targeting the environmental activists. In court files, prosecutors did not assert any link between Azari and Exxon, DCI or Forlit. But one of the sources with knowledge of the FBI investigation said Forlit outsourced the hacking of the environmental activists to Azari. Forlit’s attorneys did not respond to messages from Reuters seeking comment. A lawyer for Azari, Barry Zone, declined to comment. Addressing his victims after he was sentenced last year to 80 months in prison, Azari said that “there will come a day” when he could provide more information about what he had done. “You don't know everything,"" he said. CODENAME “FOX HUNT” The hack-and-leak operation came on the heels of a series of media reports in 2015 contending that scientists at Exxon knew for decades that fossil fuels were warming the Earth as the company's top executives publicly said otherwise. Exxon has said that its internal research and public positions on climate change have been misinterpreted. Under the hashtag “ExxonKnew,” groups such as Greenpeace called for legal action. So did then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, who said the Department of Justice should probe the firm because “there’s a lot of evidence they misled people.” In November 2015, New York’s attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, announced he was investigating Exxon. Other suits followed. With Exxon on the defensive, DCI swung into action to protect what was then one of the firm’s most important clients. Reuters interviewed a dozen former DCI employees to piece together the firm’s relationship with Exxon. Founded in 1996 by veterans of Republican politics, DCI has worked for a variety of tobacco, telecom, hedge fund and energy firms. On its website, DCI says it handles public relations crises, litigation support, and opposition research. Five former DCI employees said Exxon was long one of DCI’s biggest sources of revenue. One ex-employee said the oil giant regularly steered more than $10 million in business a year to DCI. Lobbying work alone for Exxon earned DCI at least $3 million between 2005 and 2016, according to publicly available data gathered by the transparency website OpenSecrets. DCI’s staff in Washington kept track of social media chatter around the ExxonKnew campaign as well as moves made by state attorneys general, according to two people familiar with the matter. DCI also hired the Israeli detective Forlit, who tapped Azari to hack the accounts, according to one of the sources familiar with the FBI investigation. The operation’s code name was “Fox Hunt,” the source said. Azari was the subject of a 2022 Reuters investigation that revealed how he and other private investigators used mercenary hackers in India to help wealthy clients gain the upper hand in legal cases. The report drew on a large dataset of Indian hacking activity, which shows that the spies tried to break into more than 13,000 email addresses over a seven-year period. Among the targets were more than 500 email addresses belonging to environmentalists, their funders, their colleagues and their family members, all of whom were targeted between 2015 and 2018. Some details of the hacking campaign previously have been made public. In 2020 the Canadian digital watchdog group Citizen Lab identified 10 organizations targeted in a sweeping cyberespionage effort, including Greenpeace, the Union of Concerned Scientists and the Rockefeller Family Fund. Reuters has learned the identity of other prominent targets, which include former Democratic presidential candidate and billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer, and the ex-wife of Schneiderman, New York’s then-attorney general. Steyer's lawyers did not respond to requests for comment. In an email, Schneiderman's ex-wife and former political adviser, Jennifer Cunningham, said she had long suspected that Exxon was behind the hack-and-leak effort. Beginning in April 2016, news reports appeared alleging the ExxonKnew campaign was a politicized effort pushed by wealthy benefactors. Within 24 hours of one another, two media outlets published stories based on an internal Rockefeller Family Foundation memo. The memo said activists were working to convince the public that “Exxon is a corrupt institution” and wanted to “delegitimize them as a political actor.” The person with knowledge of the law enforcement investigation said the FBI assessed that the memo was obtained via the Forlit-led hacking operation. Separately, Reuters determined that the memo was subsequently leaked to the media by DCI. Exxon’s lawyers repeatedly drew on the hacked documents to support the company’s litigation. After the New York attorney general filed suit against Exxon in 2018, for instance, the energy company’s lawyers cited the stolen Rockefeller memo to argue that the case should be thrown out. The lawyer representing Exxon, Theodore Wells, told New York’s Supreme Court in his October 2019 opening statement that Schneiderman had improperly formed “a political alignment with activists for the purpose of advancing an agenda directed at energy companies.” New York lost the case two months later, when a judge ruled that the attorney general failed to prove that Exxon had defrauded investors by hiding the true cost of climate change regulation. In an interview, Schneiderman said the leaked documents were used “to great effect” to bolster what he called Exxon’s “baseless claim that we were engaged in a politically motivated ‘witch hunt.’” Wells and his law firm, Paul Weiss, did not respond to messages seeking comment. The memo or other hacked documents were also cited in court filings by Exxon against attorneys general in Massachusetts and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as in the company's 2018 effort to depose climate change attorney Pawa and other lawyers. Much of the litigation is ongoing. On Tuesday, Maine became the ninth U.S. state to file a lawsuit accusing oil companies or allied groups of deceiving the public about climate change. Pawa said the industry has continued to invoke the hacked files in its effort to push back. “They were used over and over again,” he told Reuters. The net effect, he said, was “chilling people from exercising their constitutional rights.” (Reporting by Raphael Satter and Christopher Bing in Washington; editing by Chris Sanders and Blake Morrison)","Raphael Satter and Christopher Bing WASHINGTON - The FBI been investigating a longtime consultant over the contractor's role in a operation that hundreds oil company’s biggest according people familiar with the matter.

The company sold 20 million ADS in the offering for $13 per ADS, the top of the marketed range, to raise $260 million. Separately, a group of investors agreed to buy $153.4 million worth of ordinary shares from the company in a private placement. One ADS is equivalent to one ordinary share. The pricing gives the Guangzhou-based firm a market value of more than $4 billion, based on the outstanding ADS. Pony’s pricing was pushed back from last week as the firm increased the deal size and addressed regulator questions, Bloomberg News reported.

A unit of state-owned automaker Beijing Automotive Group Co., and the venture capital arm of Singaporean taxi firm ComfortDelGro Corp. had indicated an interest in purchasing as much as roughly $75 million worth of Pony’s offering, according to an earlier filing. Pony develops and operates self-driving vehicles including trucks and robotaxis in the US and China.

Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Italy’s Motor City, Car-Free Options Are Growing In Traffic-Weary Toronto, a Battle Breaks Out Over Bike Lanes In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field Earnings, excluding some items, will be 70 cents to 76 cents a share in the fiscal first quarter, the company said Tuesday in a statement. Analysts, on average, projected 86 cents in the period ending in January, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. For the fiscal year, profit will be $3.45 to $3.75 a share, compared with an average estimate of $3.60. An increase in component costs, rather than any issues with demand, is hurting profitability, Chief Executive Officer Enrique Lores said in an interview. Prices of parts should decline as the year goes on, he added. The shares fell about 6% in extended trading after closing at $39.10 in New York. The stock had jumped 30% this year through the close. The PC market had seen a historic decline in recent years after many consumers, businesses and schools purchased laptops in the early months of the pandemic. While signs of a rebound began to materialize this year, shipments again dipped in the third quarter, industry analyst firm IDC said in October. PC makers had hoped that new machines touted as better for artificial intelligence workloads would spur demand. But “buyers have yet to see clear benefits or business value,” Mikako Kitagawa, an analyst at Gartner Inc., said in report last month. For the fiscal fourth quarter, HP reported sales increased 1.7% to $14.1 billion, just ahead of analyst expectations. It marked the company’s second consecutive period of year-over-year revenue growth after eight straight quarters of declines. Profit, excluding some items, was 93 cents per share, in line with estimates. HP’s personal computer business reported revenue rose 2% to $9.59 billion, missing the average estimate of $9.74 billion. This was due to a smaller-than-expected boost in sales of computers to business. The release of Microsoft Corp.’s new edition of Windows hasn’t fueled PC demand as quickly as in previous releases, Lores said. HP’s printing segment grew 1% to $4.5 billion, the first expansion for the business since late 2021. Analysts, on average, predicted a decline of almost 4%.

Low-hire, low-fire. ""We are in a 'low-hire, low-fire' environment,"" Bank of America's lead economist Aditya Bhave said in a note on Tuesday. ""In the spring of 2022, there were two open jobs for every unemployed person. Now that figure is just a little more than one. In other words, there aren’t as many opportunities out there."" Job openings for the month of September fell to their lowest level since January 2021 while the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, also dropped to 1.9% from a revised 2% in August. The number of open jobs per unemployed worker stood at 1.09. ""The low level of quits is consistent with a decline in the availability of employment opportunities,"" Oxford Economics lead US economist Nancy Vanden Houten said at the time. New data released by the Department of Labor on Wednesday showed that initial filings for unemployment insurance hit a seven-month low in the week ending Nov. 23, with 213,000 initial claims filed. That's down from the 215,000 the week prior and below the 215,000 economists had expected. But the number of people making continuing claims, or those filing for unemployment benefits for at least two straight weeks, rose to 1.907 million last week, the highest level since November 2021. Samuel Tombs, chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote Wednesday, ""The recent pick-up in continuing claims broadly supports the idea that the flow of initial claims still is high enough for unemployment to continue to rise."" The unemployment rate in October stood at 4.1%, down from this summer's high of 4.3% but up from 3.8% a year ago. Job growth has not only slowed overall but recent hiring trends have been concentrated in just a handful of sectors. Bank of America pointed out that three sectors — health care & education, leisure & hospitality, and government — have driven hiring patterns over the last six quarters. Over the last three months, nonfarm payroll growth has slowed to just 104,000, on average. ""Other industries have basically been stagnant for the last few months,"" the team wrote. Despite the rise in the unemployment rate, Bhave and team noted that overall layoffs have remained low, noting that ""while the labor market has moderated, it hasn't rolled over."" ""A spike in layoffs would create a negative feedback loop between consumption and the labor market,"" Bank of America's Bhave said. ""For now though, the layoff rate is below pre-pandemic levels, consistent with the low level of unemployment insurance claims."" The latest consumer confidence reading reached its highest level since July 2023 in November, mostly driven by optimism over the labor market and future job availability as layoffs remain scarce. More broadly, the US economy has remained resilient, with economic output once again estimated to have expanded at a solid 2.8% pace in the third quarter, despite high interest rates and sticky inflation. ""The US economy has probably weathered the impact of Fed hikes,"" Bhave wrote. Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

To date, Musk has posted more than 60,000 times on X, the social media network formerly known as Twitter that he purchased in 2022. For years after Musk joined the platform in 2009, he mainly tweeted memes, jokes, and occasionally about his array of companies. Now, he posts on X daily about politics, the media, and the corporate landscape. As the social media company's CEO, the richest person in the world, and a member of Trump's next administration, even Musk's passing thoughts on X are taken seriously. When he joked about buying the news outlet MSNBC, it prompted a widespread fake claim that one of the network's hosts cried on air in response, even though the company isn't actually for sale. Although it may take Musk only a few seconds to craft his posts on X, they have had real influence over what trends online and the price of assets. Here is a look at the times Musk's words have had immediate impact: More: Supreme Court rejects Elon Musk's appeal in SEC fight over what he can post on X In a series of posts last weekend, Musk ridiculed F-35 fighter jets on X. He shared a video of drone swarms with the caption, ""Meanwhile, some idiots are still building manned fighter jets like the F-35."" Stock prices for American defense contractors, who help manufacture the jets, quickly responded. Lockheed Martin stock declined 3.75% and Northrop Grumman stock fell 2.3%, setting four-month lows for the companies, according to Investor's Business Daily. After Trump announced Musk would co-lead a new Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, the valuation of a cryptocurrency by a similar name soared. Musk hyped up Dogecoin, a meme cryptocurrency often associated with the tech billionaire, on X in the hours surrounding Trump's statement. He posted AI-generated images and memes including the coin's Shiba Inu dog mascot. Five hours before Trump's 6 AM announcement, Dogecoin's market capitalization was nearly $53 billion. CoinMarketCap reported that number rose to $62.8 billion by 10 a.m. the same day. As of this Wednesday afternoon, Dogecoin's market capitalization was sitting at about $59 billion. The Security and Exchange Commission is likely still keeping an eye on Musk's activity on X years after it told him he needs to be more careful about what he posts regarding Tesla, his electric vehicle company. The commission first went after Musk in 2018 when he posted that he was ""considering taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured."" At the time, the SEC called his posts that boosted Tesla's stock price ""false and misleading."" Musk settled with the SEC, agreeing to pay a $20 million fine, step down as chairman, and agree to get a lawyer's approval before posting about Tesla. However, Musk continued to post about the company. When he posted in 2020 that he thought Tesla's stock price was too high, it closed 10% lower than the day prior, landing him in more hot water with the SEC. On a Tuesday morning in January 2021, Musk was likely scrolling Etsy. ""I kinda love Etsy,"" he wrote in a post that received 280,000 likes. His four-word comment powered a temporary 8% stock surge for the e-commerce company known for selling vintage and handmade goods. In the early hours of a Friday morning in 2021, Musk added #bitcoin to his then-Twitter bio on the social platform and posted the message, ""In retrospect, it was inevitable."" The cryptocurrency Bitcoin soared nearly 20% in response after being relatively stable. The surge inspired a rise in Dogecoin's share price at the time as well, according to CNBC.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hot-credit-market-simple-fixed-111906547.html,"Wed, Nov 27, 2024, 3:19 AM","(Bloomberg) -- Credit investors squeezed by the tightest spreads in almost 20 years are opting for bare-bones strategies, creating a boom for Europe’s fixed-maturity funds. Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Italy’s Motor City, Car-Free Options Are Growing In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field NYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge These previously-niche funds invest mostly in investment-grade corporate bonds, offering investors a fixed annual yield and the return of their money at a set date. This straightforward pitch has become irresistible at a time when other sources of income, including risk premiums over government debt and more complicated bets on subordinated or higher-risk corporate bonds, are vanishing. Fixed-maturity funds in Europe with at least 50% allocation to corporate bonds now command close to €113 billion ($119 billion) of assets, based on data compiled by Morningstar Direct. That’s almost triple the amount they oversaw two years ago, with growth coming as the likes of BlackRock Inc. and M&G Plc pile in. They’re particularly popular with retail investors, though institutional money is also involved. “Over the last 18 months we have seen a massive rise in fixed maturity,” said Neal Brooks, global head of distribution and product at M&G Investments. “Interest rate policy has been slower than many predicted. Given a perception of higher-for-longer rates, spreads may be narrow but the yield is still attractive,” he said. M&G’s assets under management in fixed-maturity funds are set to approach €2 billion by the end of the year, up from zero before 2023. The funds are typically built during a ramp-up period of a few weeks, during which the manager packages a bundle of bonds with a similar maturity to the fund and investors subscribe to it. They’re sold via private banks and insurance companies and are designed to return the money invested once the last bonds mature. “It’s the yield and the simplicity of them that is attractive to clients,” said Simon Blundell, head of European fundamental fixed-income investments at BlackRock. “Whatever number you see will only be a part-representation as to the amount of money that been invested in this way over recent years.” Fixed-maturity funds started to become more popular a couple of years ago, when central bank interest-rate hikes caused a jump in bond yields. While that dynamic may be reversed at some point, with banks including the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank now cutting rates, the funds’ assets keep setting records. That’s because of pent-up demand for fixed maturity as investors waited for evidence that yields have peaked, according to BlackRock’s Blundell. And for investors, “it’s all relative,” according to Goldman Sachs credit analysts, who highlighted in a presentation last week that yields are historically high while spreads are historically tight. The average yield on Bloomberg’s global investment-grade corporate index is 150 basis points above its 10-year average, even after coming down from late 2023 highs. At the same time, relentless inflows into fixed-income assets and improved credit fundamentals have left spreads on the index near the lowest since 2007. “Fixed maturity funds have constituted a new investable sub-structure in the investment-grade universe that has been particularly successful in attracting retail money with the promise of juicy low-risk yields,” Deutsche Bank strategists including Steve Caprio wrote in a recent report. To be sure, investors in fixed-maturity funds risk missing out on big price rallies due to their bonds returning to face value by the time the fund matures. And there’s the added risk of yields in the market being much lower by the time they need to reinvest their money. Still, with little extra reward expected for more complicated trades, these simple yield-based strategies are likely to remain popular. “We think that investors will be incentivized to lock in the still relatively high yields on offer,” Bank of America credit strategists Ioannis Angelakis and Barnaby Martin wrote in a report.

Sales at its namesake stores are still declining, while other brands Free People and Anthropologie reported rising sales. Executives noted a ""remarkably resilient"" consumer in the quarter, but said store closures for the Urban Outfitters brand are likely in the coming years. Urban Outfitters (URBN) shares jumped Wednesday morning after the company reported third-quarter results better than analysts had expected, thanks to rising sales across its non-Urban Outfitters brands. On Tuesday, the retailer reported a third-quarter record of $1.36 billion in revenue, up from $1.28 billion the same time last year and slightly better than the $1.34 billion analysts had expected, according to estimates compiled by Visible Alpha. The operator of its namesake Urban Outfitters stores along with other brands like Free People and Anthropologie recorded $102.9 million in net income for the quarter, up from $83 million a year ago and the $78.9 million analysts projected. Overall comparable store sales rose 1.5% year-over-year, driven by 5.8% growth at Anthropologie stores and 5.3% at Free People, each better than expected, while comparable sales at Urban Outfitters fell more than expected at 8.9%. CEO Richard Hayne said the company is ""optimistic"" about demand the company is seeing ahead of the holiday shopping season, noting in Tuesday's earnings call that Urban Outfitters has seen a ""remarkably resilient"" consumer. Hayne said positive sales trends seen in October continued into the start of the fourth quarter in November despite outside events like global conflict, severe weather, and the election, according to a transcript of the call from AlphaSense. Last quarter, executives said sales had slowed at Urban Outfitters because of shifting consumer trends and the company failing to adapt to trends popular among younger consumers. Brand president Shea Jensen said in Tuesday's call that the company is ""actively evaluating"" the roughly half of its leases for Urban Outfitters stores that will be up over the next three years, and said some closures, downsizings, and relocations seem likely.

After clinching record highs on Tuesday, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was off about 0.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down more than 1%. The mood is muted in the wind-down to the Thanksgiving holiday, which will see markets shut on Thursday and close early on Friday. But the Fed is taking the fore again after being eclipsed somewhat by the debate over the impact of President-elect Donald Trump's tariff plans and Cabinet choices. The latest reading of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge showed price increases were flat in October from the prior month, raising questions over whether progress in getting to the central bank's 2% goal has stalled. The core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out food and energy costs and is closely watched by the central bank, rose 0.3% from the prior month during October, in line with Wall Street's expectations for 0.3% and the reading from September. Over the prior year, core prices rose 2.8%, in line with Wall Street's expectations but above the 2.7% seen in September. Traders currently see a roughly 34% chance the Fed holds rates steady at that meeting, up from about 24% a month before, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Also out Wednesday, the second estimate of third quarter GDP was unchanged, showing the US economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.8% in the period. Meanwhile, weekly jobless claims continued to move lower with 213,000 unemployment claims filed in the week ending Nov. 23, down from 215,000 the week prior. Trump on Tuesday tapped Jamieson Greer — a veteran of his first term — as US trade representative. Given Greer was heavily involved in Trump's original China tariffs, Wall Street is assessing what his role could mean for the big new tariffs promised for the US's top trading partners. On the corporate front, Dell (DELL) shares sank over 12% after quarterly revenue fell short amid flagging PC demand. Peer HP's (HPQ) stock also fell post-earnings, also down over 13%. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Fewer Americans are filing for unemployment benefits. But that doesn't mean companies are hiring. New data released by the Department of Labor on Wednesday showed that jobless claims hit a seven-month low in the week ending Nov. 23, with 213,000 initial claims filed. That's down from the 215,000 the week prior and below the 215,000 economists had expected. ""We are in a 'low-hire, low-fire' environment,"" Bank of America's lead economist Aditya Bhave said in a note on Tuesday. ""In the spring of 2022, there were two open jobs for every unemployed person. Now that figure is just a little more than one. In other words, there aren’t as many opportunities out there."" Recent data has supported that trend, confirming a gradual slowdown of the labor market. Job openings for the month of September fell to their lowest level since January 2021 while the quits rate, a sign of confidence among workers, also dropped to 1.9% from a revised 2% in August. In one bright spot, layoffs have remained low with the unemployment rate still hovering at a healthy 4.1%. ""A spike in layoffs would create a negative feedback loop between consumption and the labor market,"" Bank of America's Bhave said. ""For now though, the layoff rate is below pre- pandemic levels, consistent with the low level of unemployment insurance claims."" ""So while the labor market has moderated,"" Bhave said, ""It hasn’t rolled over!"" Read more here. Dell Technologies (DELL) shares dropped more than 13% early Wednesday after the company took a cautious approach to its forecast for investors while warning that AI growth ""will not be linear."" ""AI is a robust opportunity…and interest in our portfolio is an all-time high with no signs of slowing down,"" Dell COO Jeffrey Clarke said during a call with investors Tuesday night following the company's earnings report for the October period. ""That said, this business will not be linear, especially as customers navigate an underlying silicon road map that is changing."" Dell's AI server revenues fell 9% in the third quarter from the prior period. That nonlinear growth, coupled with a slower-than-expected recovery in the PC market, led the company to drop the midpoint of its guidance range for annual revenue to $96.1 billion from $97 billion since last quarter. Still, Dell executives and analysts pointed to pent-up demand for Dell's AI servers using Nvidia's (NVDA) latest Blackwell AI chips.

Another Wall Street strategist sees a solid backdrop for the US economy and a broadening corporate earnings picture driving stocks higher in the year ahead. JPMorgan's global equity strategy team led by Dubravko Lakos-Bujas sees the S&P 500 (^GSPC) hitting 6,500 by the end of 2025, joining the likes of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, who issued the same target. The target represents about an 8% increase from current levels. Lakos-Bujas wrote that continued ""US exceptionalism,"" continued earnings growth, and interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve will be a tailwind for stocks in the year ahead. He argued the US is likely to remain the ""global growth engine with the business cycle in expansion, healthy labor market, broadening of AI-related capital spending, and prospect of robust capital market and deal activity."" He added, ""heightened geopolitical uncertainty and the evolving policy agenda are introducing unusual complexity to the outlook, but opportunities are likely to outweigh risks. The benefit of deregulation and a more business-friendly environment are likely underestimated along with potential for unlocking productivity gains and capital deployment."" US stocks paused near record highs on Wednesday as investors waited for a reading on the Federal Reserve's favorite inflation gauge to provide clues to the path of interest rates. After clinching record highs on Tuesday, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell about 0.2% at the open while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.1%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was down about 0.3%. The October print of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, is due for release on Wednesday morning at 10 a.m. ET. The focus is on whether inflation has stalled. Economists expect annual ""core"" PCE — which excludes food and energy — to have clocked in at 2.8% in October, up from the 2.7% seen in September. Weekly jobless claims rose less than expected last week, and hit a seven-month low, as the impact of labor strikes and severe weather continued to abate. New data from the Department of Labor showed 213,000 initial jobless claims were filed in the week ending Nov. 23, down from the 215,000 the week prior and below the 215,000 economists had expected. Meanwhile, the number of continuing applications for unemployment benefits hit 1.9 million, up 9,000 from the week prior and the highest level since November 2021. Elsewhere in economic data, the second estimate of third quarter GDP came in unchanged, once again showing the US economy grew at annualized rate of 2.8%.

Fran Horowitz ""When we understand truly what's happening, we will have to make some adjustments, and we will adjust accordingly,It's exactly what we did in 2018 when we had the same challenge.

U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs on its trade partners sent nearly all major indexes into a tailspin, as his policies were expected to cut global growth as well as prospects for central bank interest rate cuts. Still, the benchmark U.S. S&P 500 index is up about 4% since the Nov. 5 election, suggesting that, while investors in the world's largest economy are so far fine with Trump's radically different approach to policy, there are risks aplenty for the rest. The Nov. 15-26 Reuters poll of more than 150 equity strategists covering 15 major stock indexes forecast only three would outperform their current year-to-date performance in 2025. ""There are two risks in particular that investors face as we approach 2025,"" noted analysts at Goldman Sachs. ""The first is that the recent wave of optimism has front-loaded returns, leaving them vulnerable to a correction. There are still many unknowns around tariff risks, for example, and the impact on global growth and inflation."" While the S&P 500's more than 25% rise this year was the highest among major equity indexes, it was mostly driven by a handful of technology stocks, suggesting there may be limited scope for a repeat performance. The U.S. benchmark stock index was expected to touch 6,147 by mid-2025 and then end the year at 6,500, gaining 2.7% and about 8.5% respectively from Monday's close. At a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 24 against a 10-year average of 18, the S&P 500 is already one of the world's most overvalued indexes. ""We are emerging from a highly unusual period in which one market (the U.S.) and one sector (technology) dominated returns - and within that sector, a handful of exceptional firms drove the large bulk of those returns,"" noted Justin Thomson, head of international equity at T. Rowe Price. ""This dominance has skewed investor positioning and valuations - many investor portfolios are heavily exposed to U.S. equities while virtually every sector in non‑U.S. equities is currently cheaper than its U.S. equivalent."" Among other developed market indexes, the pan-European STOXX 600 index is expected to rise to 536 points by end-2025, up more than 5% from Monday's close and above a record high of 528.68 touched in September. European indexes have lagged the U.S. this year, a trend likely to continue into 2025, despite presenting a buying opportunity in terms of relative value, the survey found. Only France's CAC 40, which is down nearly 4% for the year, was expected to recoup all of those losses and end next year about 9% higher from current levels. Brazil's BOVESPA and Mexico's IPC indexes, which were forecast to register double-digit gains in 2025, are down roughly 4.0% and 13.0% respectively this year. Those estimates were collected before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, said he would impose a 25% tariff on imports from Mexico until it clamped down on drugs and immigrants. India's richly-valued stocks were predicted to rise 4.7% by mid-2025 and 9.2% by end-2025, a relatively sluggish performance for the country's benchmark BSE Sensex which has shown double-digit gains in seven of the past 10 years, including this year. Despite the tempered outlook, a rare occurrence in a market where participants are mostly bullish, there was no clear consensus among analysts if a correction - a drop of 10% or more in stock prices - was in the offing in the near-term. Among 83 equity strategists who answered an additional question, 43 said a correction in their local markets by early next year was likely. The remaining 40 said it was unlikely.

A bearish divergence has formed between the stock's November peak and the relative strength index, a technical occurrence that signals weakening buying momentum. Investors should monitor important support areas on Workday's chart around $237, $223, and $207 while also watching a key overhead level near $279. Workday (WDAY) posted better-than-expected third-quarter results, but provided a current-quarter subscription revenue outlook below Wall Street expectations, sending shares in the human resources and finance software maker tumbling in early trading on Wednesday. In a post earnings call, chief finance officer Zane Rowe told analysts that the company continues to face more deal scrutiny than usual in some parts of the world. However, the company sees opportunities in the public sector as government agencies focus on driving economies of scale and improving efficiency. The stock was down 10% at around $243 in the opening minutes of Wednesday's trading session, pushing the year-to-date decline to 12%. Below, we take a closer look at Workday’s chart and use technical analysis to identify important price levels that investors may be watching. Since breaking out above a descending channel, Workday shares have formed two peaks on the chart between August and November. It’s worth pointing out that as the second peak made a higher high, the relative strength index (RSI) made a shallower high to create a bearish divergence, a technical occurrence that signals weakening buying momentum. Let’s analyze Workday’s chart to locate several important areas that may provide support amid earnings-driven selling and also discuss a key overhead level to watch if the stock makes a recovery. Firstly, investors should monitor the $237 area. This region could find support from a multi-month trendline that connects a range of comparable trading levels on the chart from July 2023 to October this year. The bulls' failure to defend this important technical level could see a fall to around $223, an area where the shares may attract buying interest near similar price points positioned roughly midway between the early September 2023 swing high and late October 2023 swing low. A more significant drop opens the door for a retest of lower support near $207. Investors could look for long-term buying opportunities in this area close to a horizontal line that links prominent troughs on the chart from October 2023 to June this year with the early August bear trap closing price. Amid a recovery in the stock’s price, investors should watch the $279 level. Those who have purchased shares below the 200-day moving average (MA) may look for exit points near the recent November peak, which also closely aligns with the December high and March countertrend top.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/airline-stocks-soar-as-demand-for-premium-travel-booms-135921918.html,"Wed, Nov 27, 2024, 5:59 AM","Major US airline stocks have soared in recent months as Wall Street grows more bullish on increased revenue from route expansions and growing demand for premium travel. Delta (DAL) and United (UAL) stocks hit all-time highs as the broader market rose in the days following Donald Trump’s White House victory. Year to date, Delta and United have gained 60% and 134%, respectively, handily beating the S&P 500's (^GSPC) gain of more than 25%. American (AAL) has gained roughly 6% during the same period while rallying more than 50% since August. Even shares of JetBlue (JBLU) and Frontier (ULCC) are positive for the year, despite failed consolidation attempts among the low-cost carrier players. Airline industry watchers see a strong end-of-the-year finish for Delta, United, and American, despite ongoing industry challenges such as higher maintenance costs, increased pilot wages signed into contracts last year, and new fleet restraints due to production issues at Boeing (BA). ""These challenges are showing Wall Street and the people who are savvy that, ‘Hey, these companies are well managed,’"" said Mike Boyd, president of aviation research and consulting company Boyd Group International. Air travel is expected to reach all-time high levels this Thanksgiving holiday. Starting Tuesday, Transportation Security Administration projects it will screen 18.3 million people over the next week, a 6% increase ""I think we're going to have a very strong end of the year for American, United, Delta — even Southwest … they’ve turned the corner,” Boyd said. Part of the reason for the big carriers' success has to do with increased demand for premium travel, which includes perks like extra legroom, refundable tickets, and early boarding. Analysts expect the higher margins from such offerings to boost earnings, which in turn could lift stocks. The growing trend of charging more for perks like advanced seating, window seats, and extra legroom and bags has drawn criticism from a US Senate panel led by Democratic Sen. Richard Blumenthal. The lawmaker announced a hearing with airline executives next Wednesday to discuss what he calls ""sky-high junk fees"" in the legislators' latest report. Delta expects premium ticket revenue to exceed main cabin sales by 2027. Delta laid out plans to expand its offering to high-net-worth travelers at its Investment Day last week, with the company expecting 85% of seats added in 2025 to be premium. ""That premium consumer is doing well,"" Delta CEO Ed Bastian said last Wednesday, pointing to millennials as the fastest-growing cohort in the travel spend category. Revenue growth from additional premium seats may help the airline meet or exceed its pre-pandemic average operating margin of 14%. “The demand and the interest to be up front and to be sitting in the seats with the various ways in which they can get there and pay for it is like never before,” Bastian added. American Airlines has said its premium revenue rose 8% year over year in the third quarter. The company plans to grow its higher-tier seats by about 20% over the next two years through 2026. ""As we take a look at in the future, I think that customers are looking to having a more premium experience, we're going to accommodate that they want more control,"" American CEO Robert Isom told analysts during the company's earnings call last month. Travelers are flocking to more expensive seating because of convenience and reliability, said M&N Aviation airline consultant Sebastian Domaradzki. “You get pre boarding, you get lounge access. The convenience of being able to change your light last minute without any fees ... that’s really important to the business traveler and the high net worth traveler,"" Domaradzki told Yahoo Finance. Domaradzki also sees the main carriers benefiting from the recent Chapter 11 filing of low-cost carrier Spirit after its attempts to tie up with JetBlue or Frontier failed to materialize. “People want to be able to know they can get to where they need to get to without needing to worry about the financial performance of the airline and whether their ticket will be valid a few weeks from now,"" Domaradzki said. Low-cost carriers have been hit hard over the past year as travelers have opted for more international trips, and stiff domestic competition has made it hard to raise prices to offset rising maintenance costs and salaries. Bigger carriers like United have been increasing their market share via more domestic routes. Last week TD Cowen's Tom Fitzgerald picked United as a Best Idea of 2025, based on its ""domestic share gains, increasing corporate traffic, and maturing international routes."" The analyst raised his price target on the stock to $125 from $100. ""The outlook for the broader industry has materially improved since mid-year due to substantial decreases in domestic capacity and fuel prices, as well as macroeconomic demand that looks to remain resilient in 2025,"" he wrote.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/landmark-fish-meat-markets-london-144955547.html,"Wed, Nov 27, 2024, 6:49 AM","LONDON (AP) — Two of London's most famous markets — one selling fish, the other meat — are set to close in the coming years, bringing an end to traditions stretching back to medieval times. On Wednesday, the City of London Corporation, the governing body in the capital city's historic hub, is set to present a bill to Parliament to bring an end to its responsibilities to operate the Billingsgate fish market and the Smithfield meat market, both of which have existed in some shape or form since the 11th century. That comes a day after the corporation decided not to relocate the markets to a new development just east of London in Dagenham. It abandoned the planned move because of the growing expense, both as a result of the recent bout of inflation and an increase in construction costs — at around 1 billion pounds ($1.25 billion), as things stand. Instead, under a new agreement with market traders, the corporation will provide financial compensation and advice. The traders have a bit of time to work out what to do, with operations continuing until at least 2028. “This decision represents a positive new chapter for Smithfield and Billingsgate Markets in that it empowers Traders to build a sustainable future in premises that align with their long-term business goals,"" said Chris Hayward, the policy chairman of the City of London Corporation. “By stepping back from direct market operations, we will help to create opportunities for these businesses to thrive independently.” The traders will now work out how to relocate to wherever they wish to in London, potentially on their own or within groups. No doubt, wherever they end up, their place of work will be shiny and new. But it will be lacking in tradition. At Smithfield, the market traders typically begin work at 10 p.m., selling mainly to the restaurant trade, and finish up at about 6 a.m., just as the rest of the city is waking up. Pubs around the market traditionally had special licenses allowing them to open in the early hours of the morning to serve the traders. Peter Ackroyd, who wrote the seminal “London: The Biography” in 2000, said the Billingsgate fish market has its roots in the early 11th century, before William the Conqueror turned up with his Norman troops in England to bring an end to Saxon times. Smithfield, built just beyond the old Roman wall, became the go-to place for the sale of horses, sheep and cattle later that century. Ackroyd describes how, for hundreds of years, Smithfield and Billingsgate, as well as other markets selling flowers, fruit and vegetables, and poultry, were woven into the fabric of London life, though often known for drunkenness, general rowdiness and violence. The great British author Charles Dickens described Smithfield, for example, as a center of “filth and mire,” referencing the market in both ”Oliver Twist"" and “Great Expectations.” With the advent of food standards and regular rebuilds, the markets are clearly not as squalid as they were in medieval times. But another costly rebuilding was looming. Smithfield's buildings date from Victorian times, with some modifications, and suffered a major fire in 1958, while Billingsgate has been at its current site in London Docklands since 1982, a district that was then derelict but is now home to the gleaming towers of the Canary Wharf financial district. There are proposals to build 4,000 much-needed new houses at the Billingsgate site, while Smithfield is set to become a cultural center and will house the new London Museum.

The so-called Second Financing for the Future Act is intended in particular to improve the tax framework for investments in venture capital, while obstacles to investment in infrastructure and renewable energies are to be removed and bureaucracy reduced. The draft, seen by Reuters, states it would offer tax relief for companies of 45 million euros ($47.37 million) per year. However, it is questionable whether the current minority government will find a majority for the law to be approved in the two houses of parliament before the new election on Feb. 23. The act was largely drawn up by former finance minister and leader of the Free Democrats Christian Lindner, which is why his party might be inclined to support the plan in parliament even after Chancellor Olaf Scholz fired him, paving the way for the snap elections. The project is one of the 49 measures from the government's growth initiative that is meant to strengthen Germany as a business location and boost anaemic economic growth.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ionq-form-ibm-stocks-buys-172250459.html,"Wed, Nov 27, 2024, 9:22 AM","Quantum computing promises to revolutionize the way we process information by leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics. It will offer unprecedented computational power, enabling solutions to complex problems that are currently unsolvable by classical computers. This breakthrough technology has the potential to transform industries such as cryptography, drug discovery, and artificial intelligence. IonQ Inc (IONQ), FormFactor (FORM), and IBM (IBM) are among the stocks offering exposure to this potentially explosive sector. Unlock your investing potential with TipRanks Premium - Now At 40% OFF! Make smarter investments with weekly expert stock picks from the Smart Investor Newsletter However, despite the huge potential of this sector, I’m neutral on FormFactor—a semiconductor company with profitable exposure to quantum computing—bearish on IonQ—a surging, pure-play quantum stock—and bearish on tech giant IBM. But first, what is a quantum computer? Well, it leverages quantum mechanics, which describes the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic levels. There are two concepts that underpin the potential use of quantum mechanics: superposition and quantum entanglement. Quantum computers are different from the computers we use today because they use quantum bits (qubits) instead of bits—the most basic unit of information in computing and digital communication. Qubits, unlike normal bits, can be in multiple states at one time. This is known as superposition and enables quantum computers to process vast amounts of information in parallel. Entanglement, on the other hand, is when two qubits become linked and cannot be described independently, regardless of distance. It’s as if the qubits are connected by an invisible thread, allowing instantaneous communication. Albert Einstein called it “spooky action at a distance.” These phenomena enable quantum computers to perform complex calculations exponentially faster than classical computers for certain problems. The issue is that the technology simply isn’t there yet, and some people believe we will never truly be able to harness the power of quantum mechanics for computing. These three companies, IonQ, FormFactor, and IBM, offer varying levels and types of exposure to quantum technology. Let’s explore. IonQ is the pure play on quantum technology, specializing in trapped ion quantum computing. The stock has surged over the last month, but unfortunately, I’m bearish on this one. The valuation appears too high, given the execution risk. Trapped ion quantum computing uses individual ions suspended in a vacuum as qubits, offering several advantages over other quantum computing technologies, such as high fidelity, long coherence times, and precise control. The firm is looking to dominate in quantum networking — a field that could be worth $38 billion by 2040. As noted above, IonQ leverages superposition and entanglement to transfer data between quantum processors that are physically separated. Interestingly, the company has achieved some notable breakthroughs, including recording 99.9% fidelity on two-qubit gates using barium ions. The firm has also demonstrated ion-photon entanglement for commercial use and ion-ion entanglement. In turn, this has led to major deals and partnerships, including a $54.5 million contract with the U.S. Air Force Research Lab and year-to-date bookings of $72.8 million. As a result of its deals and progress, IonQ stock has surged 156% over 12 months. However, I’m concerned that the stock is overbought. The company’s market cap has now exceeded $6 billion despite a revenue forecast of just $315 million by the end of 2027. Moreover, IonQ is expected to operate at a loss throughout the period. It also does not help that the company’s price-to-book (P/B) ratio is the highest among its competitors. The current valuation introduces a high degree of execution risk in what remains a commercially unproven field of technology. It’s also a field that requires plenty of investment, and it’s facing competition from major tech companies with comparatively bottomless pockets. So, despite the huge promise, I’m bearish on IonQ purely because its valuation seems disproportionate at this moment in time. On TipRanks, IONQ comes in as a Strong Buy based on three Buys, one Hold, and zero Sells assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average IONQ stock price of $19.23 implies 40% downside from current levels. See more IONQ analyst ratings I’m neutral on FormFactor, a prominent player in the semiconductor industry, because it appears to be trading broadly in line with growth expectations. FormFactor provides critical test and measurement technologies that span the entire lifecycle of chipsets, offering a wide range of products, including probe cards, analytical probes, probe stations, metrology systems, and cryogenic systems. Recently, FormFactor has ventured into the exciting field of quantum computing through its collaboration with Tabor Electronics and QuantWare. The Echo-5Q, a full-stack 5-qubit quantum computer designed for research and education, integrates FormFactor’s advanced cryogenic technology with QuantWare’s high-performance quantum processing units, resulting in a 250% improvement in T1 relaxation times compared to similar systems. As such, analysts see the quantum sector as a tailwind for this semiconductor company. The stock could be an unconventional play on quantum computing, with the company already seeing profitable sales in the quantum computing sector. However, for now, at least, its quantum offering is still in its early stages. Looking at FORM stock more broadly, it trades at relatively high multiples (35.4x forward earnings) – a 40% premium to the information technology segment. The price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 1.78, despite being at a 7% discount to the sector, doesn’t fill me with confidence. For now, at least, I’m neutral. Furthermore, on TipRanks, FORM comes in as a Moderate Buy based on three Buys, three Holds, and zero Sells assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average FORM stock price of $53 implies 32% upside from current levels. See more FORM analyst ratings The final stock I’m looking at today is IBM, a global leader in technology and innovation, and unfortunately, I’m also bearish. The company has been at the forefront of quantum computing development for some time, but the stock is overvalued relative to its expected growth. As part of its strategic focus, IBM has invested heavily in quantum research and development, positioning itself as a key player in the rapidly evolving quantum landscape. One of IBM’s most significant milestones is the development of a 1,121-qubit chip known as the IBM Quantum Condor. This marked a substantial leap in qubit capacity. The company had ambitious plans, including commercializing 1,000-qubit computers in the near future and developing a 10,000-qubit quantum computer. In addition to broader efforts in the field, the company’s open-source Qiskit framework facilitates collaboration and innovation within the quantum community, further solidifying its role as a pioneer in the field. IBM doesn’t detail how much it spends on quantum computing research. However, it’s undoubtedly among the largest investors in this new technology. Its existing achievements, coupled with deep pockets, undoubtedly position it well to lead in the quantum era. However, I’m concerned by IBM’s valuation despite its quantum potential. The stock trades at 21.8x forward earnings, a 13% discount versus the sector average, but has a PEG ratio of 4.4 – a 129% premium to the sector. In short, since the stock looks overvalued versus its earnings forecasts, I can’t help but be bearish. On TipRanks, IBM comes in as a Moderate Buy based on five Buys, seven Holds, and one Sell assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average IBM stock price of $229.75 implies 1% upside from current levels. See more IBM analyst ratings Sadly, none of these stocks currently scream buy to me. However, quantitive metrics, which I tend to favor, can be prone to missing new opportunities in emerging sectors. Nonetheless, my feeling is that these companies are still some distance away from truly commercializing quantum systems and that makes it challenging to invest today, given the execution risk.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earn-500-month-apple-stock-141158997.html,"Wed, Nov 27, 2024, 6:11 AM","Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares closed slightly higher on Tuesday. Apple is reportedly changing its approach to software updates. The tech giant appears to be opting for staggered rollouts of new features instead of bundling everything into annual iOS releases. In his latest weekly “Power On” newsletter, Bloomberg columnist Mark Gurman said that Cupertino plans a significant update with iOS 18.4 this spring. With the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends too. As of now, Apple offers an annual dividend yield of 0.43%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 25 cents per share ($1.00 a year). So, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly? To earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $1,410,360 or around 6,000 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $282,072 or around 1,200 shares. To calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($1.00 in this case). So, $6,000 / $1.00 = 6,000 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $1.00 = 1,200 shares ($100 per month). Note that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time. How that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock’s current price. For example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40). Similarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield. AAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple gained 0.9% to close at $235.06 on Tuesday.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/french-borrowing-costs-surge-above-130935081.html,"Wed, Nov 27, 2024, 5:09 AM","French borrowing costs have soared and the country’s stock market has slumped, as investors take fright at political chaos and mounting debts. Five-year borrowing costs climbed to 2.7pc on Wednesday, more than the rate paid by the Greek government at 2.5pc. French 10-year bond yields are also only slightly lower than Greece’s. A year ago, Paris’s borrowing costs were comfortably below Athens on both measures. French stocks also plunged on Wednesday, with the benchmark Cac 40 index down 1.2pc by lunchtime. Investors are dumping French assets amid concerns about political instability. Marine Le Pen’s far-Right National Rally party is threatening to bring down the government in a row over the budget. Michel Barnier, the prime minister, is trying to raise taxes and restrain spending with the aim of reducing borrowing to 5pc of GDP next year. The French government is poised to run a budget deficit equivalent to more than 6pc of GDP this year despite efforts to move the finances closer to the black. Mr Barnier is running a minority government following President Emmanuel Macron’s unsuccessful bid to boost his authority with a snap election earlier this year, meaning the administration is highly vulnerable to a rebellion. A rise in borrowing costs piles yet more pressure on France’s finances. National debt is projected to rise from just over 110pc of GDP last year to 113.8pc next year. Loredana Maria Federico, economist at UniCredit, said there was a growing risk that ructions in bond markets could spread to the wider economy, “particularly if the current government were to face a no-confidence motion”. She said: “Investors remain concerned about political developments in France, especially due to the government’s difficulties in approving next year’s budget.” At the same time, investors are increasingly worried about the impact of Donald Trump’s threatened tariffs on Europe. Analysts at Barclays said: “Europe is expected to be one of the main losers of ‘America first’ policies, and unsurprisingly we’ve seen outflows from the region tick back up since the election. Most investors seem willing to allocate their next investment dollar to the US over Europe for the foreseeable future.” Greek borrowing costs were stratospheric for years after its sovereign debt crisis and a series of bailouts, while France – judged by investors to be far less risky – benefitted from its status as a “core” eurozone nation and so paid a much lower interest rate. However, now Greece is deemed to be increasingly reliable as it gets its debts under control, while the French government is struggling to reduce its level of annual borrowing.

Investors were grappling with fresh U.S. inflation data and its implications for Federal Reserve policy along with continued fallout from Donald Trump's tariff pledges as trading in the U.S. was thinning out ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday. Asian markets were waking up to a tepid day for U.S. equities, with technology shares leading major indexes lower. Shares of Dell and HP sank after weak forecasts from the personal computer makers, weighing on the tech sector. Data showed the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index -- an inflation gauge followed by the Fed -- rose 2.3% in the 12 months through October, a slight uptick from the prior month. Traders were still expecting another interest rate cut when the Fed meets in mid-December, with Fed futures showing that expectations of a 25 basis point reduction remained intact following the PCE data. Investors were trying to sort through the potential fallout from Trump's pledge earlier this week of big tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, which has rattled assets including currencies and auto shares. For example, Goldman Sachs economists estimated the tariffs, if implemented, would increase U.S. core PCE inflation by 0.9%. Meanwhile, Mexico's president warned the country would retaliate if Trump followed through with his 25% across-the-board tariff, a move her government warned could kill 400,000 U.S. jobs. With tariffs as a continued specter, major Asian indexes posted mixed sessions on Wednesday. Japan's Nikkei ended lower, with automakers leading the losses, amid concerns about the impact of Trump's tariff plans and a stronger yen. But key China equity gauges gained more than 1%, as data showed a less sharp decline in the country's industrial profits and traders bet that Beijing will provide stimulus to counter risks from the U.S. tariffs. In India, a Reuters poll of equity analysts found that equity markets will take time to recover from their recent sell-off because they remain overvalued, with last week's Adani indictments only adding to the pain. Beyond the U.S., central bank policy was in focus elsewhere globally. New Zealand's central bank cut rates on Wednesday for a third time in four months, and flagged more substantial easing. The Bank of Korea is up next. The BOK is expected to keep its key policy rate at 3.25% on Thursday to support the Korean won against a strong U.S. dollar, according to a Reuters poll of economists, who forecast at least three rate cuts next year. The end of the week is expected to bring more eventful data in Asia, with GDP figures due in India and Taiwan on Friday, along with Tokyo CPI data. ""Black Friday"" -- the day after Thanksgiving -- also marks the unofficial start of U.S. holiday shopping season. The extent to which inflation-challenged shoppers flock to deals will be of interest to markets, with consumer spending making up more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/jpmorgan-turns-positive-us-stocks-163829809.html,"Wed, Nov 27, 2024, 8:38 AM","(Bloomberg) -- JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s equity strategy team, led for years by Marko Kolanovic until his departure earlier in 2024, has turned positive on US stocks. Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Italy’s Motor City, Car-Free Options Are Growing In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field In Traffic-Weary Toronto, a Battle Breaks Out Over Bike Lanes Under Kolanovic, who had been bearish since late 2022 and whose exit JPMorgan announced in July, the bank kept its target for the S&P 500 Index pinned at 4,200 for almost two years. That was even as the US equities benchmark blew past that level in 2023 and climbed above 6,000 this year, and as Wall Street peers rushed to upgrade their outlooks. Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, who took over market research for the firm this summer, on Wednesday released a year-end 2025 target of 6,500, which eclipses the average projection of about 6,300 among strategists tracked by Bloomberg. JPMorgan’s new forecast implies an advance of roughly 8% from Tuesday’s close around 6,022. Lakos-Bujas based his bullish estimate on expectations for a healthy labor market, interest-rate cuts and a capital-expenditure boom in the race to capture the lead in artificial-intelligence technology, among other tailwinds. “Heightened geopolitical uncertainty and the evolving policy agenda are introducing unusual complexity to the outlook, but opportunities are likely to outweigh risks,” Lakos-Bujas wrote Wednesday in a note to clients. The view marks a notable reversal from the warnings coming from JPMorgan strategists for much of the past two years. Entering 2024, the group cautioned that they expected an economic slowdown would pressure corporate earnings. They also said that rich valuations, crowded positioning and low volatility made stocks “very vulnerable.” Instead, the S&P 500 is up about 26% in 2025. It’s on track to deliver two consecutive years of gains eclipsing 20% for the first time this century as a strong economy, AI enthusiasm, and monetary easing propel share prices. The shift in views removes JPMorgan as one of few remaining contrarians on Wall Street. For the year ahead, forecasts from major banks and analysts are bullish and clustered: Predictions from Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Morgan Stanley, and Bank of America Corp. fall around the 6,600 level, with estimates going as high as 7,000 from Deutsche Bank AG and Yardeni Research. But the optimism comes with US stocks at a crossroads as the S&P 500 trades at more than 22 times projected 12-month earnings, compared with an average reading of 18 in the last decade. There’s also the worry that President-elect Donald Trump’s promised policies, from tariffs to the mass deportation of workers, could reignite inflation and push up bond yields, weighing on equities. “The timing, scope, and multi-order effects of policy actions and executive orders remain considerable unknown levers for earnings,” Lakos-Bujas said in his outlook. But despite the risk of “extremely disruptive policies and the downside risk to equities they could pose,” Trump’s focus on markets, Federal Reserve rate cuts and stimulus efforts from China should place a floor under the market. In other expectations for 2025, JPMorgan strategists say the Trump administration’s energy agenda presents downside risks to oil prices from deregulation and increased US production, while stronger capital-markets activity is likely on lower rates and a more favorable regulatory backdrop. At the sector level, JPMorgan recommends being overweight financials, communications services and utilities; underweight energy and consumer discretionary; and neutral on the six remaining S&P 500 sectors. From a regional standpoint, the bank prefers US equities over European and emerging-market stocks, and stays overweight Japanese equities, which it says stand to benefit from improving real wage growth, accelerating buybacks and continued corporate reforms.

What you don't know about Medicare could cost you a fortune, says Melinda Caughill, the co-founder of 65 Incorporated. In a recent interview for the Decoding Retirement podcast at the 2024 Schwab Impact event (see video above or listen below), Caughill outlined some ""dirty little secrets"" about Medicare that every current and future beneficiary should know, from the importance of double-checking information from Social Security agents to reviewing your coverage each year. Here are some of the potential pitfalls in the Medicare system Caughill highlighted. Caughill explained Medicare enrollment as a six-step process that goes beyond merely selecting specific insurance providers like UnitedHealth (UNH), Humana (HUM), or Aetna. The initial step is to decide the timing of enrollment, which is dependent on individual needs, such as whether to enroll at age 65 or delay enrollment. The next step is to choose the type of Medicare coverage that best suits one's needs. This is often referred to as selecting a ""path,"" since it can be a one-way decision with no turning back. Read more: Medicare open enrollment: How to add or adjust your coverage After determining the timing and path, individuals should select specific insurance plans. Enrollment in Medicare is then completed through the Social Security Administration, followed by enrolling in any additional coverage. However, the process does not end there. The final step involves reviewing and potentially adjusting one’s coverage annually to ensure it continues to meet personal needs and circumstances. ""The sixth step of Medicare enrollment is reviewing your coverage each and every year for the rest of your life,"" Caughill said. ""No autopilot."" Failing to review coverage means you’re essentially giving insurance companies a blank check. And “just because you haven't experienced any changes to your health or medications” doesn’t mean your health plan will remain the same year after year, Caughill said. Premiums, deductibles, out-of-pocket copays, provider networks, and more can change each year, all while keeping the same plan name, she said. When you contact the Social Security Administration (SSA) to enroll in Medicare, you may not only find it difficult to get helpful advice, but you also risk receiving incorrect information. For example, Caughill told the story of David, an individual who had employer-paid COBRA health insurance through October. In January of that year, David called the Social Security Administration and asked the agent whether he needed to enroll in Medicare. According to Caughill, the Social Security agent advised David to enroll in Part A but to wait until October to enroll in Part B, just before Nov. 1. Unfortunately, this advice was incorrect and had devastating consequences. According to Medicare.gov, if you have COBRA and you’re eligible but not enrolled in Medicare, COBRA may only pay for a small portion of the healthcare services you receive, leaving you to pay most of the costs yourself. “It's really, really unfortunate that they got this guidance because, the truth is, when you have COBRA coverage after the age of 65, COBRA coverage is secondary to Medicare regardless of whether you get enrolled in Medicare or not,” Caughill noted. David incurred between $800,000 and $1 million in medical bills over the next 10 months. Due to the Social Security agent's guidance, these expenses were not covered, leaving him and his wife, Julia, without the necessary coverage. When Julia contacted the Social Security office to report receiving incorrect guidance, she was told there wasn’t enough information about the January call to review her case. ""The Social Security office said, 'Well, I'm so sorry, we'd love to help you, but we ... don't know who this employee was who helped you. So you're on your own,'"" according to Caughill. When dealing with SSA and Medicare, Caughill advised documenting any conversations with authorities, noting the date, time, what was said, and who you spoke with. If things go wrong, she said, you must prove that you got bad advice. And even then, it's hard to get relief. “Even with full documentation, it can be difficult, if not impossible, to get Social Security to make things right,” Caughill said. “But if you don't have any documentation at all, you've got no case.” There are two paths to choose from when enrolling in Medicare, Caughill explained. One can enroll in Medicare Advantage, or what some call Medicare Part C, or enroll in original Medicare and purchase a Medicare Supplement Insurance or Medigap plan. ""The sad thing,"" Caughill said, is that Medicare insurance agents are paid much more to sell you a Medicare Advantage plan than a Medigap policy. In fact, she noted that Medicare insurance agents make 40% more on the initial commission selling Medicare Advantage plans than Medigap plans. On average, they make $705 in commissions per Medicare Advantage plan, versus $483 per Medigap plan sold. Over the course of 20 years, a Medicare insurance agent will earn $7,765 in commissions per Medicare Advantage plan sold compared to $3,381 per Medigap plan sold. This does not mean Medicare Advantage plans or insurance agents are “bad,” Caughill noted in her presentation at Schwab Impact 2024. It just means that the business of Medicare insurance sales incentivizes agents to promote one type of product over another, regardless of what may actually be in the consumer’s best interest. “You need to know this,” Caughill said. “Always know where the money is going, and make sure that the guidance you're getting is in your best.” To find an agent who truly puts your needs first, Caughill suggested asking agents a few questions: Do they sell Medicare Advantage, Part D, and Medigap policies? What is their sales ratio of Medicare Advantage vs. Medigap policies? and how many companies are they allowed to sell? Caughill also advised people to pay attention during the sales conversation. Does the agent prioritize discussions about low monthly premiums and extra free benefits? (Not good.) Does the agent talk about today only, stating that you can always change your coverage later on? (Not good.) Or does the agent talk about provider networks, medication formularies, prior authorization, and guaranteed issue rights? (Good.) “There are good insurance agents out there,” she said. “There are also bad ones. ... So you need to ask those questions. And if you ask those questions and you find a good one, by all means, work with them.” The Inflation Reduction Act limits annual out-of-pocket drug expenses to $2,000. However, this cap only applies if the medications are included in your Part D drug plan, said Caughill. If a medication is not covered by your Part D plan, the $2,000 limit does not apply, and you will be responsible for paying the full retail price, regardless of whether it's $200 or $20,000 per month. “You will pay the full retail price for that medication,” she said. Caughill said it's also important to note that drug plans can change their formularies, or the list of medications they cover, each year, meaning a drug covered this year might not be covered next year.

The company reported 20% weight loss from the drug MariTide in patients after 52 weeks in a phase II study. By comparison, current market leaders Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO) have products that provide weight loss between 14% and 24%. Analysts on an investor call with Amgen Tuesday morning characterized the data as ""in line"" with the currently available products. A key difference in the data is less serious side effects, such as nausea and vomiting, over time compared to the Lilly and Novo products, which means the tolerability of the drug for patients will be greater — in addition to the added convenience of administering the drug just once a month. The study looked at a steady increase in doses over time, in both diabetics and those without type 2 diabetes who were overweight. Weight loss did not plateau, Amgen said, which has encouraged the company to pursue studying the drug's long-term potential as a ""maintenance"" drug, with a longer period between each dose. The study already began looking at the difference between three options: a monthly dosage, a twice-monthly dosage, and a quarterly dosage. That could reduce the burden of taking the drug from current once-weekly injectables and has been viewed as a game changer for the burgeoning weight-loss market. But the data revealed Tuesday didn't impress Wall Street. Mizuho's healthcare sector expert Jared Holz said that, on the surface, the data would draw more interest, but because Amgen is late to the weight-loss market — with a phase III trial still needed — it is at a disadvantage. In addition, ""AMGN did not disclose which dose it plans to move forward, but would guess that the higher doses are driving better weight loss so need to consider how the side effect profile looks in these specific formulations,"" Holz wrote in a note to clients. Amgen's stock was down more than 11% in premarket trading on the news, with shares trading at $260.

Joseph Spak at UBS noted that Tesla stock has surged around 40% since the election, adding over $350 billion to its market cap. While some of President-elect Donald Trump's policy proposals could favor Tesla, there are some policy negatives as well that would hurt fundamentals more than where the theoretical upside has taken the stock. “The rise in Tesla stock is mostly driven by animal spirits/momentum (which has happened multiple times in TSLA’s history),” Spak wrote. Tesla stock is down around 1% in midday trade, coming after Spak and UBS reiterated a rare Sell rating with a price target hike, to $226 from $197, for Tesla. Investors took Tesla stock to multiyear highs following Trump’s election win, mainly on the back of CEO Elon Musk’s full-throated endorsement of Trump. In return, Trump has unofficially placed Musk in his inner circle, allowed him to sit in on policy meetings, and named him to run a government efficiency council. Trump has also said his view on electric vehicles has improved due to Musk’s presence, though reports from the transition team claim the federal EV tax credit could be on the chopping block. While the removal of tax credits could hurt Tesla’s competitors more than Tesla itself, the calculation is not that simple. “The removal of consumer tax credits is not an absolute positive for US EV (and TSLA) demand. TSLA may have some new models/refreshes on the way which could help. But, we've seen pricing action (not including tax credits) only stabilize demand. So if credits go away, further pricing actions may be needed,” Spak wrote. The other bullish outcome for Tesla from Trump’s win is a more friendly regulatory environment, especially for Tesla’s robotaxi rollout. While there is a view that an easier regulatory “hurdle” is positive for Tesla’s robotaxi service, there is tempered by the fact that there really aren't any onerous federal autonomous vehicle regulations to ""relax,"" Spak wrote, as the bigger issues are dealt with on a state-by-state basis. In fact, the bigger robotaxi challenge could be the technology itself. “A change in regulation doesn't immediately solve, nor change the timeline to solve, the technological challenge of unsupervised [Full Self-Driving],” Spak wrote. “We continue to believe that FSD is improving, but the product is not ready for wide scale robotaxi deployment.” As for the hike with his price target, Spak said stock is essentially at his prior upside case valuation, and using the bank’s 57 times forward 2026 price-earnings ratio nets a $226 price target which is well below the current stock price. Spak isn’t here to pour cold water on Tesla’s recent monster move. He just isn’t buying it from a fundamental point of view, especially over the long run. For Tesla and its 40% rally in less than a month, that often doesn’t matter. “From a narrative perspective, especially if one were valuation agnostic, we get it,” Spak said.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thanksgiving-dinner-offers-a-glimpse-into-how-were-doing-on-inflation-173220050.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 9:32 AM","Count your blessings: Thanksgiving dinner is cheaper again this season. That marks the second year in a row the price of the meal retreated from its 2022 high. The average cost is $58.08 for 10 people, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation's (AFBF) study, which dates back 39 years. The total price is down 5% from last year and is 4.5% lower than in 2022, when the supper commemorating the 1621 harvest feast with the Pilgrims and the Wampanoag people soared to a peak of $64.02. The survey's cornucopia of goods includes turkey, stuffing, sweet potatoes, rolls, peas, cranberries, a veggie tray, and pumpkin pie with whipped cream. AFBF's expanded menu — which also consists of boneless ham, russet potatoes, and frozen green beans — increases the overall cost by $19.26. Despite the budget-friendly price tag, the dinner is still 19% higher than in 2019, illustrating how actual prices are still ruffling Americans' feathers. ""We've had two back-to-back declines, but this isn't quite enough to erase the dramatic increases that we saw,"" Bernt Nelson, an AFBF economist, told Yahoo Finance. ""And I think that speaks to inflation as a whole. We're seeing inflation come down, but what's key to remember is we're measuring the rate of growth slowing."" ""That doesn't mean we're going down in prices."" The biggest factor carving down Thanksgiving meal costs is the turkey, the traditional centerpiece that makes up 44.2% of the 10-person dinner. This year, the price of a 16-pound bird didn’t just increase at a slower rate — it actually dropped 6% to $25.67, or $1.60 per pound, from $27.35, or $1.71 per pound, in 2023. The reason for the decline is complicated. At first glance, you'd think prices would have taken flight this year because a widespread, years-long bird flu decimated the supply of the holiday fowl. The number of birds raised this year was at the lowest level since 1985. (The flu has also been responsible for the run-up in egg prices.) But our appetite for the wattled bird has flagged even more this year. Per capita demand for turkey fell one pound to 13.9 pounds per person this year, the AFBF report said, citing US Department of Agriculture data. The USDA report ""doesn't have a specific breakdown for lunch meat versus a frozen bird, so it's a little tricky to see exactly where the demand is dropping off,"" Nelson said. Prices of other Thanksgiving ingredients were trimmed even more percentage-wise. Three pounds of sweet potatoes, part of the bigger menu, cost 26.2% less this year, while whole milk fell 14.3% year over year — thanks to favorable weather for cows and their feedstuff. Other price declines to be grateful for include: 1 pound of frozen peas, down 8.1% 1-pound veggie tray, down 6.4% 30-ounce can of pumpkin pie mix, down 6.5 And two frozen pie crusts, down 2.9% Other ingredients are going for a bounty compared with last year. A dozen dinner rolls cost 8.4% more versus 2023, while you'll shell out 8.2% more for 14 ounces of cubed stuffing mix. Those increases all come down to wages, Nelson said, which are up around 3.8% to 4% across the country. ""These [items] require a little bit more hands-on labor,"" he said, ""and that increases the labor cost and that trickles down to the cost of the final products."" The biggest price increase came from fresh cranberries, which jumped 12%. But that's only after prices plummeted 18% last year because of a very good production season. Prices now for the berry are still more affordable than historical norms, the AFBF said, and when adjusted for inflation, this year's price is the lowest since 1987. In fact, adjusting for inflation, this year's Thanksgiving feast is the least expensive since 1985 when the survey began, aside from the outlier in 2020 during the height of the pandemic, according to the AFBF. Read more: 6 creative holiday savings tips to keep your budget in check this year Overall, the growth in grocery prices has slowed considerably and was only up 1.1% in October. And considering the growth in wages following the pandemic, including this year's 4% gain, it took 9% less work time to pay for this year’s Thanksgiving dinner. ""When we see these periods of high growth, we see the cost of these things go up and that comes from wage growth,"" Nelson said. ""It comes from a strong economy overall."" Still, Americans continue to feel lousy about inflation, even as the overall rate of price increases approaches the Federal Reserve's ideal target. And those lingering feelings are souring their holiday gathering just a little. A recent survey of 2,050 US adults from LendingTree found that 60% of folks hosting Thanksgiving say that inflation is going to have an impact. They plan to spend $431 on average for food, drinks, and decor — up 19% from last year — which is a financial strain for more than a third of them. ""That's a lot of money when you're talking about how expensive life already is,"" said Matt Schulz, LendingTree chief credit analyst and author of “Ask Questions, Save Money, Make More: How to Take Control of Your Financial Life.” To compensate, over a quarter of hosts plan to change their food choices or coupon more, while others expect a helping hand from their guests. Three in 5 hosts believe guests should offer money or an item to offset costs, and if they don't, 25% of hosts may withhold an invitation for next year. ""Inflation is still playing a really big part in what people are doing around Thanksgiving,"" Schulz said. ""It just makes it all the more necessary for people hosting to do what they can to turn it into a potluck where they get everybody involved"" — capturing the spirit of that original harvest feast. — Janna Herron is a Senior Columnist at Yahoo Finance.

At least not yet. Abercrombie & Fitch delivered another big earnings beat on Tuesday as its namesake division continued to resonate with young adults. The upside surprise came from the value-focused Hollister division — a business that is only now turning the corner amid new product introductions such as college-themed apparel. “Hollister is back,” Abercrombie & Fitch CEO Fran Horowitz told Yahoo Finance. Abercrombie & Fitch stock fell about 5% on Tuesday as sales results at the Abercrombie division only matched elevated analyst estimates. Still, Citi analyst Paul Lejuez called the quarter ""strong"" in a note to clients. The Street may also have been concerned that the company's inventory growth outpaced sales growth going into a holiday shopping season where consumers continue to spend cautiously. Horowitz said the holiday season has started ""strong."" Fresh potential tariffs on China that President-elect Trump floated late Monday also appeared to be weighing on investor sentiment. Abercrombie operates stores in China and sources apparel from the country. Trump proposed an additional 10% tariff on all products from China, contending the country was shipping illegal drugs to the US. CEOs such as Brooks Running' Dan Sheridan said tariffs could hammer the apparel industry on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast. Former longtime Gap and J Crew CEO Mickey Drexler echoed that sentiment on Opening Bid as well. Price increases could hurt consumer demand. Consumers would pay $13.9 billion to $24 billion more for apparel in the worst-case scenario for tariffs, the National Retail Federation estimated. Read more: How do tariffs work, and who really pays them? ""When we understand truly what's happening, we will have to make some adjustments, and we will adjust accordingly,"" Horowitz said.

But what Trump's second term means for investors is still up for debate. ""We think it’s fair to say that the US equity market is in a discovery process regarding the domestic policy platform of the new administration and that the political backdrop presents tailwinds and potential headwinds for stocks in the year ahead,"" RBC Capital Markets head of US equity strategy Lori Calvasina wrote in a 2025 outlook research note on Monday. Market action since Trump won the election on Nov 6. bears this out. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) soared 2.5% on the day after Trump's victory. Since then, the benchmark index has risen less than 1%. At one point, the S&P 500 had given back all of its post-election bump before rallying higher once more. Small caps, a popular Trump trade, surged after the election, with the Russell 2000 Index (^RUT) rising about 9% in the immediate aftermath. Then the trade reversed, with the index giving back over half its gains. Another swing saw the Russell 2000 hit a record intraday high on Monday. As Calvasina wrote: ""Right now we simply don’t know what the new administration will do in regard to their campaign promises, or the extent to which they will do them, adding to the fog."" Another pillar of the Trump trade saw long-term Treasury yields rise, with investors fearing new tariffs would push inflation higher. News late Friday that the president-elect would nominate Scott Bessent to be the next Treasury secretary calmed some nerves, bringing the 10-year yield roughly back to where it stood on Election Day. In a note to clients on Monday, Capital Economics chief North America economist Paul Ashworth cautioned against reading too much into Trump's Cabinet picks given ""uncertainty surrounding what policies president-elect Donald Trump will enact during his second term."" Ashworth's comments get to the root of the market's issues right now: At the end of the day, campaign promises are just that, promises. During Trump's first term in office, nearly half of the 15 people he initially appointed to lead the executive departments were gone halfway through his presidency. In a note Monday issuing his 2025 year-end S&P 500 forecast of 6,600, Barclays head of US equity strategy Venu Krishna opted not to include any impacts on how US policy shifts could impact earnings or valuations due to the ""fluidity of the Trump 2.0 policy outlook.""

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-aims-for-obama-like-federal-deficits-143248046.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 6:32 AM","Donald Trump wants to reprise the past, making America great again. When it was last great is an open question. Trump’s pick for the next Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, seems to have a date in mind with regard to the federal deficit. He plans to slash deficits to the levels of 2015, when Barack Obama was president. Bessent, a hedge-fund manager, espouses a “three arrows” approach toward overseeing the US economy: reducing federal deficits to 3% of GDP, boosting annual growth to 3%, and producing an additional 3 million barrels of oil domestically each year. Each goal is challenging, perhaps quixotic. Deficit reduction may be the toughest of the three. The federal deficit hit $1.8 trillion in fiscal year 2024, which ended Sept. 30. That was 6.4% of GDP. The last time the deficit came in under 3% of GDP was in 2015, Obama’s seventh year in office. During Donald Trump’s first three years in office, the deficit averaged 4% of GDP. Including 2020, when Trump signed massive amounts of debt-financed COVID relief into law, the Trump deficits were 6.6% of GDP. Under Biden, deficits have averaged 7.6% of GDP, including large amounts of COVID relief Biden signed into law in 2021. On the whole, deficits have grown increasingly larger under every president of the last 23 years, with big jumps when Congress passed large stimulus programs during the financial panic of 2008 and 2009 and during COVID in 2020 and 2021. Bessent has criticized Biden for running large deficits and financing them inefficiently, but he’ll soon discover there’s no easy way to do it better. Deficits aren’t rising inexorably because one president or another pads the budget with extravagant goodies. They’re rising because of spending growth in federal programs that are on autopilot and distribute money to everybody with a legitimate claim. This mandatory spending includes Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, interest on the debt, antipoverty programs such as food aid, and a variety of lesser programs. These are sometimes called “entitlement programs” because the beneficiaries are entitled to the benefits by law. Mandatory spending accounted for 34% of all federal spending in 1965. It has more than doubled to 73% of all federal spending today, according to budget expert Brian Riedl of the Manhattan Institute. The growth in Social Security, Medicare, and interest spending, in particular, will be the main things pushing future deficits even higher. Bessent says he’ll target cutbacks in “discretionary spending,” not including the defense budget, to help lower the deficit while rescinding some of the green energy tax breaks Biden signed into law. Congress would have to enact those changes through new legislation. If it happens, it will scarcely dent the annual deficit. Discretionary spending, which includes stuff like veterans’ benefits, education assistance, highway funding, and medical research, only accounts for 14% of federal outlays. A 10% cut in all that spending — which would be draconian by congressional standards — would only lower the deficit from 6.4% of GDP to 6.1%. Cutting all of it would bring the deficit all the way down to around 3.2% of GDP but also grind transit to a halt, tank the economy, and enrage legions of Americans. Drop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter. Congress is also unlikely to cut defense spending, which is relatively low on a historical basis, and might need to go higher given the warlike aims of Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. The point of this tedious budget math is that nobody is going to make a meaningful dent in deficits and the debt unless they tackle runaway growth in Social Security and Medicare spending, which is known as the ""third rail of politics"" for a reason. These are cherished programs that benefit the most highly engaged group of voters. Messing with them is political suicide, which is why Trump, like most other politicians, promises not to touch them. Trump and his team have the added problem of vowing to extend tax cuts expiring at the end of next year while cutting other taxes such as the ones on tips and Social Security income. Trump could make up a bit of the lost revenue with new tariffs on imports, and Congress could cancel Biden’s tax credits for people who buy electric vehicles. On the whole, however, Trump is set to add trillions of dollars to future deficits. The odds are high Trump will leave office with deficits at a higher portion of GDP than they are under Biden, not a lower level. Bessent might argue that boosting economic growth to the 3% range would bring in more tax revenue to help lower deficits. Yet we’re almost there. Real GDP growth during the last two years has averaged 2.7%, and deficits have risen anyway. Biden critics argue that growth has only been strong during his presidency because of lingering COVID stimulus. Yet the debt-financed tax cuts Trump is proposing, again, are just a different form of stimulus. Nor is it clear Bessent will get his extra 3 million barrels of oil. Fossil fuel firms certainly like Trump’s deregulatory agenda, but they also like the profits that come with moderately high oil prices, and they’re not likely to boost supply if it dents profits. The economy can still prosper under Trump, even if Bessent’s 3-3-3 plan turns out to be more like 6-2-1. But oh, the irony. Back in 2015, when the annual deficit was 2.9% of GDP, Obama’s Republican critics blasted him as the most fiscally irresponsible president in US history. Now the aim is to match Obama’s fiscal performance, and that is probably wishful thinking. Rick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance. Follow him on Twitter at @rickjnewman.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-issues-its-most-bullish-sp-outlook-yet-for-2025-214715852.html,"Mon, Nov 25, 2024, 1:47 PM","Wall Street's high-water mark for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) projects a nearly 17% increase from current levels at the end of 2025. On Monday, Deutsche Bank chief global strategist Binky Chadha issued a year-end target of 7,000 for the S&P 500, matching Yardeni Research's call as the most bullish among strategists tracked by Yahoo Finance. In explaining his thinking, Chadha highlighted the current strong macroeconomic backdrop in which unemployment has remained low while economic growth has proved resilient. ""For equities, strong equity inflows are partly driven by strong cyclical growth as it impacts views on prospective corporate earnings and equity returns,"" Chadha wrote. ""Inflows have also been driven by rising risk appetite which is currently very elevated. It certainly bears watching but risk appetite in our view should be high with the unemployment rate near 4% and GDP growth at 3%, a rare strong combination that has occurred just 6% of the time historically."" Chadha added that prior periods with similar economic backdrops include the 1960s and the back half of the 1990s, which both saw ""strong equity performance."" From a sector perspective, Chadha, like others on Wall Street issuing 2025 outlooks, is skeptical that the next leg higher in markets is led by megacap tech amid slowing earnings growth. Instead, he expects growth to ""continue rotating slowly in 2025"" and is leaning into areas he believes could benefit from continuing economic expansion. ""At the sector level, we maintain a cyclical tilt, remaining overweight the Financials where a multitude of tailwinds are converging, Consumer Cyclicals and Materials,"" Chadha wrote. While much of the focus in 2024 was on signs of slowing in the economy, Chadha's team sees a cycle where various aspects of expansion, like capital expenditure spending outside of tech, corporate confidence increases, and a pickup in mergers and acquisitions (M&A), are ""still to come."" ""US capital markets and M&A activity has been running at low levels on persistent uncertainties around the business cycle, inflation, domestic politics and geopolitics,"" Chadha wrote. ""An unfavourable regulatory regime has also clearly been a drag. A combination of greater corporate confidence and an easier regulatory regime could spark a rebound in M&A and capital markets activity."" Yardeni Research president Ed Yardeni, who also sees the S&P 500 hitting 7,000 by the end of the year, told Yahoo Finance recently that part of that will be driven by a more pro-business Trump administration and the return of ""animal spirits."" ""We're just seeing a more pro-business administration coming in that undoubtedly will cut taxes,"" Yardeni told Yahoo Finance. ""And not only for corporations but also for individuals.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-bullish-charts-showing-how-block-is-breaking-out-post-election-120051884.html,"Wed, Nov 27, 2024, 4:00 AM","Listen and subscribe to Stocks in Translation on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts. Stocks roared last week, with small caps resuming and leading the post-election rally. The poster child of the Trump trade, Tesla (TSLA), is up a cool 35% since Election Day, having broken out to a two-year high. But it's not just the charts; it's the psychology of the patterns the charts form. Breakouts thrive on emotion — fear and greed — and the unrelenting momentum that fuels both bull and bear markets. Technical patterns don't only measure prices, they measure belief. Julius de Kempenaer, creator of Relative Rotation Graphs (RRG), recently joined Yahoo Finance's Stocks in Translation podcast and broke down the ways to play some of these chart patterns. “You want to jump on something that’s [moving] in the right direction,"" de Kempenaer said. ""So, it has established that strength already, and you want to piggyback on that move."" Here's a look at two bullish charts from one stock currently seeing a breakout. Block (SQ) — formerly Square — is a prime example of a pandemic-era darling whose stock price got crushed in the wake of an aggressive Federal Reserve interest rate-hiking cycle. Its 800% rally over a year and a half was followed by an 80% plummet going into 2022. While the ""Magnificent Seven"" megacap tech stocks and the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) soared in 2023 and 2024, Block chopped around in a frustrating consolidation. Recently, however, Block has surged back to life, breaking out of a long-term inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. The ""inverse"" refers to the fact that the pattern (shown above) is the mirror image of a bearish head-and-shoulders top, a pattern consisting of three peaks in which the outer two ""shoulders"" reach similar levels and the middle peak, or ""head,"" rises to a higher level. While no pattern is picture-perfect, most technical analysis practitioners would view the left (upside-down) shoulder — the first of three ""V"" formations — as forming over the first three quarters of 2023. The second dip, the upside-down head, dropped lower than the first, shaking out another wave of investors. The rightmost shoulder got underway in the second quarter of this year, with the price approximately matching the left shoulder. Critically, over this entire two-year period, Square never closed over the $90 baseline — until last week. Block's breakout is now triggering a wave of buying, which de Kempenaer explained using market psychology: ""The people who sold short are the best drivers of the bull market because when you sold short at that previous high, you are now at a loss. So you need to cover your position."" He added that many professional investors will also buy again to initiate a long position. ""There's a double buy,"" he said. Zoom in, and you can see another Block chart pattern forming on a shorter, nine-month time frame. The so-called cup-and-handle pattern is visually simpler than the head-and-shoulders, taking on the form of a gently rounded base that looks like a smile. At the rightmost side, the handle is formed by a pause and consolidation before breaking out. In the case of Block, this relatively small handle only took about four days to complete. Where do prices go from here? Many practitioners of the technical analysis dark arts look for the price ranges of stocks to repeat. Block chopped around for two years in a $50 price range as it was establishing its inverse head-and-shoulder pattern. This points to an upside target of roughly $140 from the $90 breakout level, which would take it to the March 2022 interim high. This represents a 55% gain for someone playing the breakout. However, given the length of the consolidation, many traders will be holding out for higher levels.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/live/stock-market-today-sp-500-dow-notch-fresh-records-as-wall-street-shrugs-off-trumps-tariff-threat-190707130.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 2:43 PM","US stocks on Tuesday shrugged off President-elect Donald Trump's threat to impose new tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico, with two major indexes securing fresh records. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose nearly 0.6% to nab a record close, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also jumped about 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) reversed earlier losses to finish the day up around 0.3% as it reclaimed another back-to-back record. The index had been under pressure for most of the day after drugmaker Amgen (AMGN) tumbled as much as 12% on weight-loss data that failed to impress Wall Street. Shares pared losses by the end of the trading session, closing down around 5%. Markets were initially caught off guard by Trump's pledge late Monday to slap big tariffs on the US's biggest trading partners on his first day in office. His comments fired up trade war fears and dented Wall Street's hopes that Treasury Secretary nominee Scott Bessent would rein in any extreme moves by the new administration. Carmaker stocks, both domestic and abroad, fell on the heels of Trump's ""America First"" push. Nissan (7201.T) and Honda Motor (HMC), which have auto plants in Mexico, came under pressure, along with Ford (F), General Motors (GM), and Stellantis (STLA). Outside of possible tariffs, investors also digested the release of the minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee meeting ended Nov. 7, which showed officials prefer a gradual pace of interest rate cuts if the economy remains on solid footing. ""Participants anticipated that if the data came in about as expected, with inflation continuing to move down sustainably to 2% and the economy remaining near maximum employment, it would likely be appropriate to move gradually toward a more neutral stance of policy over time,"" the minutes read. Some officials noted that a resurgence of inflation, which has remained sticky, along with a downturn in the labor market, could force the central bank to pause its easing cycle. The release sets the stage for the October reading of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, on Wednesday. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy It was another record-setting day on Wall Street as investors shrugged off President-elect Donald Trump's threat to impose new tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico. Both the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) secured record closing highs, with all three major indexes finishing the session in the green. The benchmark S&P 500 rose nearly 0.6%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also jumped about 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) reversed earlier losses to finish the day up around 0.3%. After several months of downbeat data to end the summer left workers feeling sour about the prospect of finding a new job, consumers' feelings about the labor market may be rounding a corner. On Tuesday, fresh data from the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence survey for the month showed the difference between respondents who believe jobs are ""plentiful"" and those saying jobs are ""hard to get"" rose for the second straight month. The metric, known as the labor market differential, ticked up to a reading of 18.2% in November, an increase from the cycle low of 12.7% seen in September. ""This slightly improved read on the jobs market is certainly boosting confidence and if it weren't an election year, it would be the sole focus of consumers,"" Wells Fargo senior economist Tim Quinlan wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. Overall, the upbeat labor market outlook helped propel consumer confidence to a reading of 111.7 in November, above the 109.6 seen in October and the highest level in more than a year. “November’s increase was mainly driven by more positive consumer assessments of the present situation, particularly regarding the labor market,"" said Dana Peterson, chief economist at The Conference Board. ""Compared to October, consumers were also substantially more optimistic about future job availability, which reached its highest level in almost three years."" Minutes from the Federal Reserve's November meeting released on Tuesday showed officials prefer a ""gradual"" interest rate-cutting cycle if the economy continues on its current trajectory. ""Participants anticipated that if the data came in about as expected, with inflation continuing to move down sustainably to 2 percent and the economy remaining near maximum employment, it would likely be appropriate to move gradually toward a more neutral stance of policy over time,"" the minutes read. But recent sticky inflation prints have caught officials' attention. In a recent speech, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman highlighted that the Fed's progress toward its 2% goal has ""stalled"" in the past few months as measures of inflation, excluding gas and autos, have largely moved sideways. Should that trend continue, the central bank may opt to pause interest rate cuts. ""Some participants noted that the Committee could pause its easing of the policy rate and hold it at a restrictive level if inflation remained elevated, and some remarked that policy easing could be accelerated if the labor market turned down or economic activity faltered,"" the minutes read. Rivian stock (RIVN) jumped over 4% in afternoon trade. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports: Late Monday, Rivian said it won a “conditional commitment” from the Department of Energy (DOE) for a $6.6 billion loan, highlighting the company's improving capital condition. The loan, part of the DOE’s Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) program, would support the construction of Rivian’s upcoming assembly plant located outside of Atlanta. Rivian paused development of the site back in March due to concerns about its capital position. At the time, Rivian said building its upcoming R2 vehicles at its existing Normal, Ill., plant instead would save the company over $2 billion in costs. If finalized, the new DOE loan would restart Rivan’s plans to develop the Georgia assembly plant. ""This loan would enable Rivian to more aggressively scale our US manufacturing footprint for our competitively priced R2 and R3 vehicles that emphasize both capability and affordability,” CEO RJ Scaringe said in a statement. “A robust ecosystem of US companies developing and manufacturing EVs is critical for the US to maintain its long-term leadership in transportation.""

The largest digital currency, which posted its longest losing streak since Trump's election win, traded just around $92,500 per token in early afternoon trade. Trump's win pushed bitcoin prices to all-time highs in the immediate aftermath of the election, with the administration viewed as generally more friendly to the alternative asset class. In July, Trump attended a bitcoin conference in Nashville and has since pledged to usher in more supportive regulation. His promises also included appointing a crypto Presidential Advisory Council and firing current SEC Chair Gary Gensler, who announced he would step down on Jan. 20. But markets are now weighing new promises from the president-elect, which include possible tariffs on all Mexican and Canadian imports. That could lead to more risk-aversion sentiment on Wall Street. Other crypto-adjacent names mimicked bitcoin's moves to the downside. Shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR), which owns nearly 280,000 bitcoins, dropped around 3%. Last week, the company announced the purchase of an additional 51,780 bitcoins for $4.6 billion. The company now holds $16.5 billion worth of bitcoin. Coinbase (COIN), which allows crypto trading on its platform, saw shares fall roughly 2%. Amgen (AMGN) was the biggest laggard in the Dow on Tuesday, falling as much as 12% after its weight-loss drug met Wall Street expectations but was only on par with competitors like Eli Lilly (LLY). Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani reports: The company reported 20% weight loss from the drug MariTide in patients after 52 weeks in a phase II study. By comparison, current market leaders Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO) have products that provide weight loss between 14% and 24%. Analysts on an investor call with Amgen Tuesday morning characterized the data as ""in line"" with the currently available products. Mizuho's healthcare sector expert Jared Holz said, on the surface, the data would draw more interest, but because Amgen is late to the weight-loss market — with a phase III trial still needed — it is at a disadvantage. In addition, ""AMGN did not disclose which dose it plans to move forward, but would guess that the higher doses are driving better weight loss so need to consider how the side effect profile looks in these specific formulations,"" Holz wrote in a note to clients.

Late on Monday, Trump said in a post to his Truth Social account that he plans to enact a 25% tariff on all Mexican and Canadian imports. He said the levies would remain in effect until those countries address illegal immigration to the US and drug trafficking. Sheinbaum said on Tuesday that tariffs would lead to increased job losses and inflation. ""To one tariff will come another and so on, until we put our common businesses at risk,"" she told reporters in a briefing. The companies most exposed to the tariffs include automakers with plants in Mexico, such as Nissan, Honda Motor (HMC), Ford (FORD), Stellantis (STLA), and General Motors (GM), among others. “Why impose a tax that puts them at risk?"" Sheinbaum asked. ""It's not acceptable."" The Mexican leader said she plans to send a letter to Trump, urging for more dialogue and collaboration between the two countries. Meanwhile, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday morning that he's agreed to meet with his provincial and territorial counterparts this week to discuss US-Canada relations. ""This is a relationship that we know takes a certain amount of working on,"" Trudeau said. ""And that's what we'll do."" Sales of new single-family homes plummeted in October to the lowest level in about two years as mortgage rates remained elevated during the month. New home sales dropped 17.3% in October to a seasonally adjusted rate of 610,000 units, down from September’s revised rate of 738,000, according to Census Bureau data released on Tuesday. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected a pace of 725,000. The median sales price of new houses sold was $437,300, up from $426,300 the previous month. Mortgage rates marched higher during the month of October, discouraging buyers from purchasing a new home. Builders have adapted accordingly. DR Horton (DHI) CEO Paul Romanowski told investors and analysts on the homebuilder's fourth quarter earnings call in late October that the company's executives “expect incentives will have to remain elevated in order to maintain affordability and monthly payments that our buyers are looking for.” American consumers continue to feel more upbeat about the outlook for the US economy. The latest US consumer confidence index reading from the Conference Board was 111.7, above the 109.6 seen in October and the highest level in more than a year. The expectations index, which is based on consumers' short-term outlook for income, business, and labor market conditions, ticked up 0.4 points to 92.3, significantly above the threshold of 80 that typically signals recession ahead. Less than 64% of respondents said they believe a US recession is ""somewhat"" or ""very likely"" in the next 12 months, marking the lowest number of consumers fearing an incoming recession since the Conference Board began asking the question in July 2022. “November’s increase was mainly driven by more positive consumer assessments of the present situation, particularly regarding the labor market,"" said Dana Peterson, chief economist at The Conference Board. ""Compared to October, consumers were also substantially more optimistic about future job availability, which reached its highest level in almost three years."" In November, 33.4% of consumers said jobs were ""plentiful,"" down from the 34.1% seen in October. But the number of respondents saying jobs were ""hard to get"" also fell to 15.2% from 17.6% seen the month prior. US stocks opened mixed to kick off Tuesday's trading session, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dropping 0.3% after the index notched its latest record. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) inched up roughly 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) jumped about 0.4% as investors weighed the latest tariff threat from President-elect Donald Trump. US home prices rose in September, but the pace of price increases moderated on an annual basis. The S&P Case-Shiller National Home Price Index increased 3.9% from a year ago, a smaller increase from the 4.2% annual gain seen in August. Prices rose 0.3% over the prior month in September on a seasonally adjusted basis, unchanged from August’s monthly increase. The index tracking home prices in the 20 largest metropolitan areas gained 0.2% in September from August, lower than a Bloomberg consensus estimate of 0.3% and August’'s 0.4%. The 20-city index jumped 4.6% compared to last September. August's annual gain was 5.2%. “Home price growth stalled in the third quarter, after a steady start to 2024,” Brian Luke, head of commodities, real & digital assets at S&P Dow Jones Indices, wrote in a press release. “The slight downtick could be attributed to technical factors as the seasonally adjusted figures boasted a 16th consecutive all-time high.""

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-ways-scott-bessents-honeymoon-as-trumps-treasury-secretary-could-end-090041104.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 1:00 AM","The early reviews for Treasury Secretary nominee Scott Bessent from Wall Street are in — and they're positive. But now the hard part begins. Bessent now faces significant trip wires in the months ahead due to his challenging job to both calm markets while also selling Trump's unorthodox plans. The president-elect highlighted the tricky task on Monday evening when he abruptly announced a 25% tariff ""on ALL products"" coming from Mexico and Canada as well as new 10% duties on China on his first day in office because of drugs and illegal immigration. The dual moves, if he follows through once in office, could destabilize importers hoping for a more gradual tariff rollout, and Bessent's task could be heightened by his own recent commentary on tariffs as well as the Federal Reserve. But for now, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose more than 400 points Monday amid optimism for the ""investor favorite"" pick. The ebullience was in part because Trump, after flirting with more out-of-the-box choices like Howard Lutnick, ended up settling on a known quantity with a long investing track record in a macroeconomic context as his top economic official. ""Trump's economic team is more pragmatic,"" Eurasia Group president Ian Bremmer wrote in a note Monday morning. ""That's particularly true with Scott Bessent."" Here are some of the ways his honeymoon could end up tapering off or be short-lived. One tricky topic will be tariffs. Bessent made a keen public show, notably via a FoxNews.com op-ed earlier this month, of expressing his fondness for Trump's tariff plans as he campaigned for the job. But he also offered some careful caveats to calm wary businesses, which offered a level of contrast to Trump's often-expressed desire for across-the-board duties. ""Used strategically, tariffs can increase revenue to the Treasury, encourage businesses to restore production and reduce our reliance on industrial production from strategic rivals,"" he wrote, repeatedly underlining a focus on ""strategically important industries."" Read more: How do tariffs work, and who really pays them? In a Yahoo Finance interview earlier this year, Bessent even described Trump's plans for 60% tariffs on China as a negotiating position, adding, ""I would be surprised if we ever hit that."" Another comment, which Bessent's critics have circulated in recent days, showed him saying, ""Donald Trump really is a free-trader"" and that his goal is for Trump to ""save international trade, not [a return to] turn-of-the-century tariffs."" That will clearly, to put it mildly, be a debate within the administration. Trump often talked during the campaign about how tariffs can be good by themselves to raise revenue and also often pined for 1900-era tariffs imposed during the time of then-President William McKinley. Bessent may find himself in a debate with Lutnick, whom Trump picked to ""lead our Tariff and Trade agenda"" as a Commerce secretary nominee. Lutnick was Bessent's former rival for the Treasury job and has also touted those historic tariffs. ""When was America great?"" Lutnick asked the crowd at Madison Square Garden before the election and before discussing the 1890s as an era where ""all we had was tariffs"" and the economy was ""rocking."" The final call will, of course, belong to Trump. ""The bigger issue is that the main calls on the economy are going to be President Trump's,"" said Jason Furman, a Harvard professor and former chair of Barack Obama's Council of Economic Adviser, in a Yahoo Finance interview on Monday. Trump ""hasn't given us any signals that he's given up on large, across-the-board tariffs, and until I hear that I'm going to be nervous."" Another past Bessent comment could also be in focus: his idea during the campaign for a ""shadow"" Fed chair. He floated the notion in an October Barron's interview that Trump could essentially make current Fed Chair Jerome Powell a lame duck long before his term ends. Powell's full term as a member of the Fed's board of governors doesn't end until 2028, but his time atop the Federal Reserve as chair ends sooner, in 2026. If Trump acted to name a successor early, Bessent argued at the time, ""based on the concept of forward guidance, no one is really going to care what Jerome Powell has to say anymore."" Bessent has reportedly backed away from the idea in private, but on Monday morning, Sen. Elizabeth Warren offered that the central bank could be a key element of potential progressive opposition to Trump's choice. ""It would be a serious error for the Trump administration to interfere with the Fed's independence, as Mr. Bessent has suggested,"" she wrote in a statement. Warren could be sitting across from Bessent multiple times in the coming years as a current member of the Senate Finance Committee, where his confirmation hearing has traditionally taken place, in her likely new perch atop the Senate's banking committee in 2025. It's also an issue that clearly will be closely watched by markets. ""Any action challenging the independence of the Fed [is] a consistent concern raised in client conversations,"" Raymond James Washington policy analyst Ed Mills wrote in his own Monday note. Bessent could also face some unrest from the right. He emerged as Trump's choice after a bruising selection process that saw some of Trump's closest allies openly advocate against him. Elon Musk notably called Bessent ""a business-as-usual choice."" He didn't mean it as a compliment. Bessent would be part of ""the moderate wing of the Cabinet, with support in both parties,"" AGF Investments chief US policy strategist Greg Valliere wrote in a note on Monday. Indeed, questions about Bessent have burbled on the right ever since he emerged as a frontrunner for the post weeks ago. Much of the MAGA-world concern comes from his previous job as an investing chief for George Soros, a top villain in right-wing circles. Bessent left Soros Fund Management in 2015 and co-founded his own investment firm, Key Square Group. And Bessent has been a generous GOP donor in recent years, giving more than $3.1 million to Trump and other Republicans during the recent election season, according to government records. But before that, he was a giver to both Democrats and Republicans, including to figures like Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, and others. Another pressure point for Bessent will be fulfilling Trump's campaign promise of a complete extension of his 2017 tax cuts as well as a dizzying array of additional tax cut promises. Bessent will likely be tasked with making sure those tax cuts happen. He called them a top priority in an interview over the weekend with the Wall Street Journal. But the path ahead there is far from certain. The federal corporate tax rate could be closely watched by markets and particularly contentious politically. Trump has promised that the current 21% rate will drop to 15%. But others in his own party have signaled the rate might be fine where it is — or even that they would accept an increase up to 25% if they can pay for other priorities. The larger issue for Trump and Bessent of getting those tax cuts into law could be the $36 trillion national debt and questions about whether any new expensive cuts are even possible. In a recent episode of Yahoo Finance's Capitol Gains podcast, Whalen Global Advisors chairman Chris Whalen was unsparing about the fiscal challenge ahead. ""Trump may not get a chance to do what he wants to do,"" he said. ""When the numbers get this big, your choices start to get fewer and fewer.""

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-debuts-ai-model-that-can-create-music-mimic-speech-215445821.html,"Mon, Nov 25, 2024, 1:54 PM","Nvidia (NVDA) has developed a new kind of artificial intelligence model that can create sound effects, change the way a person sounds, and generate music using natural language prompts. Called Fugatto, or Foundational Generative Audio Transformer Opus 1, the model is a research project. Nvidia says it’s not announcing any plans to release the technology, but it could have broad implications for industries ranging from music and entertainment to translation services. “The thing that's so exciting about [Fugatto] is that having a model that you can prompt to ask it to make sounds in certain ways really opens up the landscape of things that you can imagine doing with it,” Bryan Catanzaro, vice president of applied deep learning research at Nvidia, told Yahoo Finance. Shares of Nvidia fell 4% on the day. What sets Fugatto apart from other models, Catanzaro explained, is that it can perform the tasks of several other models. For instance, there are models that can synthesize speech and others that can add sound effects to music; Fugatto, however, does it all. Think of it as a kind of complement to video- and image-generating models like Stability AI’s Stable Video Diffusion or OpenAI’s Sora. “The foundational improvement here is that … we're able to synthesize audio using language, and that, I think, opens up new prospects for tools that people can use to create amazing audio,” Catanzaro added. According to Nvidia, Fugatto is the first foundational model with emergent properties, which means it’s able to mix the elements it’s been trained on and follow “free-form instructions.” The model can generate audio via standard word prompts as well as manipulate audio files that you upload. So if you have a file of a person speaking, you could translate that person’s words to another language while still making it sound like their voice. You could also take a simple tune and make it sound like an orchestral performance or add different beats to music. You can also upload a document and have the model read it in any voice you’d like. What’s more, you can tell the model to produce voices that carry emotional weight. Want audio of a dejected English teacher reading Edgar Allen Poe? Fugatto should be able to do it. Catanzaro, however, warns that the model isn’t always perfect. And some results are better than others. Like generative image and video models, Fugatto raises questions about the potential impact on artists, sound engineers, and people in related fields. Catanzaro, though, says he hopes the technology helps musicians. ""I hope what it means is new tools for artists to explore,” he explained. “I think audio has always been a fruitful place for exploration. You know, when we get new tools for audio, sometimes we get new forms of music.” Read more: Nvidia's market value is up 195% over 11 months. Is it still a good time to invest? That’s certainly true. The guitar gave rise to blues and rock, while turntables helped birth hip-hop as we know it today. The entertainment industry, however, has a rocky relationship with AI. The Writers Guild of America and SAG-AFTRA fought Hollywood studios over fears that the studios would use AI to cut writing jobs or replicate actors’ and actresses’ likenesses.

New home sales dropped 17.3% in October from the previous month to a seasonally adjusted rate of 610,000 units, according to Census Bureau data released on Tuesday. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected a pace of 725,000. ""New home sales were much weaker than expected in October, with Hurricanes Helene and Milton taking a much larger toll than anticipated on sales in the South,"" Nancy Vanden Houten, lead US economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note after the data's release. ""We expect sales to rebound from their October pace in the months ahead as rebuilding in the South gets underway."" Sales in the South fell 28% to 339,000 in October, marking the slowest rate of increase since April 2020. In addition to the hurricanes, buyers dealt with expensive borrowing costs as well as rising home prices. The median sales price of new houses sold was $437,300 in October, up from $426,300 the previous month. ""October's weak sales came alongside increases in mortgage rates throughout the month,"" Colin Johanson, US macroeconomic research analyst at Barclays, wrote in a note after the release. ""New home sales are measured at the time of contract signing, so reflect a more current picture of mortgage rates than existing home sales, which are measured at the time of closing.""

The Pending Home Sales index, which measures signed real estate contracts for existing single-family homes, condos, and co-ops, rose 2% to 77.4 from a month earlier. An index of 100 is equal to the level of contract activity in 2001. Activity rose in all parts of the country, led by the Northeast, which saw a 4.7% month-over-month gain. Contract signings in the Midwest rose 4%, while gains in the South and West were smaller. “Homebuying momentum is building after nearly two years of suppressed home sales,” Lawrence Yun, chief economist for the National Association of Realtors, said in a statement. “Even with mortgage rates modestly rising … continuous job additions and more housing inventory are bringing more consumers to the market.” Compared to a year earlier, contract activity rose 5.4% nationwide.

President-elect Donald Trump's win has kicked off a new era of crypto enthusiasm, as he has pledged to ""ensure that the United States will be the crypto capital of the planet."" To the delight of crypto execs and investors, the next president has also promised to create a national bitcoin reserve. Last week, bitcoin touched a record high just shy of the once-mythical $100,000 mark. SEC Chair Gary Gensler, a villain to the crypto faithful for his industry crackdown, is on his way out.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-elon-musk-thinks-impoundment-could-be-the-key-to-making-his-doge-ideas-a-reality-140104360.html,"Mon, Nov 25, 2024, 1:19 AM","Donald Trump and ""first buddy"" Elon Musk aren't even formally in power yet, but they already appear to be chafing at the spending constraints Congress could place on them. So political and economic observers might be wise to familiarize themselves with the wonky concept of ""impoundment,"" which concerns what happens when Congressionally appropriated money simply isn't spent by the president's executive branch. This bit of Washington-ese is important, as it could be determinative about whether Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy and their new extra-governmental ""Department of Government Efficiency"" can follow through on some of their bigger ideas, such as cutting the annual federal budget by at least $2 trillion. Musk and Ramaswamy are looking to cut a lot but lack any formal authority to do so; it's Congress that has the ""power of the purse"" to decide how governmental money is used. But the incoming Trump team may aim to at least tweak that. Just this week, in a Wall Street Journal op-ed focused on a range of strategies the two men are looking to employ, Musk and Ramaswamy noted the importance of impoundment to their plans and said the question may end up before the Supreme Court. They argued that the current presidential limits are unconstitutional, saying Trump will challenge them ""and we believe the current Supreme Court would likely side with him on this question."" Trump has also weighed in on the issue in a campaign video in the summer of 2023, when he said that the law ""wrongfully curtailed"" the president's powers in this area and called it ""a blatant violation of the separation of powers."" Whether justices indeed agree with Trump and Musk remains to be seen. But what will be at issue if a case reaches their docket is a Watergate-era reform called the Impoundment Control Act of 1974. The law laid out a process that the president must follow if he or she wishes to diverge from congressionally mandated funding for any program. In short: The White House needs to go back to Congress to ask permission. Impoundment was indeed a power that presidents enjoyed for most of US history, but it was traditionally used only to send back excess funds if Congress put aside too much. That changed when then-President Richard Nixon attempted to stymie an environmental project using the impoundment process after Congress overrode his veto and allocated the money against his wishes. That action led to the 1974 law (part of a wave of post-Watergate reforms) and was further solidified by a Supreme Court ruling in 1975 that has been interpreted as saying the president can't use impoundment to frustrate the will of Congress. Trump has also toyed with impoundment authority before, most notably when he slow-walked funds to Ukraine as he pressured that country's president, Volodymyr Zelensky, to help him politically by pushing for an investigation into Joe Biden. The move helped lead to Trump's first impeachment, with the temporary withholding of those funds deemed illegal at the time by a government watchdog. Congressional Democrats responded then with a pledge to push back, vowing ""Congress will not bend to executive overreach."" This time around, Trump, Musk, and Ramaswamy appear very much interested in going even further. ""With impoundment, we can simply choke off the money,"" Trump offered in his 2023 video. Musk and Ramaswamy have added that they want to eliminate entire departments (""delete as many as possible,"" Musk recently posted) which could run into deep resistance in Congress. In their recent communications, Musk and Ramaswamy have also laid out an array of alternate strategies to accomplish their goal in unorthodox ways. Their ideas range from overriding civil services protections to cut agencies to the ""minimum number of employees required"" to using a recent Supreme Court decision around federal regulations as a battering ram to more deeply cut red tape. Musk and Ramaswamy have also floated cuts to annual federal expenditures where funding has technically lapsed, though experts have noted that the biggest-ticket item there is a politically popular one that provides veterans with healthcare.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/experts-how-trumps-healthcare-picks-could-impact-global-health-202357177.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 12:23 PM","President-elect Donald Trump's nominees for the country's top health agencies and his previous track record in office have sparked concerns globally about a potential rise in ""anti-science"" views and the defunding of global public health efforts. For example, during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Trump administration severed US ties with the World Health Organization (WHO). Even though President Joe Biden restored the relationship, the subsequent struggle to get US-made vaccines in lower-income countries allowed countries like Russia and China to play greater-than-expected roles in the global pandemic response. Trump also previously defunded or threatened to defund programs that didn't align with his agenda on reproductive rights, known as the global gag rule. This is why Trump's new round of nominees and their potential global reach is concerning global public health experts. US health agencies, along with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), are still the gold standard for drug approval and disease-fighting strategies. However, that could diminish, several experts told Yahoo Finance. ""It already happens that the FDA [Food and Drug Administration], EMA, and MHRA make a few different decisions,"" said Martin McKee, a professor of European public health at London's School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. ""However, the FDA decisions are adopted by many countries without their own regulatory bodies, so I assume that they will look to EMA instead — but it's all very uncertain."" Trump nominated Marty Makary, a professor at Johns Hopkins University and chief medical officer of telehealth platform Sesame, to lead the FDA. Makary is viewed as a potentially uncontroversial pick by experts, which could help allay concerns. But some experts say the top health agency nominee, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is the greater concern. Angie Rasmussen, a virologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada, said many of Trump's nominees are aligned on some topics and have some level of skepticism toward science. ""It's going to bring down the standing of the US no matter what, to put anti-vaxxers in charge of public health agencies,"" she said. She added, ""The extent of the damage will depend on how effective [the nominees] are at implementing some of their promised changes,"" Rasmussen noted it is hard to predict the time frame of any changes. But some experts suggested that the impact of the president-elect's nominees could be limited. That's because the FDA and CDC have layers of institutional leaders and staff that hold steady during administration changes after every presidential election. But even those jobs could be in jeopardy if Trump's government efficiency efforts, led by Vivek Ramaswamy and Elon Musk, are successful, according to Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. The second key area of impact if all of Trump's healthcare nominees are confirmed is the role of the US in providing aid to fight epidemics and provide support for global public health needs. That includes the GAVI Vaccine Alliance, which helps fund vaccination efforts, and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which has helped set up public health efforts domestically in other countries. Gavin Yamey, a professor of global health and public policy at Duke University, told Yahoo Finance that while it's hard to know how impactful the nominees will be in these efforts, concern is brewing. ""I think there's every reason to be deeply concerned about the future of global health cooperation by the United States in a Trump 2.0,"" he said. ""There's plenty of evidence to show that he really took steps to withdraw from multilateralism. His surrogates like [US Rep.] Marjorie Taylor Greene have said publicly that [they think] he's going to once again withdraw the US from WHO,"" he added. McKee, a past president of the European Public Health Association, told Yahoo Finance that the global public health community is already discussing the implications of Trump's picks. He coauthored an opinion piece in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) last week emphasizing the level of uncertainty. In addition to the WHO, the US could also pull funding from other efforts like global vaccination due to the beliefs of RFK. ""Risks include reduced contributions to international health organizations and pressure to modify intellectual property regimes and trade agreements to support US corporate interests,"" McKee wrote. It's why, if fears become reality, the US could set a bad example for the world, Rasmussen said. ""[Trump] is installing nominees at key agencies who are going to dismantle them,"" Rasmussen said. ""If the FDA is no longer a functional regulatory agency, if the CDC can't investigate disease outbreaks, and if NIH can't carry out or fund research, the US will be a cautionary tale for the world and that is definitively unfavorable."" And a spillover effect is already happening in Canada. Dr. Madhukar Pai, chair of the Department of Global and Public Health at McGill University, said anti-abortion policies ""might expand well beyond the US, and there are already such initial efforts in Canada, which might get fanned [by] the conservatives from our government in the elections next year."" Canada's CBC News also reported last week that a resident, allegedly supported by RFK Jr., successfully petitioned for the removal of fluoride in Montreal. That's why experts are wary of the nominees and their global impact. ""Everything's sort of unknown at this point,"" Hotez said. ""I think we're kind of waiting to see how it all happens.""

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/musk-is-promising-massive-cuts-in-red-tape-but-trumps-agenda-could-add-regulations-elsewhere-180947850.html,"Wed, Nov 27, 2024, 10:09 AM","Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy are promising to go to war with the government red tape they say makes it harder to do business as part of their extra-governmental ""Department of Government Efficiency"" (DOGE). But they will face formidable foes — and perhaps not just from those ""unelected bureaucrats"" they often pillory. In addition to Washington's historic appetite for new rules, the DOGE leaders could also find that Trump's own campaign promises will lead to the sprouting of some new red tape. If you are a business owner looking forward to government regulation reductions in the years ahead, the industry in which you operate could make all the difference. Key deregulatory action is indeed in the offing in places like energy and financial services, said Dan Goldbeck, director of Regulatory Policy at the American Action Forum, a group that tracks regulations closely. Musk on Wednesday suggested on X, his social-media platform, that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau could be abolished altogether. ""Delete CFPB,"" he wrote. ""There are too many duplicative regulatory agencies."" But Trump administration actions to come in areas like immigration and healthcare may end up pushing in the opposite direction, according to Goldbeck. It's ""an interesting mixed bag,"" he added. President Trump in his first term — like Republican presidents before him — made cutting regulations into a key focus and even held photo-ops at the White House to underline his determination before the cameras. But Trump, also like his predecessors, had a more mixed record overall. During Trump's entire first term, according to data from Goldbeck's group, Washington finalized 1,336 regulations across a range of government agencies — with a total cost of $64.7 billion to business and almost 330 million paperwork hours. In fact, Trump actually increased regulations on business in three of the four years he was in office. It was only in 2018 when the cost of regulations saw a decrease. And Trump was still one of the most aggressive cutters in recent memory. The American Action Forum tracked regulations all the way back to 2005 and found that Trump's 2018 cuts marked the only year where the total finalized cost of government red tape came down during that two-decade span. And those costs are way up in the Biden years: calculated to be a whopping $1.8 trillion so far. Trump 1.0 also increased costs in areas like immigration and healthcare — with Goldbeck predicting Trump 2.0 could be similar. He noted, as one example, what could happen if Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is confirmed as secretary of the Health and Human Services Department. If ""they are serious about going after agribusiness interests and pharmaceutical business's interests, there's potential for a fair amount of unexpected regulatory action compared to what maybe most folks expect."" More red tape could also be created if Trump follows through on a pledge to deport undocumented immigrants. ""Implementing such a massive deportation program is going to be in a lot of ways regulatory in nature,"" Goldbeck said. Musk and Ramaswamy could also also face a legal environment that might not be quite as friendly to their cause as they hope. In a recent op-ed, the duo argued that two recent Supreme Court decisions around regulations — West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency and Loper Bright v. Raimondo — would buttress their efforts. But that claim led many legal experts confused. The decisions are indeed likely to increase the power of the judiciary and Congress to strike down regulations, but they offer much less clear implications for executive actions from a president. Goldbeck adds that the slow pace of any regulatory change could also hamstring DOGE's efforts to move quickly and show significant results by the group's planned end date of July 4, 2026. He notes that much of the coming Trump administration's efforts will be focused on rescinding Biden-era rules that will take a complete rule-making process to complete. ""That'll take at least a year or two to really come to fruition."" Ben Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/property-brothers-millions-of-boomers-will-need-to-retrofit-their-homes-160010913.html,"Sun, Nov 24, 2024, 8:00 AM","Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts. Another boomer financial dilemma. With over 4 million baby boomers planning to retire each year, a big question arises about their homes: Should they stay or should they go? An increasing number are deciding to age in place, creating new dynamics to navigate for the US housing market. “There will be more boomers entering the era where they’re going to need to stay in a facility that accommodates seniors,” housing expert Jonathan Scott told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in below). He added that some may opt to move out of the family home, leaving “inventory that comes from that or homes that need to be adapted"" or renovated. For those deciding to stay in place, homes will need to be retrofitted for senior safety purposes — think everything from a rail in the shower to a new security system. Jonathan and his twin brother Drew are the infamous dynamic duo from HGTV’s ""Property Brothers,"" a show where they assist families in finding and renovating homes. The brothers Scott have also branched out with the Healthy Home Innovation Fund, which is about to put money to work in early 2025 in tech companies that innovate in the residential sector. The brothers speak from firsthand experience on home ownership and aging family members. “They’re trying to find a place where they can age in place,” Drew said of their parents. “They want this to be their last home, so [we are] thinking of how we can maximize the space for them to enjoy.” Their parents are not alone. According to a new survey of 1,001 boomers from LeafHome, 55% plan to remain in their home, while 73% reported they had lived in their home for 11 years or more. Over half of the homes were built in 1980 or earlier and many hadn’t been renovated, and 24% of respondents were working on altering their current home to better accommodate their coming and current needs. To keep the aging population safe, the brothers Scott credit new technology. While ramps and altering stairs are common moves, “the technology is so key,” said Drew Scott, citing innovations geared toward safety. “There are ranges or ovens that will shut off automatically.” “It’s those sorts of things that you need because people can get forgetful,” added Jonathan. Other hazards include slip and fall mishaps and vulnerability to disasters. “Water waste reduction is an important thing too,” said Drew. “There are a lot of old homes or condos that have leaks.” Converting to smarter homes is one way to capitalize on technology offerings as well. “There’s so much tech that you can control from your phone that keeps every aspect of your home safe,” said Drew. Renovations won't come cheap for boomers or their children aiming to lend a hand. Near retirement and worrying about your financial future? Check out the Decoding Retirement podcast. Truehold estimates consumers can expect to spend anywhere from $10,000 to $100,000 in age-related alterations. Ultimately, whether they’re choosing to stay put and upgrade the property or move to something more accommodating, the primary goal remains clear for the brothers Scott. “We don’t want [our parents] just to feel like they’re surviving. They need to thrive in that space and to feel that independence in their home,” said Drew.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/after-nvidia-earnings-is-the-ai-trend-still-investors-friend-150035522.html,"Sun, Nov 24, 2024, 7:16 AM","Trends are trends because they come and go, with the world of investing and markets certainly no exception. In 2020, it was work from home. In 2021, it was the Great Reopening. In 2022, it was crypto and digital assets and a bit of ESG. The year 2023 was all about the ""Magnificent Seven."" And this year? Clearly, artificial intelligence, with global leader Nvidia (NVDA) at the top. A quick look at the attention and coverage Nvidia receives in the run-up to its quarterly earnings cinches it as the stock of 2024. It has also quickly catapulted the company into rarified air, where analysts and investors continuously place surreal expectations on how much the company is selling, how much it’s expected to sell, and how much demand there will be for its AI-focused chips. Its most recent earnings report was no exception, with Superbowl-like media coverage leading up to and following the numbers on Wednesday. There’s little question why: Nvidia is clearly the King of AI, with massive, household-name customers like Microsoft (MSFT), Google (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and more scooping up its semiconductors and hardware at a ferocious clip to amp up their AI-driven offerings. But when it comes to investing, it is very much about the potential. Despite Nvidia blowing past expectations for the quarter and issuing better-than-expected guidance, the stock temporarily stumbled. Investors were either taking profits from prior investments in the stock or were soured on the fact that the gains — a 94% increase in sales for the three-month period — weren’t what they used to be. Nvidia previously reported growth of 122% in the second quarter, 262% in the first quarter, and 265% in the fourth quarter of 2023. AI believers argue that the world is only at the beginning of transitioning to the next level of computing, where large language models and algorithms process faster and deeper than ever before. And Nvidia believers argue that Nvidia is leaps and bounds beyond its competition in supplying the needed chips and hardware. “We are in the very, very early stages of a transformational moment in computing,” Creative Strategies director of consumer technology practice Ben Bajarin told Yahoo Finance on Thursday following the earnings report. On the flip side, some analysts are suspicious about whether Nvidia's customers, including Meta (META), Microsoft, and Google, can make back the billions they’re spending on AI hardware. Nvidia’s ability to keep up with demand for its highly sought-after Blackwell chip is also giving some analysts pause, including Emarketer’s Jacob Bourne. “Critical questions around Blackwell’s production ramp and customer concentration remain key concerns,” Bourne said in a note. “There’s little room for execution missteps in 2025.” There is also political uncertainty, given Donald Trump’s threat to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world, including chips and components produced outside of the US, specifically those made in Taiwan. Trump has stated that companies like TSMC that currently produce chips for Nvidia and others in Taiwan would be incentivized to construct chip manufacturing plants, or fabs, in the US to avoid having to pay tariffs. For the most part, investors and analysts seem to be more than prepared to continue betting on Nvidia into 2025. Year to date, the stock is up more than 210%. That said, expectations for the next quarter are already up there: Revenue for the quarter ending in January 2025 is expected to come in at $38 billion, according to the average of 40 analyst estimates tracked by Yahoo Finance, up from $35.1 billion in the most recent quarter. Of course, there is no such thing as insatiable demand, and there will come a time when AI development may overtake AI execution. Even before that point, investors and Wall Street will very likely have already reassessed and adjusted their expectations for future Nvidia sales and earnings.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tker-wall-street-strategists-nailing-one-of-their-more-important-forecasts-for-2024-223310178.html,"Sun, Nov 24, 2024, 2:43 PM","A version of this post first appeared on TKer.co Last week, Wall Street began circulating their outlooks for the stock market in 2025. For many folks, the key takeaway from these reports is the year-end price target. As TKer subscribers know, I’m not crazy about taking these price targets too seriously. Sure, I keep an eye out for these targets (see here, here, and here). But I’m far more interested in the rigorous research behind these predictions. That’s because much of the underlying data and analysis that go into these calls is high quality and very insightful. While it’s been the case their year-end price targets have been way off on the conservative side, strategists have actually nailed one important prediction: 2024 earnings. At the beginning of the year, strategists’ estimates for 2024 S&P 500 earnings per share (EPS) ranged from $225 to $250. According to FactSet, after three quarters worth of reported earnings, 2024 EPS is on track to be $240. That is to say, the consensus midpoint EPS estimate has been off by what amounts to a rounding error. ""Wall Street analysts have been reasonably good at predicting forward year earnings over the last few years,"" wrote Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek Research. How we’re getting these earnings might not be exactly how the strategists may have laid out a year ago. But they were right about major themes driving earnings growth like persistently high profit margins and looser Fed monetary policy. If the earnings have been coming through, then why have strategists been so off with their price targets? As we discussed in the May 24 TKer, assumptions about valuation multiples are where Wall Street’s calculations often go wrong. At the beginning of the year, forward price/earnings (P/E) multiple was 19x. Many strategists believed that was high and there was little room for it to go higher. Some even expected it to come down. Today, the forward P/E is about 22x. At first glance, the difference between 19x and 22x might not seem like much. But when you actually apply it to an EPS estimate, the range of S&P price scenarios can be wide. For example, here’s what the price scenarios look like assuming $275 EPS (which is what the consensus is expecting for 2025): 19x $275 EPS = 5,225 20x $275 EPS = 5,500 21x $275 EPS = 5,775 22x $275 EPS = 6,050 Differing assumptions about valuations are often why price target calculations vary, and inaccurate assumptions about valuations are why those targets almost always go wrong. For long-term investors in the stock market, I don’t think it’s a good use of energy to obsess over exactly where the stock market might be exactly one year from now — especially since no one has figured out how to do that accurately and consistently. It is, however, much more helpful to be aware of the fundamentals driving earnings because earnings are the most important long-term driver of stock prices. If the prospects for earnings growth are attractive, then it’s probably not crazy to think stock prices will head in that direction. Indeed, it’s usually the case that EPS have grown, and it is also the case that the S&P 500 has moved higher. Similarly, strategists’ annual forecasts tend to predict the direction of earnings is up and the direction of prices is also up. Maybe strategists rarely nail their price targets. But directionally, they tend to get things right. Thanksgiving dinner got cheaper. From the American Farm Bureau: ""The American Farm Bureau Federation’s 39th annual Thanksgiving dinner survey provides a snapshot of the average cost of this year’s classic holiday feast for 10, which is $58.08 or about $5.80 per person. This is a 5% decrease from 2023, which was 4.5% lower than 2022. Two years of declines don’t erase dramatic increases that led to a record high cost of $64.06 in 2022. Despite the encouraging momentum, a Thanksgiving meal is still 19% higher than it was in 2019, which highlights the impact inflation has had on food prices – and farmers’ costs – since the pandemic."" Consumer sentiment improves. From the University of Michigan’s November Surveys of Consumers: ""In November, sentiment extended a four-month stretch of consecutive incremental increases. Post-election interviews were 1.3 points below the pre-election reading, moderating the improvement seen earlier in the month. Overall, the stability of national sentiment this month obscures discordant partisan patterns."" The survey emphasized the politics factor: ""In a mirror image of November 2020 (see chart), the expectations index surged for Republicans and fell for Democrats this month, a reflection of the two groups’ incongruous views of how Trump’s policies will influence the economy… Ultimately, substantial uncertainty remains over the future implementation of Trump’s economic agenda, and consumers will continue to re-calibrate their views in the months ahead."" Card spending data is holding up. From JPMorgan: ""As of 12 Nov 2024, our Chase Consumer Card spending data (unadjusted) was 0.9% above the same day last year. Based on the Chase Consumer Card data through 12 Nov 2024, our estimate of the US Census November control measure of retail sales m/m is 0.36%."" From BofA: ""Total card spending per HH was up 0.6% y/y in the week ending Nov 16, according to BAC aggregated credit & debit card data. Within the sectors we report, online electronics, airlines & lodging showed the biggest y/y rise since Nov 3."" Unemployment claims tick lower. Initial claims for unemployment benefits declined to 213,000 during the week ending November 16, down from 219,000 the week prior. This metric continues to be at levels historically associated with economic growth. Gas prices tick lower. From AAA: ""At the pump, the national average for a gallon of gas dropped two cents since last week to $3.06 – matching the January 2024 low. There are now 28 states with averages below $3."" Mortgage rates tick up. According to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage rose to 6.84%, up from 6.78% last week. From Freddie Mac: ""Heading into the holidays, purchase demand remains in the doldrums. While for-sale inventory is increasing modestly, the elevated interest rate environment has caused new construction to soften."" There are 147 million housing units in the U.S., of which 86.6 million are owner-occupied and 34 million of which are mortgage-free. Of those carrying mortgage debt, almost all have fixed-rate mortgages, and most of those mortgages have rates that were locked in before rates surged from 2021 lows. All of this is to say: Most homeowners are not particularly sensitive to movements in home prices or mortgage rates. Home sales rise. Sales of previously owned homes increased by 3.4% in October to an annualized rate of 3.96 million units. From NAR chief economist Lawrence Yun: ""The worst of the downturn in home sales could be over, with increasing inventory leading to more transactions. Additional job gains and continued economic growth appear assured, resulting in growing housing demand. However, for most first-time homebuyers, mortgage financing is critically important. While mortgage rates remain elevated, they are expected to stabilize."" Home prices rise. Prices for previously owned homes rose from last month’s levels. From the NAR: ""The median existing-home price for all housing types in October was $407,200, up 4.0% from one year ago ($391,600). All four U.S. regions registered price increases."" Homebuilder sentiment improves. From the NAHB’s Carl Harris: ""With the elections now in the rearview mirror, builders are expressing increasing confidence that Republicans gaining all the levers of power in Washington will result in significant regulatory relief for the industry that will lead to the construction of more homes and apartments."" New home construction falls. Housing starts declined 3.1% in October to an annualized rate of 1.31 million units, according to the Census Bureau. Building permits fell 0.6% to an annualized rate of 1.42 million units. Offices remain relatively empty. From Kastle Systems: ""The weekly average occupancy increased three points to 52.7%, according to the 10-city Back to Work Barometer, the highest it has been since its post-pandemic record of 53% in late January. Occupancy rose in all 10 tracked cities, with nine cities increasing more than a full point. Chicago and Washington, DC both rose more than five points, to 56.1% and 49.7%, respectively. Houston, Dallas, and New York City all reached record highs, up to 62.8%, 61.4%, and 55%, respectively."" Most U.S. states are still growing. From the Philly Fed’s October State Coincident Indexes report: ""Over the past three months, the indexes increased in 35 states, decreased in nine states, and remained stable in six, for a three-month diffusion index of 52. Additionally, in the past month, the indexes increased in 30 states, decreased in 12 states, and remained stable in eight, for a one-month diffusion index of 36."" Activity survey looks good. From S&P Global’s November U.S. PMI: ""The prospect of lower interest rates and a more probusiness approach from the incoming administration has fueled greater optimism, in turn helping drive output and order book inflows higher in November. The rise in the headline flash PMI indicates that economic growth is accelerating in the fourth quarter, while at the same time inflationary pressures are cooling. The survey's price gauge covering goods and services signaled only a marginal increase in prices in November, pointing to consumer inflation running well below the Fed's 2% target."" Keep in mind that during times of perceived stress, soft survey data tends to be more exaggerated than actual hard data. Near-term GDP growth estimates remain positive. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model sees real GDP growth climbing at a 2.6% rate in Q4. The long-term outlook for the stock market remains favorable, bolstered by expectations for years of earnings growth. And earnings are the most important driver of stock prices. Demand for goods and services is positive, and the economy continues to grow. At the same time, economic growth has normalized from much hotter levels earlier in the cycle. The economy is less ""coiled"" these days as major tailwinds like excess job openings have faded. To be clear: The economy remains very healthy, supported by strong consumer and business balance sheets. Job creation remains positive. And the Federal Reserve — having resolved the inflation crisis — has shifted its focus toward supporting the labor market. We are in an odd period given that the hard economic data has decoupled from the soft sentiment-oriented data. Consumer and business sentiment has been relatively poor, even as tangible consumer and business activity continue to grow and trend at record levels. From an investor’s perspective, what matters is that the hard economic data continues to hold up. Analysts expect the U.S. stock market could outperform the U.S. economy, thanks largely due to positive operating leverage. Since the pandemic, companies have adjusted their cost structures aggressively. This has come with strategic layoffs and investment in new equipment, including hardware powered by AI. These moves are resulting in positive operating leverage, which means a modest amount of sales growth — in the cooling economy — is translating to robust earnings growth. Of course, this does not mean we should get complacent. There will always be risks to worry about — such as U.S. political uncertainty, geopolitical turmoil, energy price volatility, cyber attacks, etc. There are also the dreaded unknowns. Any of these risks can flare up and spark short-term volatility in the markets. There’s also the harsh reality that economic recessions and bear markets are developments that all long-term investors should expect to experience as they build wealth in the markets. Always keep your stock market seat belts fastened. For now, there’s no reason to believe there’ll be a challenge that the economy and the markets won’t be able to overcome over time. The long game remains undefeated, and it’s a streak long-term investors can expect to continue.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/allurion-launches-compounded-glp-1-program-as-fda-aims-to-end-access-195139922.html,"Mon, Nov 25, 2024, 12:02 PM","Allurion (ALUR) launched a new program to provide patients access to compounded weight-loss drugs Monday after months of pitching its own weight-loss solution — an ingestible balloon — as an alternative for patients who may not want to use the popular injectable GLP-1 drugs. Allurion CEO Shantanu Gaur told Yahoo Finance that, like others, the company continues to see a spillover effect from the unprecedented interest in GLP-1 drugs like Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Wegovy and Eli Lilly's (LLY) Zepbound. It's why the company is now offering copycat products at a fraction of the cost. Allurion's new program uses artificial intelligence guidance to help patients adhere to a well-rounded diet and exercise routine in addition to using GLP-1s. The AI coach launched in May, and access to compounded semaglutide, the key ingredient in Novo's Wegovy drug, begins Monday. Gaur said the company also has plans to launch tirzepatide, the key ingredient in Lilly's Zepbound. The FDA recently declared an end to the shortage of tirzepatide, which put compounding manufacturers in a 60-day window to end production. The FDA allows copycat drugs to be produced if the branded makers are unable to meet demand — which Gaur and others say is still the case despite the FDA's declaration. Some compounders filed suit against the FDA to allow continued production. The FDA recently delayed its decision on the matter until Dec. 19, keeping access to compounded versions intact for now. Semaglutide, meanwhile, is separately under review by the FDA for its place on the agency's drug shortage list. Novo Nordisk notified the agency it was able to meet demand, and the FDA will make its decision after it reviews the company's data. Allurion's decision to join in the GLP-1 space at this juncture speaks to the ongoing demand for the drugs, despite its an ingestable balloon having similar results to the weight-loss drugs. The device helps regulate a person's food intake, resulting in patients losing up to 15% of their body weight after four months on average. The balloon is not yet available in the US but is approved in other countries. Patients who have tried and failed to lose weight with the GLP-1s or are trying to look for alternatives have become interested in the balloon, Gaur said. ""Last year, 25% of our balloon patients had previously tried a GLP-1,"" he said. ""This year, that number has grown to 33%."" Still, the lack of US approval and the ongoing demand for GLP-1s has pressured the company's stock — which is down 96% to less than $0.50 per share since it de-SPACed and went public in April 2021. The company has been notified it meets the requirements for delisting from the New York Stock Exchange, but Gaur said the company is working on building back. When asked if the decision to join in on the GLP-1 frenzy, was an indication of that, Gaur said, ""We have a plan to address the delisting. The news may help, but the plan is independent of it."" The company's stock fell on the news of the announcement Monday, trading down nearly 3% to $0.41 per share.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/key-fed-inflation-gauge-shows-pce-going-sideways-154948194.html,"Wed, Nov 27, 2024, 7:49 AM","The latest reading of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge showed price increases were flat in October from the prior month, raising questions over whether progress in getting to the central bank's 2% goal has stalled. The core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out food and energy costs and is closely watched by the central bank, rose 0.3% from the prior month during October, in line with Wall Street's expectations for 0.3% and the reading from September. Over the prior year, core prices rose 2.8%, in line with Wall Street's expectations and above the 2.7% seen in September. On a yearly basis, overall PCE increased 2.3%, a pickup from the 2.1% seen in September. ""Core PCE has been going sideways for the last couple of months,"" Paul Gruenwald, S&P Global Ratings global chief economist, told Yahoo Finance.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-a-breakup-could-upend-google-and-the-tech-world-090006524.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 1:00 AM","Google has a lot at stake if the Justice Department succeeds in breaking up its empire, from control over its search data and Android operating system to the loss of its Chrome browser. But the biggest threat the company faces is to a search business that is deeply woven into the technology ecosystem of its parent company Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL). Of the $307.3 billion in revenue Google made in 2023, $175 billion came solely from that ad-driven search engine business. The DOJ wants to impose dozens of limitations on the way that Google connects that engine with consumers. Other parts of Alphabet could also be affected. The DOJ also asked for the company to be prohibited from favoring its video subsidiary, YouTube, which is part of its YouTube Ads business unit. That unit, which generated $31.3 billion in revenue in 2023, earns money through ads that appear on and around YouTube videos. Google search promotes YouTube video links in response user queries. Google's digital ads business, a division that generated $31.5 billion in revenue in 2023, could also be imperiled by a limitation on search favoring YouTube. Advertisers as well as content creators use Google's buyer- and seller-side platforms to target consumers and monetize video content. It will be up to District of Columbia Judge Amit Mehta, who sided with the DOJ’s monopoly argument in a trial that wrapped up earlier this year, to approve any of the proposals submitted by prosecutors. That could include the sale of Google's Chrome browser and a divestment of its Android mobile operating system. Even artificial-intelligence investments designed to pay off in the future could be under threat. Prosecutors also called for Google to divest within six months any investment or ownership in rival query-based AI products, as well as rival search text advertising technology products. That would force Google to unwind its partnership with generative AI startup Anthropic. Google has invested $2 billion in Anthropic, while also hiring the founders of another AI startup, Character.AI. Taken together, the Justice Department’s requests would dramatically alter the tech landscape. Some legal experts said there is a slim chance Mehta will grant all of the prosecutors' proposals. ""I think it's pretty unlikely that the government will be successful in getting these things,"" Columbia Law School antitrust professor Erik Hovenkamp told Yahoo Finance. ""In particular, I do not expect the court to order any divestiture. Contrary to popular misconception, antitrust rarely breaks up monopolies."" The remedy legal experts say is most likely to be granted is a request to prohibit Google from agreements that secure its search engine as the default in browsers and on mobile devices. That could hurt Google partners more than Google itself. One is Apple (APPL). In 2022, Google paid Apple roughly $20 billion for default placement of Google Search on Apple’s Safari browser and to power search access points like the Siri voice assistant. ""Google would not have to pay $20 billion anymore, so they would gain market cap,"" said Jean-Paul Schmetz, chief of ads for search engine rival Brave. ""And that would be super perverted, because suddenly the perpetrator is being compensated."" Cash from Google’s payments falls under Apple’s services segment, which brought in some $78.1 billion in 2022. Eliminating Google’s payments would effectively cut 25% of the services segment’s revenue from that year. Schmetz hypothesized that if Google’s default contracts are prohibited, and no money flows between browsers and its search engines, Apple would stand to lose $500 billion in market cap, and Google would gain $500 billion. ""There would be $23 billion times the multiple of Apple that would just basically stop existing,"" Schmetz said. Another roughly $6 billion flows from Google to a group of browsers, mobile device manufacturers and wireless service providers, including Mozilla, Samsung, Sony, AT&T, Verizon, and T-Mobile. Some experts have doubts the DOJ’s plans will effectively open up the markets for search and mobile. Instead of dismantling Google, the Justice Department should force Google and Big Tech cohorts to be more open and interoperable, said Christian Catalini, founder of the MIT Cryptoeconomics Lab and a research scientist at the MIT Sloan School. ""I think it’s a fool’s errand,"" Catalini told Yahoo Finance. If the DOJ's remedies are denied ""then it’s all for nothing"" but if they are accepted the remedies are probably worse than the underlying issue,"" he added. ""And ironically, there's a lot more that could be done to restore competition in all of these sectors through much simpler measures.” Those measures, he said, could include making it easier for third parties to offer their own payment services and app stores on mobile devices. ""Imagine forcing multiple stores to have the same level of service in the Google ecosystem on mobile,"" Catalini said. Google makes money on ad sales through its Play Store, and takes a 13% cut of app store sales. The company’s Android ecosystem also acts as a flywheel for its ad sales by driving users to Google Search and other services. ""Allowing for different parties to provide payments rather than just the Google payment flow in its app stores, or interpretability in messaging and in the services that platforms like Apple and Google dominate today. I think that would go much [further] in terms of really giving…businesses an opportunity to compete."" Another of the DOJ's proposals is to force Google to sell its internet index at a ""marginal cost"" and to make its search results, ranking signals, and query understanding available to rivals for purchase for 10 years. The proposition is a risky one, according to Schmetz, because if Google is required to make its proprietary search data available it could wipe out Brave Search API and Bing Search API — the two other US search providers that crawl and index the internet. APIs or application programming interfaces provide search results to other search engines. ""Google's price cannot be just the marginal price of providing an API - which is basically zero,"" he said, ""since it would destroy other existing businesses that are thriving."" There’s no guarantee Mehta will agree to move forward with all or even some of the DOJ’s proposed remedies. And Google has said it will appeal the initial antitrust decision. For now, the company has to wait and see how Mehta rules on the penalties, which is expected to happen after a remedies trial scheduled to take place in 2025. Google also faces another antitrust trial that could end with restrictions on its separate ad tech business, if the Justice Department has its way. Prosecutors who brought that case during President Biden's administration have already asked for a judge to force Google to divest Google Ad Manager suite, including its publisher-side ad server, DFP, and its ad exchange, AdX. Closing arguments in that case occurred Monday and a judge is expected to rule before year end.

On Monday, equity strategy teams at Barclays and RBC Capital Markets both issued a year-end target price of 6,600 for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) in 2025. The targets suggest a roughly 10.5% gain in the benchmark index over the next twelve months, about in line with the long-term historical average annual return over the past century. ""The story the data tells us is that another year of solid economic and earnings growth, some political tailwinds, and some additional relief on inflation (which should keep the S&P 500’s P/E elevated) can keep stocks moving higher in the year ahead,"" RBC Capital Markets head of US equity strategy Lori Calvasina wrote in a note to clients on Monday. Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, wrote that with ""inflation continuing to normalize, resilient macro, and Big Tech maintaining EPS growth leadership,"" the S&P 500 should continue its march higher. Barclays' and RBC's targets are the latest forecasts from strategists tracked by Yahoo Finance and the latest that reinforce a general optimism on Wall Street that stocks will continue to rally next year. A highly debated component of these calls, however, has been whether or not 2025 will bring with it a continued broadening of returns outside the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks that led the first 18 months of the bull market rally. Calvasina argued that's the most likely case, falling in line with a recent call from Goldman Sachs that mega caps will see ""narrowing"" outperformance in 2025. Calvasina and her team cited growth as a ""crowded"" trade leading to the potential for more flows into the value side of the market, while also noting that valuations are more attractive outside of the large tech stocks. Additionally, the 2025 earnings outlook continues to point to a slowdown in earnings growth for large-cap tech, while the S&P 493 stocks are expected to see earnings growth accelerate. ""For Value to outperform, in recent years we’ve needed to see GDP run a bit hotter,"" said Calvasina, who sees GDP pacing in a range of 2.1% to 3% in 2025, above the current Bloomberg consensus of 2%. ""We’ve given an edge to the broadening of market leadership or the shift into Value, but think it’s a close call."" Meanwhile, Krishna pointed to the most recent quarter of earnings reports in which Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) all topped Wall Street forecasts as a reason to believe investors might not be optimistic enough about Big Tech's earnings growth in 2025. ""Big Tech is likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was this year,"" Krishna wrote. Still, what that means for price returns in those stocks still remains to be seen. ""The last two earnings seasons have shown that headline EPS [earnings per share] beat-and-raises are not necessarily enough to drive additional share price upside amid concerns over the capital intensiveness of the next leg of growth, a consequence of the AI build out,"" Krishna wrote. ""We believe the potential upside from further AI uptake is not under appreciated, but it comes with a big question mark attached,"" Krishna added. The calls for stocks to run higher also haven't come without warning. RBC's Calvasina still sees an elevated likelihood of a 5%-10% drawdown occurring while the S&P 500 chugs higher to 6,600 at the end of next year. ""We have become increasingly worried about the possibility of a near-term 5-10% pullback in the S&P 500, primarily due to elevated positioning, recent froth in sentiment, and valuation that has gotten a little over its skis for 2024, which leave the S&P 500 vulnerable to bad news and perhaps simply in need of a breather,"" Calvasina wrote. A continued rise in 10-year Treasury yields, further dialing back of Federal Reserve rate cut expectations for 2025, and the rising strength of the US dollar are all headwinds Calvasina is closely tracking.

The current state of the housing market has many people worried — including brothers and housing experts Drew and Jonathan Scott, known for their HGTV show ""The Property Brothers."" Ballooning home prices and rising interest rates have made many hopeful first-time homeowners feel like buying a home is still not attainable. And according to the brothers, a lack of housing supply is the greatest factor preventing people from buying. “Right now, the biggest problem is the inventory is really, really bad,” Jonathan Scott told Brian Sozzi on Yahoo Finance’s Opening Bid podcast (see video above or listen below). He noted that the US's housing inventory is about 4.5 million homes short of ""healthy market"" levels. “When you don't have a healthy inventory of homes, that's probably the biggest driver [of unaffordability] because competition is what drives prices up and down,” he added. Though the Federal Reserve began cutting short-term interest rates, totaling three-quarters of a percentage point since September, mortgage rates have continued to tick upward. When the Fed announced its first cut of this cycle in September, 15-year mortgage rates were at a 52-week low of 5.15%; now the same fixed-rate mortgage sits at 6.02%, per Freddie Mac. 30-year mortgage rates have similarly increased in that time frame and are three-quarters of a percentage point higher than they were two months ago. Read more: How the Federal Reserve rate decision affects mortgage rates It’s not just the present real estate market that has the brothers concerned. “My fear is that in 20 years, our kids won't be able to afford to buy a house,” Jonathan Scott said. “Nobody will be able to get into the market because it's going to be so crazy expensive. We need to start tackling that problem now.” Though the brothers admitted it’s “healthier” for the market when interest rates come down, Jonathan predicted that lenders may introduce new products to “incentivize” young homeowners, noting that these products may come with strings that could leave homeowners paying off their mortgages for a longer period of time. “Lean on the fact that lenders want you to get their products — they want to lend you the money, they're going to come out with products that are going to make it a little more accessible,” Jonathan said. “Though, the problem is they’re going to extend the amortization period so it's going to take you longer to pay off that investment.” Though it may not immediately address the issue of housing inventory, the brothers’ Healthy Home Innovation Fund, in partnership with Groundbreak Ventures, aims to offer solutions to other consistent problems in the market. The fund backs potential products and innovations that aim to “offset the housing crisis” by lowering costs for homeowners, renters, builders, and more. Beyond that kind of support, the brothers encouraged prospective buyers to approach homeownership more creatively.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-trump-gets-away-with-tariffs-194608673.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 11:46 AM","The idea should be politically disqualifying: Imposing tariffs on imports raises prices paid by American consumers and businesses. No politician should be able to tell voters he’ll raise their costs, and receive their blessing. Yet Donald Trump does. He campaigned in the 2024 presidential race by promising aggressive new levies on imports from basically everywhere and won a convincing electoral college victory. Voters don’t seem to think Trump’s tariffs will harm them. Trump is now moving fast to put his tariffs into place once he takes office in January. He says one of his first-day priorities will be slapping a 25% tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada, and a new 10% levy on goods from China. Those are America’s top three trading partners, and they ship about $1.3 trillion in goods to the United States each year. If those taxes go into effect, they’d raise the cost of those imports by about $236 billion. Most economists say across-the-board tariffs impede efficiency, depress growth, and kill jobs. The Peterson Institute for International Economics estimates Trump’s full tariff plan would cost the typical household $2,600 per year in higher costs. Voters say, meh. Why the disconnect? Three reasons. First, tariffs are confusing. A recent Morning Consult poll asked voters about their views on tariffs and found that many people don’t even know what they are, exactly. Only 25% correctly said a tariff is a fee a US company pays to the US government to import a product. Sixty percent incorrectly said the foreign company or the foreign government pays the fee, and 15% said they don’t know. So most Americans mistakenly think somebody other than Americans pays the tariffs. Read more: How do tariffs work, and who really pays them? Yet 56% of Americans think US companies and consumers bear the majority of the costs imposed by tariffs. And they’re split on whether tariffs would be good or bad for the US economy. Thirty-eight percent think a 20% tariff would be good for the economy, while 41% think it would be bad, and 21% don’t know. The overall picture is that Americans have a poor understanding of tariffs and, not surprisingly, are conflicted about what they’re likely to accomplish. Second, Americans don’t feel like Trump’s tariffs caused any harm during his first term, when he placed new taxes on steel and aluminum imports and about half of all imports from China. Those tariffs did cause limited harm by raising costs to some US producers. But that came at a relatively benign time for the economy, when inflation was low and the massive COVID-era supply chain disruptions hadn’t happened yet. Trump also crafted those first-term tariffs in a way that raised the cost of intermediate goods, such as components, while keeping finished retail products off the list. Producers saw the price hikes but managed workarounds — such as getting components from Vietnam instead of China — that limited the impact felt by final purchasers, aka American shoppers. There was one exception: washing machines. Trump placed a 20% tariff on imported washing machines, which promptly raised the price of laundry equipment by 12% and boosted the profits of manufacturers. That’s a template for what’s likely to happen in Trump’s second term if he directly tariffs finished consumer goods. Third, Trump tends to threaten much larger tariffs than he actually imposes. When running for president in 2016, for instance, he said he might impose a 45% tariff on all Chinese imports. As president, however, he levied tariffs ranging from 7.5% to 25% on just half of Chinese imports, while exempting most finished consumer products. Trump watchers now understand that he threatens tariffs as a negotiating tactic. “While Trump is the 'Tariff Man' and will be willing to see through these proposals, we also see him as prepared and willing to back down in exchange for key policy concessions,” financial firm Raymond James explained in a Nov. 25 analysis. “The announcement of the tariffs — almost two months before Trump is sworn into office — should be viewed as a play to bring Mexico, Canada, and China to the negotiating table fairly early on."" Trump wants China to crack down on illegal fentanyl shipments to the United States. He wants Mexico to do the same and also get better control of migrants passing through the country as they try to cross the US southwest border. It’s not clear what he wants from Canada, but he’ll assuredly come up with something. Economists versed in the unhappy history of tariffs worry that Trump will overplay his hand and tank the US economy. To many Americans, however, tariffs are an arcane concept that Trump uses to heckle adversaries with little impact on everyday life. If we’re lucky, it’ll stay that way.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/donald-trump-lays-down-his-first-marker-on-tariffs-what-happens-next-could-be-unpredictable-153519273.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 7:35 AM","It took almost three weeks for Donald Trump to provide an unmistakable signal that he is serious about fulfilling his tariff promises, setting up a likely flurry of diplomatic and legal maneuverings in the months to come. The president-elect on Monday night announced plans for both a 25% blanket tariff on Mexico and Canada and new 10% duties on China ""above any additional tariffs."" The stated reason for these new proposed duties are drugs and illegal immigration, with the president-elect surprising many observers by targeting all three of the top US trading partners even before he takes the oath of office. The move was met by immediate resistance, with a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in the U.S. posting that ""no one will win a trade war."" But as even Trump himself signaled, there are a lot of steps to come between last night's dinnertime posts and these duties actually being in place. ""Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long simmering problem,"" Trump noted of his North American plans. Here's what could be coming in the weeks ahead: The first order of business is likely to be an intense bout of back and forth between these three nations and Trump's transition team. In fact, Reuters reported Tuesday that Trump quickly held a conversation with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau after issuing the threat in an apparent opening of talks. A representative for the Trump transition didn't immediately confirm that the call had taken place or whether the president-elect has spoken to other leaders in recent hours. But the talks are sure to be in the offing soon either way, and that's a moment global nations appear to have been preparing for since Trump's victory. Adam Posen, the president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, noted in a recent digital event before the announcement that many governments ""are making plans to sort of preemptively make offers of various kinds to the Trump administration"" as a way to lessen tariffs threats. Posen listed Canada in his talk as one of the nations ""likely lining up offers"" and suggested things like increased energy purchases or moving production inside the US could be on the table. It was a strategy that some nations also employed, to some success, the last time Trump was in office. The question is whether any smaller concessions satisfy Trump and his team and allow them to declare victory and back away from the larger threat. The incoming president's initial demand is for all drugs and illegal immigration to cease from the three countries. That is likely impossible. And the stakes are high with China, Mexico, and Canada representing America largest trading partners by far. The top three exporters to the U.S. in 2022 were China ($536.3 billion), Mexico ($454.8 billion), Canada ($436.6 billion), according to the US Trade Representative. In addition, the top three purchasers of American goods are those same three countries, just in a different order. Canada alone is the recipient of 17.3% of total U.S. goods exports. Joseph Lavorgna, a former Trump economic aide who remains allied with the president-elect as a senior fellow at the America First Policy Institute, added in a Yahoo Finance Live appearance Tuesday morning that ""there's certainly a transactional component"" to Trump's announcement. He also suggested some countries, specifically China, may need to offer more concessions to avoid the duties, adding that tariffs are ""a key tool in getting the next administration's agenda done."" Perhaps the next question — if Trump doesn't extract concessions to his liking — will be whether the US political and legal system would allow him to proceed. What Trump promised in this week's post is to move to implement that tariffs on day one but stopped short of promising they would be in effect immediately On inauguration day ""I will sign all necessary documents,"" he said. His likely authority for such a move is a 1977 law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, which Trump aides have long discussed as a means to move quickly. The law could be notably well suited to actions against specific countries. William Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said in a recent interview that the law gives extensive powers and ""it works better when there's a targeted offender."" But there's a catch. ""No matter what he does, he'll be sued,"" Reinsch added, suggesting that companies would immediately try to block the move through the courts. The legal challenges around duties on Mexico and Canada could be even more complex because of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) that Trump himself signed into law in 2020. New tariffs would appear to violate that pact which aimed to continue the largely free flow of goods between the three nations. A move could give companies greater grounds to sue. But new tariffs aimed at specific nations (as opposed to blanket duties) could have significant legal protections. Another analysis from Alan Wolff at the Peterson Institute for International Economics explaining the President has considerable powers and ""the courts could go along with additional retaliation but not tariffs on everything from everywhere."" Yet if any duties come into effect, the impact would surely be dramatic for a range of industries from automakers, farmers, to manufacturers. The effect on energy could also be deeply felt with new tariffs on Canada likely to impact energy imports from the north unless exceptions are made. ""A 25% tariff on Canadian oil would have huge impacts,"" noted energy analyst Patrick De Haan Monday night. Ben Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.

For the 12th consecutive quarter, the retailer posted negative same-store sales growth, down 2.9% year over year versus estimates of a 0.92% decline. Net sales of $9.45 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $1.26 also missed expectations of $9.63 billion and $1.29 per share, respectively. Best Buy CEO Corie Barry attributed the miss to ""a combination of overall ongoing macro uncertainty, customers waiting for deals and sales, and distraction during the run-up to the election, particularly in nonessential categories"" in an earnings call. In the quarter, appliance and entertainment sales dropped 14.7% and 18.8%, respectively, compared to estimates of declines of 7.5% and 4%. Consumer electronics sales declined 5.8%. Computing and mobile phone sales gained 3.80%, while services revenue was up 6%, both slightly beating estimates. The company expects same-store sales growth for the fourth quarter to be flat to down 3%, slashing optimistic views that demand was stabilizing post-pandemic. ""Fourth quarter sales [are] a sequential improvement,"" Barry told reporters in a media call. ""We like what we're seeing early in the holiday — a little bit better than our expectations."" This year, the company kicked off Black Friday sales a week early as consumers hunt for value. Best Buy stock fell 7% in early trading. As of the market close on Monday, shares were up nearly 19% year to date, trailing behind the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 25% gain. Here's what Best Buy posted for the third quarter, compared to Bloomberg consensus data estimates: Adjusted earnings per share: $1.26 versus $1.29 Net sales: $9.45 billion versus $9.63 billion Same-store sales growth overall: -2.9% versus -0.92% Total US same-store sales growth: -2.8% versus versus -1.04% Sales growth for: Appliances: -14.7% versus -7.5% Entertainment: -18.8% versus -4% Consumer electronics: -5.8% versus -2.72% Computing and mobile phones: 3.8% versus 3.5% Services: 6% versus 5.83% International: -3.7% versus -0.57% The company updated its full-year outlook. Same-store sales are projected to decline 2.5% to 3.5%. That's compared to a previously expected decline of 1.5% to 3%. Revenue for the year is projected at $41.1 billion to $41.5 billion, lower than the previous range of $41.3 billion to $41.9 billion. Earnings per share guidance was updated to a range of $6.10 to $6.25, compared to a previous range of $6.10 to $6.35. Barry said the company is at a turning point, as ""layers of pressures that have been on the business,"" such as inflation, the housing market, consumers spending on experiences, and lack of new products, start to change. Prior to the earnings release, analysts had expected new technologies to boost Best Buy's results. ""The company should see a return to growth in the first half of 2025, following many consecutive quarters of negative comps, as newness and the replacement cycle kicks in, especially for products purchased in 2019-2020,"" Telsey Advisory Group's Joe Feldman wrote in a note to clients. Copilot+ PCs, which can access advanced AI models, launched earlier this year with roughly 40 products. In the previous quarter, Barry said the company is the exclusive retailer for about 40% of those new PCs. Barry said she views AI ""more as a two- or three-year ... steady replacement [and] innovation combination that helps buoy this part of the industry."" Jason Bonfig, the chief merchandising officer of Best Buy, said on the earnings call that there will be new AI features across platforms like Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Google (GOOG). The rollout has been gradual as consumers upgrade and replace their existing devices. Bonfig expects that to ""continue into next year as we think about the end-of-life support of Windows 10 that happens in October 2025.""

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/did-you-say-youd-leave-the-country-if-trump-were-elected-pro-tip-its-not-easy-090022948.html,"Mon, Nov 25, 2024, 1:00 AM","A lot of people said they’d leave the US if Donald Trump got reelected. I actually did it. And here's my story — and some advice if you're actually thinking about it. First, a little background. I started the process three years ago and finally left our home near Bloomington, Ind., in September. Yes, before Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris. But it was a factor in our decision, a Plan B in case he got elected. We were not alone, apparently. The expat facilitation firm Expatsi saw its daily click rate go from its normal 2,000 or so a day to 142,000 on the day after the election. But the big question for me and my wife, of course, was where to go. There are lots of options for those who are tired of the US political climate — the Caribbean, Latin America, Europe, Asia, and even New Zealand. Our new home will be in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. We chose Cabo for a few reasons. For one thing, it is spectacularly beautiful. Miles and miles of empty beaches, breathtaking desertscapes, and Georgia O’Keefe purple mountains. Also, it’s convenient (although not close) to our grandkids on the West Coast. Finally, it’s a place friends and family can and will visit. Having had homes in N.Y., L.A., Sydney, and rural Indiana, we know firsthand that there are some places people want to visit and some that require some selling. An added bonus for Los Cabos is safety: Cabo has about the same crime rate as Dallas. But Mexico isn't perfect politically. It too has issues with corruption, cronyism, and populism. In fact, there is no place that checks all the boxes in terms of climate, proximity, cost of living, safety, medical care, and politics. If you’re a conservative, you’re not going to like Mexico’s newly elected President Claudia Sheinbaum, who’s well to the left of AOC. If you’re liberal, you’ll find right-wing populism is a global trend. For example, every European country has its own version of MAGA: Poland, France, Italy, Portugal, and even the Netherlands and Scandinavian countries. Moving overseas is not easy. And it’s not cheap: It cost roughly $30,000 for us because we either had to bring furniture and household goods with us or buy new. We’ve tried both options on other moves and found it works out about the same. For us, it was a two-step process. First, we “redomiciled”: that is, we changed our home base in the US. A home base can literally be a home or it could be a mailing address at one of the many companies that provide those services for expats and RV-ers. However you do it, it’s necessary to have some sort of footprint. There are still a handful of institutions that insist on using physical mail. We chose Houston because it’s got great healthcare — my wife and I are over 65 — and is an easy flight from Cabo. And Texas has no income tax, while Bloomington, Ind., where we last lived, is over 5%. The hardest thing is the paperwork. There's a ton of it, and it all hits you at once — visas, doctors, licenses, change of address, banks, phone numbers, insurance, utilities, you name it. In our case, it hit twice: Indiana to Texas, and Texas to Mexico. Both were bad. In online forums, people talk about how quick and easy it is to establish yourself in Texas, but that wasn’t our experience. It took three trips to the DMV because we’d not yet received the title to our new Texas car — and the bill of sale and application for title weren’t enough. Perhaps times have changed. Because of Homeland Security, for one, there are a lot of checks and rechecks in the system these days. Example: it’s no longer simple to get a safety deposit box because banks are concerned about people using them to stash things like illegal drugs. Now it requires several forms of ID and an interview — if you can find a bank that still has them. And while Mexican bureaucrats are more pleasant than those at the DMV, they’re still bureaucrats. Getting our residency cards, sort of like a green card, took months and three in-person interviews. The US paperwork was in English and used familiar terms. The Mexican paperwork was mostly in Spanish. My Spanish is good enough for the local fruitería, but it’s not good enough for legal transactions. For the final step of the residency process, we ended up using an immigration lawyer. About language. You’ll hear that everyone in Cabo speaks English. That’s baloney, unless by “everyone” you mean waiters in restaurants at resorts. Even if people can speak some English, they don’t always want to. For many, speaking English is work. If you don’t speak at least a little Spanish, you won’t be able to participate in the local culture, which is a big reason to live outside your home country. Expats live in an in-between world. Certainly not tourists, but not locals either. Yes, in theory, you can live in a shack on the beach like Andy Dufresne in ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and eat beans and tortillas for 10 bucks a day. But you probably won’t. You’ll live in a nice, safe neighborhood. You’ll eat out frequently. You’ll use services like gardening and cleaning. The net result is that it’s cheaper than the US, but not dirt cheap. Cellular service, car insurance, property taxes, domestic help, veterinarians, dentists, and internet are all much cheaper. Homes are cheaper than in California, but more expensive than in Indiana. Electricity, water, many of the brands you’re familiar with, most durable goods, and Amazon cost more. (Yes, Amazon will ship to you in Mexico. They add customs duty to the price.) Here’s a real example. This week, we ate at a special occasion restaurant called Jazamango. For three people, with appetizers, drinks, and mains, it cost $180. That same meal in the US would cost at least $250. Now, that was a pretty high-end meal, but in general, that’s about the way it works — maybe 30% less gives you a lifestyle equivalent to the US. It’s like a vacation, but not like a vacation. My favorite example is laundry. Who does laundry on vacation? Nobody I know. Living somewhere means dealing with laundry, grocery shopping, utilities, watch repairs — all the daily minutiae of life. Each of those activities, however simple, takes a little more effort when you’re in an unfamiliar place. In the States, I’d automatically toss a box of Ritz crackers into the cart. Here it’s a decision. Splurge for the imported brand, which might be stale anyway, or go with the local brand, Crackets? Those little differences that are so charming and piquant during a three-week vacation can become irritating after three months. Every once in a while, those petty irritations build up — drip drip drip — until your emotional teacup is ready to spill over, and you want to shout, “Why can't they put the fabric softener in the aisle where it's SUPPOSED to be?"" However, by far the biggest challenge is that being an expat is life without a net. Mexico has excellent doctors, and they’re much cheaper than US doctors. But Medicare only works in the US, and once you pass 70, the cost of private Mexican insurance is prohibitive. That means having to create workarounds, like timing doctor appointments with visits to the States and paying out of pocket for some medical services. There’s always the risk of a sudden hospitalization, which can cost five figures, or even more for an expensive medevac. There’s another risk that isn’t often discussed: the legal framework. In the US, citizens have basic rights like free speech, property rights, an expectation of equal and fair treatment before the police and judiciary, access to government services, etc. Many of these rights do not exist in other countries (e.g., free speech in Mexico isn't as broad as in the US, and don’t even think about a handgun). And having rights is not the same as being able to exercise them. Laws and regulations are made for the people who live there and vote. To the extent those laws protect visitors, it’s incidental. Not that this is unique to Mexico. Ask anyone caught up in the immigration mess at our Southern border about the right to a speedy trial. Or, for that matter, ask anyone who’s ever bought a vacation home in small-town America and tried to get a building permit through the local zoning board. Outsiders don’t get the same treatment as locals. It’s human nature to assume the rules are the same as back home. They’re not. And you’re most likely to find that out at the worst possible time. This is my third time as an expat. I like the challenge of negotiating my way through an unfamiliar culture. Yes, the politics are far from perfect, but it's not as grating when they're not your politics. The language barrier turns the background noise down. And the story the Cabo realtors sell you — sun, cost of living, culture, food, lovely people — is all true. But it’s also not the whole story. Being an expat comes with challenges and risks, even in a place with 365 days of sunshine and cheap margaritas. Sam Hill is a former business executive for Kraft, Booz Allen, DMB&B, and FTI Consulting. Besides all that, he's managed to find the time to write, or co-write, three business books, including the national bestseller ""Radical Marketing,"" a couple of novels, and dozens of pieces for the likes of Fortune, Bloomberg, the FT, Newsweek, and the Harvard Business Review.","A lot of people said they’d the US Trump got reelected.

An employee responsible for small package delivery expense accounting intentionally made ""erroneous accounting accrual entries"" that hid nearly $132 million to $154 million from Q4 2021 through the fiscal quarter that ended Nov. 2, 2024, the company said. Macy's said the employee was no longer with the company and there was ""no indication that the accounting error had any impact on the cash management activities or vendor payments."" America's largest department store was expected to post its Q3 earnings report on Tuesday before the market open. In its preliminary results, same-store sales were down 1.3%, slightly better than expectations. Macy's stock dropped 3% as investors digested the expense error and preliminary results. ""The preliminary numbers basically match exactly what people were looking for,"" Morningstar analyst David Swartz told Yahoo Finance over the phone, adding that the latest news was disappointing but not a major issue. ""Macy's has over $8 billion a year in operating expenses, so even if it's $50 million a year underreported, that's immaterial for Macy's, that would be less than 1% of Macy's annual expenses."" ""From what we know with the limited amount [of information] ... a rogue employee did something wrong,"" Swartz said. ""Why it was not caught earlier is certainly a question that will be asked because this should not happen, but it does happen sometimes."" Net sales of $4.74 billion came in slightly below the $4.75 billion expected. The company did not report adjusted earnings per share, which Wall Street expects to come in at a loss of $0.01. ""While we work diligently to complete the investigation as soon as practicable and ensure this matter is handled appropriately, our colleagues across the company are focused on serving our customers and executing our strategy for a successful holiday season,"" chairman and CEO Tony Spring said in the release. The company said it plans to provide its fourth quarter and full-year outlook by Dec. 11, 2024, ""to allow for completion of the independent investigation."" Given the microscope Macy's is under, especially after Macy's ended talks with activist investor Arkhouse and Brigade Capital Management in July, Burt Flickinger III of Strategic Resource Group believes the company should create a ""special investigation headed by trusted recent executive officers."" That includes former Macy's CFO and executive vice president Karen Hoguet, who served in the role from 1997 until she retired in 2019. She now serves on Kroger's (KR) board of directors. Elisa Garcia, who was formerly Macy's chief legal officer and retired last October, is another top choice of his, and Dan Reidy, who retired from Jones Day Law LLP. Flickinger said ""Karen and [Elisa] will be very decisive but also efficient and effective while minimizing investigative costs."" However, investors should note the investigation seems to be underway already. Shares of Macy's have dropped 20% year to date to $16 per share, far below the $24.80 per share buyout offer they rejected from Arkhouse and Brigade. Here's what Macy's shared in its preliminary Q3 results, compared to Bloomberg consensus estimates: Net sales: $4.74 billion versus $4.75 billion expected Adjusted earnings per share: Not reported versus a loss of $0.01 Same-store sales: -1.3% versus -1.49% The earnings developments come as Macy's works on its Bold New Chapter Strategy. In the first 50 stores, where it has made investments in staffing, product assortment, and visual displays, same-store sales grew for the third straight quarter, up 1.9% year-over-year, compared to 0.8% growth in the previous quarter. ""You have different consumers looking for different things,"" CEO Tony Spring said at Yahoo Finance's Invest conference earlier this month. Shoppers are looking for ""newness,"" benefiting its luxury business, while other consumers are ""looking for great value"" and overall experience. As part of the strategy, the company plans to close 55 stores in 2024 and 150 by 2026 while investing in its remaining locations. In Q3, the company saw asset sale gains of $66 million, compared to $61 million last year. ""We continue to believe that paring down the Macy's store base to a more manageable (and profitable) size is prudent given structural shifts,"" Dana Telsey of Telsey Advisory Group wrote in a note to clients. As the company closes its ""lowest-performing stores"" and ""store upgrades are implemented in the others,"" same-store sales are expected to improve, Swartz wrote in a client note. — Brooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The loan, part of the DOE’s Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) program, would support the construction of Rivian’s upcoming assembly plant located outside of Atlanta. Rivian paused development of the site back in March due to concerns about its capital position. At the time, Rivian said building its upcoming R2 vehicles at its existing Normal, Ill., plant instead would save the company over $2 billion in costs. If finalized, the new DOE loan would restart Rivan’s plans to develop the Georgia assembly plant. Rivian stock was up over 3% in midday trade, but rolled over into the close and finished down 0.43%. ""This loan would enable Rivian to more aggressively scale our US manufacturing footprint for our competitively priced R2 and R3 vehicles that emphasize both capability and affordability,” CEO RJ Scaringe said in a statement. “A robust ecosystem of US companies developing and manufacturing EVs is critical for the US to maintain its long-term leadership in transportation."" Rivian said it must satisfy certain technical, legal, environmental, and financial conditions before the DOE enters into the loan agreement. If finalized, Rivian said it would build the facility in two phases, each resulting in 200,000 units of annual production capacity, for a total of 400,000 units of annual capacity, which Rivian claims would support the “sale of American EVs in international markets.” Phase 1 of the project is expected to start production in 2028. In the meantime, Rivian will continue to pursue building its volume R2 and R3 vehicles at the Normal plant, with production slated for the first half of 2026. Rivian notes that other American automakers have taken advantage of similar government-backed loan programs, including Tesla (TSLA), GM (GM), and Ford (F), including battery supply chain companies like Redwood Materials and Lithium Americas. Rivian securing conditional approval of the $6.6 billion DOE loan comes on the heels of another big financial win for the company. In mid-November, the company announced an expansion of its partnership with Volkswagen (VWAGY), with the German automaker pouring more money into a joint venture. Volkswagen will increase its total deal investment to $5.8 billion from $5 billion. The joint venture will begin operations in North America and eventually expand to Europe. It will also support the development of electric vehicles in the subcompact segment, the companies said. In terms of its cash cushion, Rivian said it ended the third quarter with $7.85 billion in cash and equivalents, and the company said at the time it still expects ""to reach a modest gross profit"" in the fourth quarter of this year. One big wrinkle in that plan is the status of the federal EV tax credit, which the incoming Trump transition team has indicated may be repealed. Pure-play automakers like Rivian, Lucid (LCID), and Tesla could be most affected by the tax credit’s removal. Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/beware-the-scott-bessent-bump-in-markets-204627517.html,"Mon, Nov 25, 2024, 12:46 PM","President-elect Donald Trump's Treasury secretary pick, Scott Bessent, was expected by some to reignite the post-election rally that led to one of the best post-election equity rallies of all time. Bessent was the consensus pick on Wall Street, which perhaps contributed to why Elon Musk called him the “business-as-usual” candidate for the job. Stocks rose after the long-awaited announcement and yields pulled back slightly. But some investors are already cautioning that any relief rally could be short-lived, as Trump’s personnel picks still leave questions about economic policy under Trump 2.0. ""This was a good pick,"" Jason Furman, a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government and former economic adviser to President Barack Obama, told Yahoo Finance. ""He's mainstream. He knows a lot about the world of finance.” ""The bigger issue, though, is that the main calls on the economy are going to be President Trump's,"" Furman added. Pangaea Policy founder Terry Haines published a note Monday cautioning that Trump appears to be casting a “team of rivals” on economic policy, meaning “Trump’s economic policy isn’t a settled thing.” That team of rivals includes Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, two Washington outsiders tapped to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a new agency Trump and Musk came up with during a live conversation on X. Furman added that the market is “ahead of itself” on the idea that Bessent will be able to curb any inflationary policies, noting he is “skeptical” of cost-cutting to come. ""President Trump sent us a bit of signal about how he'd make those calls with this pick, but he hasn't sent us any signals that he's given up on large across-the-board tariffs,"" Furman said. ""And until I hear that, I'm going to be nervous."" Trump has promised a 60% tariff on Chinese goods. Costs from tariffs, which are taxes paid by companies when goods are imported from overseas, are largely passed down to consumers, which is why dozens of Nobel Laureates have warned that Trump’s tariff policies would be inflationary. “Big ticket items like tariffs, like immigration policy, all that's still coming out of the Oval Office,” said Isaac Boltansky, director of policy research at BTIG. “This is still going to be a presidency that is driven by what Trump wants and when Trump wants it.” Read more: How do tariffs work, and who really pays them? In an interview on Yahoo Finance in July, Bessent himself said that Trump's 60% tariff line wasn’t too serious. “That's the beginning of a maximalist negotiating position,” Bessent said at the time, “and that's the way President Trump negotiates.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/new-fafsa-launches-early-to-cautiously-positive-reception-110040926.html,"Wed, Nov 27, 2024, 3:00 AM","Applying for financial aid looks like it’ll be a much less bumpy process for college-bound students and their parents this coming academic year compared to the glitch-filled debacle that roiled the higher education world in 2024. The Department of Education opened its latest version of the Free Application For Student Aid — better known as the FAFSA — to the public last week, slightly ahead of its original Dec. 1 deadline. The early debut appeared to be a sign of confidence that the agency had mostly worked out the many technical bugs that marred last year’s rollout of a simplified version of the form, which millions of students fill out annually. Organizations that work with families and financial aid administrators told Yahoo Finance that the FAFSA does mostly appear to be working as intended this time around, with some students reporting that the process only took 10 or 15 minutes to complete. Still, they said that the form could still use some tweaking. “We are feeling good that students can go in and can apply for financial aid, which last year they couldn’t,” said Jill Desjean, a senior policy analyst at the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators. “Are we saying everything is perfect and there is no work to be done? No, there is still work to be done.” Last year’s botched FAFSA process has been a lingering embarrassment for President Biden’s Department of Education, which was tasked with revamping the form under legislation passed by Congress in 2020. The bill reduced the number of questions on the application from 108 to a maximum of 36 while exempting some families from needing to report their assets, among other changes. That prompted the department to undertake a top-down rebuild of the ancient database systems used to manage its financial aid program, a difficult task that led to a host of technical problems. Many students found they were unable to complete the form when it finally rolled out several months late, and millions of calls to the department’s understaffed customer service center went unanswered. With students left in limbo, some schools were forced to roll back their acceptance deadlines. A Government Accountability Office report noted that the problems also appear to have contributed to 9% fewer first-time applicants submitting FAFSAs, “with the largest declines among lower-income students.” For the newly updated form, the Biden administration undertook several rounds of beta testing to make sure its latest version of the form was working properly and catch last-minute bugs. On a press call last week, department officials said they had already processed 167,000 applications for the coming year, and that 95% of testers reported that they were “satisfied with the experience.” They said the agency also added 700 call center workers to field questions. “I'm proud to say FAFSA is up and running, and millions more students can have access to federal aid to pursue their dreams,” Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona told reporters. Groups that work directly with students to complete the FAFSA told Yahoo Finance that the process has largely been going smoothly. William Wozniak, vice president of marketing at INvestED, described it as “infinitely better” than last year’s application season. The student lender was one of the organizations tapped for beta testing and has since worked with hundreds of additional families to finish the form, he said. “So many of the glitches that were experienced last time were not occurring, where the form would lock up or the form would go down,” Wozniak said. “It just got so much better.” One of the groups worst affected by last year’s problems was students with undocumented parents who lacked Social Security numbers. The department’s automatic system was often unable to verify their identities, forcing them to send in documentation for a lengthy manual verification process. Education officials announced a temporary fix in the spring, which they extended to the coming year. Alyssa Samuel, a staffer at the Scholarship Fund for Alexandria, in Alexandria, Va., said that the process has been vastly easier for the large number of students in such mixed-status families her organization, which was also involved in beta testing, works with. “We’ve had overwhelmingly positive experiences with the application,” she said, later adding that “we’re not really pulling our hair out.” Still, some student aid officials and parents have run into glitches. NASFAA’s Desjean said there still appear to be problems with some of the FAFSA’s prompts and that some graduate students continue to receive messages informing them they might be eligible for Pell grants, which only undergraduates can actually apply for. The new FAFSA is also supposed to be able to automatically port over a parent’s tax information, sparing them the hassle of manually inputting it line by line. David Merryman, a professor at Vanderbilt University, said the tool didn’t work when he went to help his daughter fill out the application. Even so, he said the process was relatively straightforward and only took 35 minutes total. “We had heard how terrible it was so we were really worried about it,” he said. “But it was really easy.” The tax importing tool didn’t seem to work either for Jelena Subotic, a mother in Atlanta, who said she gave up on the form after it crashed 30 minutes into filling in her portion. She said she’d noticed it had also flipped her son’s and husband’s Social Security numbers. She plans to try again in a couple of weeks. “I’m just thinking it’ll be fixed in time so I can get it done,” she said. “But it is annoying — I wasted half an hour.” Jordan Weissmann is a senior reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dei-rollback-reaches-walmart-as-backlash-mounts-170752208.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 9:07 AM","Walmart (WMT) is scaling back some of its diversity initiatives, becoming one of the most prominent companies yet to make such an about-face as activist pressure mounts. The world's largest retail chain told Yahoo Finance that it would cease using the acronym DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion), no longer participate in a corporate equality rating system created by the Human Rights Campaign, and end its $100 million Center for Racial Equity that was scheduled to be sunsetted in 2025. The company will also remove from its available merchandise all sexual and transgender products marketed to children, review its supplier diversity program to ensure that no preferences are made based on race, and stop using the term ""LatinX"" in official communications to refer to people of Latin American cultural or ethnic identities. A spokesman for Walmart said the changes did not come about suddenly. ""We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging, to open doors to opportunities for all our associates, customers and suppliers and to be a Walmart for everyone,"" the company said in a statement. Similar changes discarding DEI initiatives have been picking up momentum at other major US corporations in recent months as critics target what they describe as ""woke"" policies. Home improvement giant Lowe’s (LOW), rural retailer Tractor Supply (TSCO), and tractor maker John Deere (DE) also announced retreats from DEI policies last summer. Harley-Davidson (HOG), Jack Daniel’s maker Brown-Forman (BF-A), Polaris (PII), and its motorcycle subsidiary, Indian Motorcycle, are among the other recent pullbacks. Conservative activist Robby Starbuck has said many of these discarded diversity initiatives happened after he communicated plans to ""expose"" woke policies. He did so again on Monday with Walmart, saying in a post on X that he told executives at the retailer that he was ""doing a story on wokeness there"" and that he and Walmart ""had productive conversations to find solutions."" Citing the company's changes, he added that ""this is the biggest win yet for our movement to end wokeness in corporate America."" A US Supreme Court ruling last year has been cited as a factor in corporate decisions to alter diversity policies. The court specifically ruled against race-conscious student admissions programs at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina, saying the programs violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Republican-led states have pushed companies to rescind race-based employee quotas, piggybacking on that 2023 high court decision. DEI was also a hot-button issue during the 2024 presidential campaign. A top Trump ally has called DEI ""bigotry"" against white men. That ally, Stephen Miller, has been named deputy chief of policy in President-elect Donald Trump's new administration.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-new-tariff-threats-show-he-doesnt-see-allies-only-adversaries-191714731.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 11:17 AM","President-elect Donald Trump announced his day-one intentions for tariffs on three of the United States' top trading partners late Monday. In a post on his social media platform Truth Social, Trump said he would pass an executive order on his first day in office imposing a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico as well as a 10% tariff on goods from China ""above any additional tariffs."" A reminder to investors that the incoming president once described himself as a ""tariff man"" and appears not to have lost this enthusiasm. ""Trump doesn't see allies, only adversaries,"" Stephen Brown, deputy chief North America economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a research note Tuesday morning. ""Now it's Canada and Mexico in the firing line, but Europe could easily catch the next stray bullet."" ""This Tariff will remain in effect until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!"" Trump wrote. ""Both Mexico and Canada have the absolute right and power to easily solve this long simmering problem."" Migration across the US-Mexico border has fallen sharply in 2024 since its dramatic increase last year. ""The implication seems to be that the countries could avoid these tariffs by presenting credible plans to take action to reduce drug supply or secure their borders, much like how Mexico staved off a similar threat from Trump in 2019,"" Brown wrote. Read more: How do tariffs work, and who really pays them? Trump's tariff threats may also face legal challenges, as Yahoo Finance’s Ben Werschkul noted Tuesday. His tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada would potentially violate the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) he signed into law in 2020, though the trade deal between the countries is up for renegotiation in 2026. And unlike blanket tariffs, duties aimed at specific countries have strong legal protections. Still, Brown noted, ""Existing free trade agreements won't save countries from Trump’s cable-news wrath."" On Tuesday, shares of American automakers suffered, with General Motors (GM) stock falling 8.5% while Stellantis (STLA) dropped 5.5% and Ford (F) slipped 2.3%. European automakers Volkswagen (VWAGY), Mercedes (MBGAF), and BMW (BMW.DE) also saw declines as the tariff threats raised questions about the future of their operations in Mexico. Trump's 2018 tariffs on steel and aluminum imports cut into the profits of automakers such as Ford and General Motors. A Federal Reserve study found these tariffs also led to a reduction in manufacturing jobs. American retailers such as Walmart (WMT) and Lowe's (LOW) have also been bracing for potential impacts on their production costs. Others have reiterated their support for Chinese operations amid these tariff threats, with Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook saying during his visit to China this week, ""I value [Apple's partners in China] very highly. We could not do what we do without them."" Apple manufactures most of its iPhones through Foxconn in China, and China is its second-largest consumer market. The uncertainty that follows Trump's diplomacy-by-social-media tactic also has investors cautioning about overreacting to this or any development around trade and tariffs before any policy or proposal is finalized. ""Our view remains that tariffs will eventually not end up as bad as feared, but we will see increased uncertainty over the coming months,"" Jefferies analyst Mohit Kumar wrote in a note to investors Tuesday. ""Tariffs will further support the view of US over rest of the world from an investment perspective,"" Kumar wrote, suggesting these duties may offer an opportunity for investors. Capital Economics' Brown added that, ""Given the likelihood that these types of threats will be commonplace for the next four years, there is a risk of overinterpreting them."" Still, the speed with which Trump appears to be putting plans in place signals the incoming president is looking to ""move much more quickly with tariffs than during his first term.""

The Dow increased 0.9% to close at a new record. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.3%, despite Nvidia (NVDA) sliding over 4%. The Russell 2000 (^RUT), up 1.6%, also closed a whisker off a record high. It did notch an intraday high. Stocks kicked off a holiday-shortened week with more of the upbeat mood that lifted the gauges to weekly wins. Markets will shut on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday and close early on Friday. Trump tapped Bessent, viewed as the ""investor favorite"" pick for Treasury, late Friday evening after a surprisingly drawn-out process that saw candidates' stocks seem to rise and fall by the day. Bessent's nomination has seemed to at least temporarily calm nerves over the president-elect's inflationary agenda, with the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) dipping back under 4.3%. On the inflationary front, the Fed will get its preferred look at the picture heading into Trump's term with Wednesday's release of the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index. Economists expect a tick up in ""core"" PCE, which is closely watched by the central bank. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) was in search of a milestone $100,000-per-coin level amid a near-50% surge over the past month. It was back down below $95,000 on Monday, however.

Meanwhile small cap stocks also rallied with the Russell 2000 (^RUT) gaining as much as 2% during the session to hit record intraday highs. The index closed just shy of its all-time high record. The markets rose on Monday following President-elect Donald Trump's choice of Scott Bessent for Treasury secretary. Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Kamlani reports: Allurion (ALUR) launched a new program to provide patients access to compounded weight-loss drugs Monday after months of pitching its own weight-loss solution — an ingestible balloon — as an alternative for patients who may not want to use the popular injectable GLP-1 drugs. Allurion CEO Shantanu Gaur told Yahoo Finance that, like others, the company continues to see a spillover effect from the unprecedented interest in GLP-1 drugs like Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Wegovy and Eli Lilly's (LLY) Zepbound. It's why the company is now offering copycat products at a fraction of the cost. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Pras Subramanian reports: Tesla stock (TSLA) is down Monday following a strong recent run-up as one Wall Street bank says “animal spirits” have pushed the stock beyond any “fundamental change” at the company. Joseph Spak at UBS noted that Tesla stock has surged around 40% since the election, adding over $350 million to its market cap. While some of President-elect Donald Trump's policy proposals could favor Tesla, there are some policy negatives as well that would hurt fundamentals more than where the theoretical upside has taken the stock. “The rise in Tesla stock is mostly driven by animal spirits/momentum (which has happened multiple times in TSLA’s history),” Spak wrote.

The cryptocurrency has been on a steady climb since the Donald Trump's presidential victory earlier this month. On Friday the token inched above $99,600. Year-to-date bitcoin is up about 120%. Cruise line stocks have had an impressive run this year, and there’s still more room for growth, according to Bank of America. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd. (NCLH) and Carnival Corporation (CCL) have climbed more than 30% while Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) is up over 80% year-to-date. Bank of America raised Norwegian's price target to $29 from $26 and kept a Neutral rating. For Carnival, the firm raised the price target to $28 from $24 and kept a Buy rating, while for Royal Caribbean, analysts raised the price target to $240 from $210 and kept a Neutral rating. “The travel industry is back,” Bank of America analyst Andrew Didora told Yahoo Finance. “It just seems like the core demographic here for cruise [lines], which is typically a bit higher income, they continue to be in a good spot from a discretionary spending perspective.” Cruise-line operators have seen a resurgence in demand as interest rebounded from the pandemic-era, when the restrictions kept fleets docked. Data from Bank of America shows that monthly cruise spending increased 8% in October on a yearly basis. Nvidia (NVDA) shares dropped to session lows, sinking more than 3% on Monday. The AI chip heavyweight was the worst performer among the 'Magnificent 7' stocks. Tesla (TSLA) shares fell more than 1% while Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN) rose more than 1%. Nvidia's slide weighed on the Nasdaq, which briefly turned negative by 12:20 p.m. ET. Netflix (NFLX) shares also slid 3%, keeping a lid on the tech-heavy index. The Russell 2000 (^RUT) rose more than 2% on Monday to hit its highest level since November 2021. The small cap index has rallied in recent months as the Fed began its interest rate cutting cycle, fueling expectations of less expensive financing. The Russell 2000 is up more than 20% year-to-date, with much of those gains occurring since early August. Two more Wall Street strategists are projecting the bull market in US stocks will roll on in 2025. On Monday, equity strategy teams at Barclays and RBC Capital Markets both issued a year-end target price of 6,600 for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) in 2025. The targets suggest a roughly 10.5% gain in the benchmark index over the next twelve months, about in line with the long-term historical average annual return over the past century. ""The story the data tells us is that another year of solid economic and earnings growth, some political tailwinds, and some additional relief on inflation (which should keep the S&P 500’s P/E elevated) can keep stocks moving higher in the year ahead,"" RBC Capital Markets head of US equity strategy Lori Calvasina wrote in a note to clients on Monday. Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, wrote that with ""inflation continuing to normalize, resilient macro, and Big Tech maintaining EPS growth leadership,"" the S&P 500 should continue its march higher.

MicroStrategy stock recovered from a loss of more than 7% in early trading. In a filing with the SEC, MicroStrategy said it spent $5.4 billion to acquire these bitcoin between Nov. 18-24, buying the bitcoin at an average price of $97,862. The company said it used proceeds from convertible notes and share sales to fund the purchase. The application software company, which has become a bitcoin proxy, has been buying tokens since 2020. In recent weeks, it has intensified its purchases as bitcoin has rallied to highs above $99,000 following Donald Trump's presidential win earlier this month. As of Sunday, MicroStrategy held a total of approximately 386,700 bitcoins, acquired for an aggregate purchase price of about $21.9 billion and an average purchase price of approximately $56,761 per bitcoin. Oil dropped to session lows on a report that a ceasefire between Israel and Lebanon-based Hezbollah may have been reached. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) sank more than 2% to hover below $70 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, traded below $74 per barrel. Axios reported on Monday that Israel and Lebanon have agreed to terms of a ceasefire, citing a senior US official. Earlier, the Israeli ambassador to Washington said in a radio interview on Monday that deal points still need to be finalized but an agreement ""can happen within days.” Nvidia (NVDA) shares dropped as much as 3% in early trading as the AI chip heavyweight failed to participate in the rest of the market gains. Nvidia shares extended their decline from Friday's session, despite the company beating on quarterly results announced last week. The AI chipmaker has been a leader in the overall markets this year, accounting for roughly 20% of the S&P 500's performance. US stocks rose on Monday as investors await the Fed's preferred measure of inflation this week and after President-elect Donald Trump announced his pick for Treasury secretary, Scott Bessent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the advance, up roughly 0.7%. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.5%, while those the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up almost 0.6%.

The average 30-year mortgage rate dropped slightly to 6.81% in the week, from 6.84% a week earlier. Interest rates have been hovering in the 6.8% area for four weeks straight. The 15-year mortgage rate rose to 6.1%, compared with 6.02% a week prior. “Rates have been relatively flat over the last few weeks as the market waits for more clarity on specific economic policies,” Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist, said in a statement. Ten-year Treasury yields, which closely track mortgage rates, moved sharply lower earlier this week after Trump selected hedge fund manager Scott Bessent to lead the Treasury Department. Bessent, who is well-connected on Wall Street and has been critical of the federal deficit, is seen as a potentially moderating force against some of Trump’s economic policy ideas. But yields have been volatile. They rose on Tuesday after Trump pledged to enact tariffs on goods imported from Mexico, Canada, and China on his first day in office, before falling back to pre-election levels on Wednesday morning. Policies like tariffs and tax cuts are widely seen as inflationary and would require interest rates to stay higher for longer to avoid overheating the economy.

On Monday, Trump posted on Truth Social that his administration plans to impose an additional 10% tariff on imports from China and a 25% tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada on Jan. 20, his first day in office. But American shoppers are likely to suffer higher prices as a result. ""I absolutely can see a world where there's more consumer impact because the cost of those tariffs ends up flowing through to the consumer,"" Best Buy CEO Corie Barry told reporters on a media call. She noted that vendors have ""very, very small margins in this industry, which means the vast majority of that tariff will probably be passed on to the consumer as a price increase."" Roughly 60% of Best Buy's products come from China, and Mexico is its second-largest supplier, as many companies have moved production of larger items to the country in the last five years. Items produced there include appliances, desktop computers, and large TVs. The business doesn't import anything from Canada. Read more: How do tariffs work, and who really pays them? Other electronics that could be affected include tablets, phones, and some TVs. The news comes as Best Buy is struggling to woo shoppers. On Tuesday, the retailer posted negative same-store sales growth for the 12th consecutive quarter. Best Buy did not specify what sort of price increase would go into effect. Potential mitigation tactics the company and its vendors are looking into include importing products ahead of tariffs going into effect, making decisions around which products it offers, changing supply sources, and seeking to diversify to other countries that might offer viable alternatives. SharkNinja (SN), which sells its products at Best Buy, said the company has been diversifying its supply chain for the last five years. ""The majority of that product is able to be made today outside of China,"" SharkNinja CEO Mark Barrocas told Yahoo Finance at Goldman Sachs' Global Retailing conference in September. ""We intend to have all of our US production made outside of China by the end of 2025."" Best Buy stock is under pressure, falling more than 7% on Tuesday. Year to date, shares are up nearly 17%, compared to a 27% gain for the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Tariffs are a headwind for all general merchandise retailers that sell categories like apparel, furnishings, and electronics. During Trump's first term, companies dealt with Chinese tariffs by eating the costs or passing them on, Scott Lincicome of Stiefel Trade Policy Center told Yahoo Finance. Goldman Sachs managing director Kate McShane told Yahoo Finance that if Trump's tariffs from 2018 to 2019 were an indication, companies are likely to raise prices if more tariffs are added. ""If there were to be tariffs, I think it would be inflationary for most retailers. In the past, what we've seen from tariffs is that prices go up,"" she said earlier this year. Walmart (WMT) CFO John David Rainey told Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief earlier this month that the company is ""very accustomed"" to ""living in a tariff environment"" over the past seven years. He added, ""We're always going to look to work with our suppliers or use our own private brand assortment to try to bring down prices for customers ... we'll have to navigate that environment.

Subscribe to the Bloomberg Daybreak podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen.​​​​​​ Shortly after futures settled, President Joe Biden said Israel and the Lebanese militant group had reached a deal after weeks of US-mediated talks. Futures had declined during the regular session on reports that an agreement was imminent and on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s statement that he was bringing the pact to a vote in Israel’s security cabinet Tuesday night. The deal may reduce Middle East supply risks, which have supported oil prices even amid widespread expectations of an oversupply of crude next year. Prices may slide at least $3 a barrel if the cease-fire materializes, said Robert Yawger, director of the energy futures division at Mizuho Securities USA. A truce “would imply that Iran gave the green light for Hezbollah to accept the cease-fire, which would probably make it less likely Israel will attack Iran’s nuclear facilities with the backing of the Trump Administration,” Yawger said. Buying activity from algorithmic-driven investors known as commodity trading advisers — or CTAs — prevented deeper declines, said Daniel Ghali, a commodity strategist at TD Securities. “Crude prices have displayed quite a bit of resiliency” against the news of a cease-fire, Ghali said. “We have just underwent a series of days in which CTAs have been contributing to the upside in crude prices. And in fact, we are seeing signs of buying exhaustion from this cohort that could fairly quickly morph into selling activity.” Traders are also assessing President-elect Donald Trump’s threat of new tariffs on key trading partners. Trump’s announcement of the potential levies on Canada, Mexico and China initially sparked a rally in the dollar that weighed on commodities priced in the currency. A report that 25% tariffs on Canadian and Mexican imports may include crude triggered losses for Toronto oil equities. Limiting the declines, some OPEC+ members have expressed doubt that they can implement a 180,000 barrel-a-day increase scheduled for January, and they see a need to postpone further hikes planned for the following months. The group is meeting on Dec. 1 to decide on the plans.

Oil futures rose as much as 1.9% in London, briefly trading above $74 a barrel. On Tuesday, Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman met with Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak and Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia Al-Sudani in Baghdad, where they discussed oil market stability, according to a statement from the Iraqi prime minister’s office. The whole of OPEC+ is due to meet online on Dec. 1. Eight OPEC+ nations are supposed to revive 2.2 million barrels a day in monthly installments from January, a sequence postponed from October as oil prices struggled. The group has been withholding output since late 2022 in a bid to shore up prices. Global oil markets are set to tip into a renewed glut next year even if OPEC+ cancels the supply hikes entirely, the International Energy Agency forecasts. Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. warn that prices are already set for a slump from above $70 a barrel toward $60 — and lower if the group opens the taps. Traders widely expect that the increase will be delayed, potentially until the second quarter, according to a Bloomberg survey last week. RBC Capital Markets LLC said in a note that the move could be postponed until late in the second quarter. After the meeting in Baghdad, Iraq once again stressed its “seriousness and determination to fully comply with the agreement,” according to a statement from the Saudi Press Agency.

Spending in 2024 came in at 7.5% higher than the approved budget for the year, while revenues were 4.9% ahead of the estimates from a year earlier. The government is “looking to use all the fiscal space to support the diversification program,” said Monica Malik, chief economist at Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC. “Overall spending is still high, despite the modest pull back.” Saudi Arabia has taken on massive investment and spending commitments to fund Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s Vision 2030 agenda to diversify the economy away from oil. The country has started to scale back some projects, in part because oil prices remain far below what’s needed to balance the budget. The kingdom’s finances have the resilience to withstand a decline in the level of crude, Finance Minister Mohammed Al-Jadaan told reporters. “The Saudi economy has reached a stage where oil market volatility doesn’t impact it as much as it used to,” he said. The difference now, he said, is that spending forecasts are helped by revenues from oil. Cuts to the budget of developments such as Neom, a planned new megacity on the Red Sea coast, come under the auspices of the Public Investment Fund rather than the government, according to Al-Jaadan. “There is not a single project under Vision 2030 that doesn’t have the right funding,” he said. Oil Lag Even so, Saudi Arabia, one of the world’s largest oil exporters, relies heavily on crude prices to sustain economic momentum. The kingdom needs Brent at over $98 a barrel to reach equilibrium in its finances, according to the International Monetary Fund’s latest forecasts. Bloomberg Economics puts the so-called breakeven at $106, once domestic spending by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund is taken into account. Brent crude has slumped almost 15% since the end of June, and traded at about $73 a barrel on Tuesday. Economic growth this year is expected to be 0.8%, rising to 4.6% in 2025, according to the budget. Saudi Arabia cut its growth forecasts for the next few years and projected deeper budget deficits than previously estimated in preliminary forecasts for revenue and spending published last month. Still, growth of about 4% over the next few years would still outpace most other major economies. (Updates with economist comment in third paragraph.)

The tech company, Evolv, revealed in a public filing that it “received a voluntary document request from the U.S. Attorney’s Office of the Southern District of New York” on Nov. 1. It was unclear what the request was seeking. The U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan declined to comment on the request, which was first reported by the Daily News. In an emailed statement, a spokesperson for Evolv said the company was “pleased to cooperate with all government agencies and regulators who request information from our company.” The Massachusetts-based tech company, whose scanners have also been used at sports stadiums and schools, has faced allegations of misconduct. Last month, Evolv’s board of directors fired its chief executive following an internal investigation that found certain sales had been “subject to extra-contractual terms and conditions.” On Tuesday, the company announced it had resolved a previous probe launched by the Federal Trade Commission last year over allegations of deceptive marketing practices. The company is also under separate investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Despite the legal and regulatory scrutiny, New York City Mayor Eric Adams announced a pilot program this summer to bring a handful of scanners to the city's subways to deter gun violence. The initiative drew immediate criticism from civil liberties groups who said the searches were unconstitutional, along with questions about its efficacy. In October, the city revealed the scanners did not detect any passengers with firearms — but falsely alerted more than 100 times.

The forecast far surpasses those of peers at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley, who recently boosted their views and expect the benchmark to reach 6,500 by the end of 2025. The S&P 500 has surged more than 25% this year, on track for a second year of returns above 20% — a run that’s occurred just four times in the past 100 years. A resilient economy, slowing inflation and expectations of Federal Reserve easing propelled the benchmark to a record, driven by tech mega caps. Chadha has been bullish on the US stock market all year, raising his target for the index several times. “We see steady robust momentum continuing into 2025, with earnings-per-share growth in the low double digits,” Chadha and his team wrote in a note on Monday. S&P 500 EPS is on track to rise 11% in 2024 to $253, in line with typical growth outside recessions, Chadha said. That would likely increase to $282 in 2025. But should global growth pick up to the upper end of its historical range, earnings growth could climb 17%, taking S&P EPS as high as $295, he added. The two-year boom for US stocks has created a major valuation gap with the rest of the world, with the S&P 500 now trading around 24 times its forward earnings. That’s a post-pandemic high, and closing in on the record last seen during the tech bubble. Yet high valuations are justified band could expand further, according to Chadha, who cited above-trend earnings growth and payout ratios over the past 10 years. Rising buybacks and equity flows have also been supportive. While Donald Trump is likely to implement policies with both positive and negative implications for growth, the sequencing will be key. It’s likely to be similar to the last Trump administration, when tax cuts and deregulation came first, followed by tariffs, the strategist said, adding economic growth will likely remain the priority. “We see various aspects of the cycle still to come,” Chadha wrote, citing factors including a move from de-stocking to re-stocking, a pickup in capital expenditure outside of the technology sector, a manufacturing recovery, higher consumer and corporate confidence and a rebound in capital markets and M&A activity.

He also outlined ""an additional 10% tariff, above any additional tariffs"" on imports from China, raising the risk of trade wars. Automakers such as Ford and General Motors -that have highly integrated supply chains across Mexico, the U.S. and Canada - lost 2.1% and 7.2%, respectively.

Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Italy’s Motor City, Car-Free Options Are Growing In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field In meetings in London, Deputy Governor Cevdet Akcay said he expects improving inflation and financial stability metrics will increasingly enable Turkey’s currency regime to become less interventionist, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity so as to discuss private conversations. Akcay explained that the country had pursued a so-called dirty float of the lira due to some market deficiencies, the people said. Such a system typically involves occasional central bank interventions aimed at adjusting the direction the currency or the pace of its movements. The central bank declined to comment. The bank left its benchmark interest rate unchanged for an eighth month last week, while implying a cut could soon be justified due to slowing inflation. Akcay said that the policy easing does not need to be uninterrupted, noting that while the pace may vary, the overall stance will remain very tight, people said. Akcay added that the lira’s current valuation poses no concerns, while cautioning that real depreciation of the currency could worsen inflation expectations, people said. Turkey’s economic administration has been pursuing a policy of real appreciation of the lira as part of its inflation-fighting strategy, meaning effectively keeping the currency’s monthly losses below the trailing monthly inflation. The Turkish lira’s performance this year has solidified its status as a top choice for carry traders, thanks to a benchmark interest rate of 50%, one of the highest among emerging-market currencies. Carry trade is an investment strategy where an investor borrows money in a currency with a low interest rate and invests in another currency that offers a higher rate. Despite a nominal 15% decline against the U.S. dollar in 2024, the lira has gained in real terms, drawing billions in carry trade inflows, according to Bloomberg Intelligence calculations. This flow has helped the central bank rebuild foreign exchange reserves, reducing its reliance on veiled interventions through state banks to stabilize the currency. Under Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek, Turkey has prioritized restoring investor confidence after years of unorthodox policies that pushed foreign funds out of the market. The currency’s relative stability has become a cornerstone of economy policies, with the central bank emphasizing its role in keeping inflation expectations in check. Governor Fatih Karahan previously described the lira’s real appreciation as a “direct consequence” of tight monetary policy, which has made Turkish assets more attractive to global investors.

October durable goods orders rose a smaller than expected 0.2%, other data showed, while applications for unemployment benefits at 213,000 were a bit lower than last week's upwardly revised 215,000 jobless claims. Dollar/yen fell to its lowest in about five weeks, standing 1.18% lower at 151.3. The weakening dollar lifted the euro 0.8% to $1.0568.

Trump's vows on Monday of big tariffs on Canada, Mexico and China, the United States' three largest trading partners, knocked their currencies lower and have left investors jittery. Some analysts argued that inflation risks could prevent Trump from ushering in more disruptive measures. ""We believe that Trump realizes that his win was almost entirely due to 3i's -- inflation, inequalities and immigration -- with prices being key,"" said Viktor Shvets, global head of desk strategy at Macquarie Capital. ""Unless there is an improvement, the electorate's revenge could be severe, and there is not much time, as within 12 months, mid-terms will dominate,"" he added. Shvets noted that Trump has picked Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary, who is expected to keep a leash on U.S. deficits and to use tariffs as a negotiating tool. ""The recent sharp dollar appreciation largely decreases the asset values in dollars outside U.S. and hence increases the rebalancing need to sell the dollar at the month-end,"" said Sheryl Dong, forex strategist at Barclays. The outperforming yen has benefited from bets for a December rate hike in Japan, and position adjustments. The dollar's selloff accelerated after the pair fell below the 200-day moving average at 151.998. Analysts flagged some relief as the country is not in the firing line of Trump's possible tariffs.

Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, the boss of the foundation, spoke with Fortune in London about how his philanthropic organization is using the success of Novo Nordisk to spearhead social and scientific causes while batting away fears that its influence over the Danish economy is a bad thing. Novo Nordisk has experienced a meteoric rise on the back of surging demand for its GLP-1 drugs Ozempic, Wegovy, and Semaglutide, which have been shown to fight obesity. At a valuation of $373 billion, the pharmaceutical company is now Europe’s largest by market capitalization and was briefly worth more than the entire Danish economy. The Novo Nordisk Foundation has become a major philanthropic force as a result, with Novo Holdings’ €149 billion ($156 billion) assets under management dwarfing the $75.2 billion endowment of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Cautious analysts have flagged the “Nokia risk” as a potential danger from the Danish economy becoming too reliant on a single company, in this case Novo Nordisk. Finland’s economy built a reliance on Nokia at the turn of the century, with the company contributing 25% of Finland’s GDP growth between 1998 and 2007. However, Nokia’s business model collapsed with the proliferation of smartphones, leaving Finland’s economy in a years-long economic mire. There are parallels between Nokia and Novo Nordisk in their relation to their respective economies, at least in their rise. Denmark’s economy would have shrunk by 0.1% last year rather than growing by 1.8% without its pharmaceuticals sector. Danske Bank expects Novo Nordisk to play a significant part in Denmark’s economy, which it forecast in March to grow by an estimated 2.4% this year. The company is also a huge tax payer, sending $2.3 billion in income taxes to the Danish government in 2023. It begs the question whether a shock or a gradual increase in competition could see Denmark go the same way as Finland. However, the Novo Nordisk Foundation’s Thomsen was dismissive of these comparisons. “You cannot compare Novo and Nokia from a dynamic perspective,” Thomsen told Fortune. “The Nokia risk is fundamentally different.” “Because the Nokia, the one we all had, was an old-fashioned but wonderful, robust telephone. Then suddenly comes the first iPhone that's totally changing the technology. Now, you could email, you could do things you never could before with smartphones. And that was a technology disruptor.” Detractors, however, say Novo Nordisk faces a different risk, namely the expiry of its valuable patent on its weight loss-aiding drugs, with the core patent for Ozempic expiring in 2026. After this point competitors will be able to access these patents to make their own GLP-1s, threatening the company’s chokehold on the industry. “You will have Chinese, Russian, Brazilian, Indian companies producing stuff like Semaglutide sooner rather than later, but they will [only] be able to fulfill some of the local demands, probably nationally speaking,” Thomsen admitted. However, he said that if you look at the history of the diabetes drug Insulin, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly have continued to operate a duopoly event in the wake of patent expirations. “The same is expectedly going to happen with GLP-1s,” said Thomsen. His main argument for this is scale. Thomsen said that currently, only around 9 million people are making use of Novo Nordisk’s and Eli Lilly’s GLP-1s against an estimated 1 billion people living with obesity across the globe. “So you can multiply it by effect to 10, 15, 20, 30, the amount of volumes of these molecules needed to take down the obesity burden, the diabetes burden. “So I think what will happen is there's going to be a massive scale-up, where the biggest contributor to that scale-up will be the existing companies, because they simply have the scale and the technology, while there will be a multitude of small regional players that will be making biosignals. And that's all fine and good, and prices will come down, but that's compensated by huge volumes.” This story was originally featured on Fortune.com","The CEO the Novo Nordisk Foundation (NNF), the philanthropic arm the Danish Ozempic-making pharmaceutical Denmark is in fundamentally different the risk” economic downturn in thanks to its overreliance on one Krogsgaard Thomsen, boss of the foundation, spoke with about how his philanthropic organization using of Nordisk to spearhead social and batting that its influence the economy is bad thing.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-policymakers-open-lowering-overnight-213818807.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 1:38 PM","SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Some Federal Reserve policymakers believe it may soon be time to lower the rate on funds that banks and money market funds park at the Fed, minutes from the Fed's most recent meeting indicated, so that it once again matches the bottom of the range of the policy rate. The so-called overnight reverse repurchase agreement rate, one of two technical lending rates the Fed uses to ensure the federal funds rate stays within its monetary policy target range, is currently set at 4.55%, while the policy rate range is 4.5% to 4.75%. The overnight reverse repurchase agreement rate has ridden 5 basis points above the bottom of the Fed's policy rate range since 2021, when the Fed adjusted it to firm up the ""floor"" of the policy rate range. The goal was to retain firm control of the federal funds rate - what banks charge each other for overnight lending - even as the Fed expanded its balance sheet. The Fed is now two years into the process of trimming its balance sheet, and the reverse repo facility has fallen from a peak of $2.6 trillion at the end of 2022 to just under $150 billion this week. Eliminating the 5 basis-point spread between the overnight reverse repurchase agreement rate and the bottom of the monetary policy rate would make the reverse repo facility -- widely viewed as a proxy for excessive liquidity -- marginally less appealing.

Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Italy’s Motor City, Car-Free Options Are Growing In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field NYC's Underground Steam System May Be Key to a Greener Future NYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge The Canadian province, which holds the world’s third-largest crude reserves in its oil sands, plans to introduce a motion to “stop a federal cap from infringing on the province’s distinct jurisdiction,” Alberta’s government said. Trudeau’s government earlier this month announced a plan to implement a cap-and-trade system to require its oil and gas industry to cut emissions as much as 35% below 2019 levels. The proposal would go into force in six years. Alberta has vowed to challenge the proposal, arguing it will result in a production cut of at least 1 million barrels a day of oil and gas in the province, while effectively prohibiting any production growth. “Albertans are relying on us to stand firm on this and we will not let them down,” Premier Danielle Smith said in a press conference from Edmonton. The Alberta Sovereignty Within a United Canada Act, passed early in Smith’s term in office, orders provincial agencies to not enforce or aid in enforcing federal rules deemed unconstitutional or “causing harm to Albertans.” Should a cap become law, Alberta will launch an immediate constitutional challenge, the government said. Alberta’s motion would prohibit entry by individuals, including federal officials, onto any oil and gas facility unless they are licensed by Alberta. It also would declare information related to greenhouse gas emissions from oil and gas sites as “proprietary information exclusively owned by the Government of Alberta.” Companies would be required to report their emissions directly to the provincial government, which would disclose the data at its own discretion. The province plans to take an active role in strategically selling oil and gas collected as royalties in lieu of cash, Smith said, suggesting the heavy crude could be sold to fill the US Strategic Petroleum Reserves or supply the US Defense Department or be sold to buyers overseas who face challenges in securing supplies from companies.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-minutes-may-show-start-110851420.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 3:08 AM","By Howard Schneider WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Reserve officials say they are likely to keep reducing interest rates for now, and investors still expect them to do so at the U.S. central bank's Dec. 17-18 meeting. But how far they will go beyond that remains a wide-open question, with the minutes of the Fed's meeting earlier this month expected to show the start of a debate that will shape the financial landscape faced by the incoming Trump administration. The minutes of that session are due to be released at 2 p.m. EST (1900 GMT) on Tuesday and will provide a detailed account of the Nov. 6-7 session where officials grappled with data showing stronger-than-expected economic growth and higher-than-expected inflation. While job growth slipped in October, the sense among policymakers was that the U.S. economy was continuing to beat expectations. ""It's actually remarkable how well the U.S. economy has been performing, with strong growth, a strong labor market, inflation coming down,"" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in a Nov. 7 press conference after the central bank announced it was cutting its benchmark policy rate by a quarter of a percentage point to the 4.50%-4.75% range. ""We're on a path to a more neutral stance ... We're just going to have to see where the data lead us ... I'm not ruling (December) out or in,"" Powell said of the Fed's plans to make monetary policy less restrictive and eventually be neither stimulating nor restraining economic activity. Public commentary since the meeting, which often reflects the positions staked out during the two days of deliberations, has shown a broad divide among Fed officials who feel monetary policy may already be close to the neutral level and, as a result, near a possible stopping point for rate cuts, and those expecting a likely more extended cutting cycle. Powell just a week after the meeting said the economy was ""not sending any signals that we need to be in a hurry to lower rates,"" and that the central bank could decide on further reductions in borrowing costs ""carefully."" His comments contributed to what has been a steady slip in market expectations for a rate cut next month, with a quarter-percentage-point reduction given just a 53% probability as of Monday afternoon. TRUMP EFFECT While officials like Fed Governor Lisa Cook have focused on what she sees as a steady easing of inflation still to come alongside possible improvements in productivity, others say they still see inflation risk as paramount. ""We have seen considerable progress in lowering inflation since early 2023, but progress seems to have stalled in recent months,"" Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said last week at an event in Florida, adding that the central bank ""may be closer to a neutral policy stance than we currently think."" If so, it may imply fewer Fed rate cuts overall, a possibility that has grown more distinct in the minds of many investors and economists since Republican former President Donald Trump won the Nov. 5 presidential election on a platform to cut taxes, restrict immigration, and raise import tariffs. The fallout from those policies, including possibly heightened inflation and wage pressures, could also lead to more caution about cutting rates too far and too fast. Investors now see the Fed's benchmark rate falling only to around 3.9% next year, and no further, stopping a full percentage point higher than policymakers foresaw in their last set of projections in September.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-minutes-offer-clues-far-100000632.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 2:00 AM","(Bloomberg) -- Several Federal Reserve officials have signaled they’re open to cutting interest rates at a more deliberate pace next year as they grapple with the uncertainties of a Republican takeover in Washington, a pickup in productivity and slower improvement on inflation. Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field NYC's Underground Steam System May Be Key to a Greener Future NYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge Minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee’s Nov. 6-7 meeting, set for release at 2 p.m. in Washington, could provide more clues on whether policymakers are rethinking how fast and how far to lower borrowing costs. Chair Jerome Powell, Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan and Governor Michelle Bowman are among those suggesting they’re in no rush, though none has ruled out a rate cut at the Fed’s next meeting in December. “They want to make sure they give themselves optionality, with growth being more resilient and inflation showing a bit more stickiness,” said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide. Fed officials lowered interest rates in November, but investors have pared bets for another reduction next month. Odds of a quarter-point cut in December are just above 50-50, down from about 80% before the November meeting. The minutes could shed light on three big issues emerging from the recent public remarks of policymakers: Higher End Point A number of Fed officials have said they are now aiming, over time, to bring the policy rate down to a level that neither restrains nor stimulates the economy. But many of them also appear to be reassessing what that so-called neutral rate is, based on the economy’s surprisingly strong performance over the past two years. “My estimate of the neutral policy rate is much higher than it was before the pandemic,” Bowman said Nov. 20. There’s a risk that if the Fed keeps cutting “the policy rate may attain or even fall below its neutral level before we achieve our price stability goal.” If borrowing costs were to fall below neutral, policymakers would face the unwelcome risk of overstimulating the economy and fanning price increases. “I see substantial signs that the neutral rate has increased in recent years, and some hints that it could be very close to where the fed funds rate is now.” — Lorie Logan, Nov. 13 A quarter-point cut next month would bring the federal funds rate down to a range of 4.25% to 4.5%. The full percentage point of easing since September would be the fastest pace of rate reductions outside a crisis since 2001. It would also leave borrowing costs just about 75 basis points above an investor-preferred proxy for the neutral rate. Fed officials are required to submit their own estimates of neutral, also known as the “longer-run” fed funds rate, each quarter. Those estimates have been steadily climbing, with the forecast median at 2.9% in September, up from 2.5% in December 2023. But policymakers were sharply divided in the latest projections: 12 officials estimated neutral in a range of 2.375% to 3%, while seven forecast 3.25% to 3.75%. Both the economy and markets seem to agree with the higher rate group. While most Fed officials maintain policy is still restrictive, overall demand remains healthy, and inflation is still not convincingly settled around the 2% goal. Productivity Surge A pickup in US labor productivity has been another surprise, following years of tepid growth. The key ingredient to raising living standards, an acceleration in output per hour is always welcomed by Fed officials. It’s a sign of labor becoming more efficient with the help of better technology. But it also raises questions for monetary policy. A more productive economy allows for faster growth without sparking inflation. More investment in capital, meanwhile, is typically needed to sustain that growth. “The economy is not sending any signals that we need to be in a hurry to lower rates.” — Jerome Powell, Nov. 14 Jason Thomas, head of global research and investment strategy at Carlyle Group Inc., said the productivity bump, combined with the potential of growth-fueling tax cuts from the incoming Trump administration, raises the risk the Fed may cut too much, too soon. “In terms of risk and reward, I can’t imagine them wanting to cut into that,” he said. “You have higher demand for capital and labor, and if you take rates too low you have an over-stimulation, which generates inflation.” Thomas expects one to two more additional rate cuts, possibly in March and June. 2% Inflation Fed officials believe they’re on their way to price stability, but are not there yet, and President-elect Donald Trump’s proposals introduce substantial uncertainty. Deregulation and tax cuts could boost growth and spur inflation. Tariffs and deportations could dampen consumption, investment and growth, while also raising prices. Nobody really knows how the mix of proposals will play out. Loretta Mester, the former Cleveland Fed President, said a takeaway from the post-pandemic inflation surge in 2021 is that policy needs to be ready to respond to a range of risks in times of high uncertainty, and that probably translates into a gradual pace of cuts. “What you want to do is make sure you keep policy well-positioned so that you can address whichever way the risks manifest themselves,” said Mester, now an adjunct full professor of finance at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. “With the strength in the economy, there is no reason to hurry.” --With assistance from Vince Golle.

The Fed lowered its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-percentage point earlier this month, to a range of 4.5%-4.75%, following a larger-than-usual, half-point reduction in September. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said earlier this month that the economy is not sending signals policymakers need to be in a hurry to lower rates. Fed officials will gather for their last policy meeting of the year on Dec. 17-18. The record of the November meeting showed some officials said the Fed could pause rate cuts and hold borrowing costs at a restrictive level if inflation remains elevated. Some noted reductions could be accelerated if the economy or labor market deteriorates. Policymakers also noted a lack of clarity about the so-called neutral rate, a level of policy that neither restricts nor stimulates economic growth, as a reason for caution. Many officials said that uncertainty “complicated the assessment of the degree of restrictiveness of monetary policy and, in their view, made it appropriate to reduce policy restraint gradually,” according to the minutes released Tuesday in Washington. Officials’ estimates for the neutral rate have steadily climbed over the past year, but just how close rates may be to such a stance remains unclear. The minutes also showed Fed officials are considering a “technical adjustment” to the rate offered for the overnight reverse repurchase facility — a secondary interest rate that influences borrowing costs in the economy. Labor Market Policymakers saw the downside risks to employment and growth as having “decreased somewhat.” Officials generally assessed there was “no sign of rapid deterioration” in the job market, the minutes showed. The employment snapshot for October was muddied by hurricanes and a major labor strike. But the broader picture suggests the labor market is gradually cooling though still on solid footing, with low levels of unemployment and limited layoffs. On inflation, officials said price growth has eased substantially from its peak but noted the core measure, which excludes food and energy, remains “somewhat elevated.” “Participants indicated that they remained confident that inflation was moving sustainably toward 2%, although a couple noted the possibility that the process could take longer than previously expected,” the minutes showed. Investors have pulled back on expectations that the Fed will again cut interest rates in December, following recent firm inflation readings and comments from Fed officials urging caution. Data due Wednesday is expected to show the Fed’s preferred gauges of inflation picked up in October from a year earlier, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists. The central bank’s November meeting came on the heels of the re-election of Donald Trump.

U.S. Treasury yields pared some declines in choppy trading after data showed U.S. consumer spending increased solidly in October, suggesting the economy kept a strong growth pace last month but that progress dampening inflation has stalled. Oil prices flitted between red and green after a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon while also anticipating Sunday's OPEC+ meeting, which may delay a planned increase in oil output. Equities lost some ground as investors read through the data, which showed that in the 12 months through October core inflation, which the U.S. central bank tracks for monetary policy, increased 2.8% after climbing 2.7% in September. ""This was no earth-shattering news for the markets. We all expected that inflation would pop up a little bit, but inflation is not getting out of hand.

Cardillo expects a pause in rate cuts after December on uncertainty about Trump's tariff threats. Trump said late on Monday that he would immediately put a 25% tariff on all products from Mexico and Canada when he takes office in January, and impose an additional 10% tariff on goods from China. The threat drew warnings of retaliation. The incoming president also chose trade lawyer Jamieson Greer as his new U.S. trade representative, a veteran of his first-term trade war against China. Alex Atanasiu, portfolio manager at Glenmede Investment Management, pointed to preparation for Trump's return to the White House as a factor behind Wednesday's trading since small cap and cyclical stocks were up ""at the expense of megacap tech.""

The current rate for the RRP is 4.55%, which sits about five basis points above the bottom of the Fed’s policy target range of 4.5% to 4.75%. Balances at the key Fed facility have dropped by about $2.4 trillion since their December 2022 peak, though the pace of declines has slowed in recent months. On Wall Street, the sum of cash parked on the RRP has long been considered a barometer of excess liquidity — a useful gauge for market participants as the central bank continues to unwind its balance sheet via a process known as quantitative tightening. To Gennadiy Goldberg, head of US interest rate strategy at TD Securities, the inclusion of this consideration in the central bank’s minutes shows that “the Fed could take this step if there is some pressure in money market rates at month-end or year-end.” “Given the recent decline in RRP balances, however, this change may not be imminent,” he said. Fifty-one counterparties parked $148.8 billion at the RRP on Tuesday, the lowest since Nov. 5. Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan said in a speech last month if balances in the facility don’t decline as repo rates rise closer to the interest rate on reserve balances, it may be appropriate to reduce the RRP rate. Officials last tinkered with the tools when it raised the rate on the RRP facility in June 2021 as a dollar glut in short-term funding markets outstripped supply of investable securities and weighed down front-end rates, despite the steadiness of the Fed’s key benchmark.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-consumer-spending-increases-solidly-151446393.html,"Wed, Nov 27, 2024, 9:27 AM","By Lucia Mutikani WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. consumer spending increased slightly more than expected in October, suggesting the economy retained much of its solid growth momentum early in the fourth quarter, but progress on lowering inflation appears to have stalled in recent months. The lack of success in bringing inflation back to the Federal Reserve's 2% target, together with the prospect of higher tariffs on imported goods from the incoming Trump administration, could narrow the scope for interest rate cuts from the U.S. central bank next year. The Fed is still expected to deliver a third rate cut in December, with other data on Wednesday showing more unemployed people were experiencing long bouts of joblessness in mid-November. ""December remains in play, but further rate cuts in 2025 are fading,"" said David Russell, global head of market strategy at TradeStation. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 0.4% last month after an upwardly revised 0.6% advance in September, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast consumer spending would gain 0.3% after a previously reported 0.5% increase in September. Adjusted for inflation, consumer spending edged up 0.1%. Spending was largely driven by strong demand for services, including healthcare, housing and utilities, financial services and insurance, dining out and hotel stays as well as transportation and recreation. Services spending rose 0.5%. Goods outlays were unchanged as an increase in purchases of motor vehicles and parts was offset by lower receipts at service stations because of cheaper gasoline. There were also declines in outlays of apparel, furniture and other long-lasting manufactured household equipment. Consumption is being largely underpinned by low layoffs, with additional help from strong household balance sheets thanks to a stock market rally and high home prices. Household savings also remain lofty. The saving rate increased to 4.4% from 4.1% in September. Income at the disposal of households rose 0.6%, boosted by a 0.5% gain in wages. After accounting for inflation and taxes, income at the disposal of household rose 0.4% after edging up 0.1% in September. Economists are anticipating a fairly decent holiday shopping season, though high prices are squeezing budgets. Data from Adobe showed consumers have in the first 24 days of November spent $77.4 billion online, up 9.6% on year-over-year basis. The Mastercard Economics Institute described this holiday shopping season as being characterized by ""the value-conscious consumer who feels stretched by economic pressures,"" and ""a confident consumer who feels more free to spend."" U.S. stocks traded lower. The dollar fell against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury yields fell. LOW LAYOFFS Though inflation is cooling, the trend has slowed. The personal consumption expenditures price index climbed 0.2% in October, matching September's unrevised gain. In the 12 months through October, the PCE price index increased 2.3% after advancing 2.1% in September. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index rose 0.3%, matching the increase in September. In the 12 months through October, core inflation increased 2.8% after climbing 2.7% in September. The central bank tracks the PCE price measures for monetary policy. There are concerns inflation could rise next year if President-elect Donald Trump pushes ahead with some of his campaign promises. Trump said on Monday he would impose a 25% tariff on all products from Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China, on his first day in office. Economists at Goldman Sachs estimated the tariffs, if implemented, would increase core PCE inflation by 0.9%. Growing signs of labor market slack could, however, outweigh concerns about higher inflation readings. A separate report from the Labor Department showed initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 2,000 to a seasonally adjusted 213,000 for the week ended Nov. 23, the lowest level since April. Economists had forecast 216,000 claims for the latest week. Claims have retreated from the nearly 1-1/2-year high seen in early October, which was the result of hurricanes and strikes at Boeing and another aerospace company. They are now at levels consistent with low layoffs and a rebound in employment in November. Despite the anticipated bounce back in payrolls, the unemployment rate is likely to be unchanged or even rise this month. The number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid, a proxy for hiring, increased 9,000 to a seasonally adjusted 1.907 million during the week ending Nov. 16, the highest level since November 2021, the claims report showed. The so-called continuing claims data covered the period during which the government surveyed households for November's unemployment rate. They increased between the October and November survey periods, indicating that many laid-off workers are finding it difficult to land new jobs. The jobless rate has held steady at 4.1% for two straight months. The employment report for November would be crucial for the U.S. central bank's rate decision next month. Financial markets expect a 25-basis-point rate cut at the Fed's Dec. 17-18 policy meeting, but some economists see it as a toss-up. Minutes of the Fed's Nov. 6-7 policy meeting published on Tuesday showed officials appeared divided over how much farther they may need to cut rates. The central bank reduced rates by 25 basis points earlier this month, lowering its benchmark overnight interest rate to the 4.50%-4.75% range. It initiated its policy easing cycle in September, which marked its first reduction in borrowing costs since 2020, after hiking rates by 525 basis points in 2022 and 2023 to quell inflation.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-tariffs-first-term-did-182403261.html,"Wed, Nov 27, 2024, 10:24 AM","WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump loved to use tariffs on foreign goods during his first presidency. But their impact was barely noticeable in the overall economy, even if their aftershocks were clear in specific industries. The data show they never fully delivered on his promised factory jobs. Nor did they provoke the avalanche of inflation that critics feared. This time, though, his tariff threats might be different. The president-elect is talking about going much bigger — on a potential scale that creates more uncertainty about whether he'll do what he says and what the consequences could be. “There's going to be a lot more tariffs, I mean, he's pretty clear,” said Michael Stumo, the CEO of Coalition for a Prosperous America, a group that has supported import taxes to help domestic manufacturing. The president-elect posted on social media Monday that on his first day in office he would impose 25% tariffs on all goods imported from Mexico and Canada until those countries satisfactorily stop illegal immigration and the flow of illegal drugs such as fentanyl into the United States. Those tariffs could essentially blow up the North American trade pact that Trump’s team negotiated during his initial term. Chinese imports would face additional tariffs of 10% until Beijing cracks down on the production of materials used in making fentanyl, Trump posted. Democrats and business groups warn of risks from Trump's tariff threats Business groups were quick to warn about rapidly escalating inflation, while Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said she would counter the move with tariffs on U.S. products. House Democrats put together legislation to strip a president’s ability to unilaterally apply tariffs this drastic, warning that they would likely lead to higher prices for autos, shoes, housing and groceries. Sheinbaum said Wednesday that her administration is already working up a list of possible retaliatory tariffs “if the situation comes to that.” “The economy department is preparing it,” Sheinbaum said. “If there are tariffs, Mexico would increase tariffs, it is a technical task about what would also benefit Mexico,” she said, suggesting her country would impose targeted import duties on U.S. goods in sensitive areas. House Democrats on Tuesday introduced a bill that would require congressional approval for a president to impose tariffs due to claims of a national emergency, a largely symbolic action given Republicans' coming control of both the House and Senate. ""This legislation would enable Congress to limit this sweeping emergency authority and put in place the necessary Congressional oversight before any president – Democrat or Republican – could indiscriminately raise costs on the American people through tariffs,” said Rep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash. But for Trump, tariffs are now a tested tool that seems less politically controversial even if the mandate he received in November's election largely involved restraining inflation. The tariffs he imposed on China in his first term were continued by President Joe Biden, a Democrat who even expanded tariffs and restrictions on the world's second largest economy. Biden administration officials looked at removing Trump's tariffs in order to bring down inflationary pressures, only to find they were unlikely to help significantly. Tariffs were “so new and unique that it freaked everybody out in 2017,” said Stumo, but they were ultimately somewhat modest. Trump's first term tariffs had a modest impact on economy Trump imposed tariffs on solar panels and washing machines at the start of 2018, moves that might have pushed up prices in those sectors even though they also overlapped with plans to open washing machine plants in Tennessee and South Carolina. His administration also levied tariffs on steel and aluminum, including against allies. He then increased tariffs on China, leading to a trade conflict and a limited 2020 agreement that failed to produce the promised Chinese purchases of U.S. goods. Still, the dispute changed relations with China as more U.S. companies looked for alternative suppliers in other countries. Economic research also found the United States may have sacrificed some of its “soft power” as the Chinese population began to watch fewer American movies. The Federal Reserve kept inflation roughly on target, but factory construction spending never jumped in a way that suggested a lasting gain in manufacturing jobs. Separate economic research found the tariff war with China did nothing economically for the communities hurt by offshoring, but it did help Trump and Republicans in those communities politically. When Trump first became president in 2017, the federal government collected $34.6 billion in customs, duties and fees. That sum more than doubled under Trump to $70.8 billion in 2019, according to Office of Management and Budget records. While that sum might seem meaningful, it was relatively small compared to the overall economy. America's gross domestic product is now $29.3 trillion, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The total tariffs collected in the United States would equal less than 0.3% of GDP. Trump wants much more far-reaching tariffs going forward The new tariffs being floated by Trump now are dramatically larger and there could be far more significant impacts. If Mexico, Canada, and China faced the additional tariffs proposed by Trump on all goods imported to the United States, that could be roughly equal to $266 billion in tax collections, a number that does not assume any disruptions in trade or retaliatory moves by other countries. The cost of those taxes would likely be borne by U.S. families, importers and domestic and foreign companies in the form of higher prices or lower profits. Former Biden administration officials said they worried that companies could piggyback on Trump's tariffs — if they're imposed — as a rationale to raise their prices, just as many companies after Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022 boosted food and energy costs and gave several major companies the space to raise prices, according to their own earnings calls with investors. But what Trump didn't really spell out is what might cause him to back down on tariffs and declare a victory. What he is creating instead with his tariff threats is a sense of uncertainty as companies and countries await the details to figure out what all of this could mean. “We know the key economic policy priorities of the incoming Trump administration, but we don’t know how or when they will be addressed,” said Greg Daco, chief U.S. economist at EY-Parthenon. __ AP writer Mark Stevenson contributed to this report from Mexico City.","WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump loved to use tariffs on foreign goods during his first presidency. their impact noticeable the overall economy, aftershocks clear in specific industries. data show they never fully delivered on factory jobs.

Gross domestic product increased at an unrevised 2.8% annualized rate, the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis said in its second estimate of third-quarter GDP. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast GDP would be unrevised. Slight downward revisions to consumer spending, government outlays and exports, were offset by upgrades to private inventory accumulation, business investment as well as state and local government spending. The economy grew at a 3.0% pace in the April-June quarter. It is expanding at a pace that is well above what Federal Reserve officials regard as the non-inflationary growth rate of around 1.8%. Consumer spending, which accounts for more than two-thirds of economic activity, grew at a still-brisk 3.5% pace. That was revised down from the previously estimated 3.7% rate. A measure of domestic demand that excludes government spending, trade and inventories increased at an unrevised 3.2% pace. Domestic demand increased at 2.7% pace in the second quarter. National after-tax profits without inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments increased $0.2 billion, or were unchanged in percentage terms last quarter. They increased 9.6% from the same quarter one year ago. Profits of domestic financial firms decreased $2.6 billion, while those of non financial institutions increased $30.8 billion. Profits from the rest of the world fell $38.3 billion. When measured from the income side, the economy grew at a 2.2% rate last quarter. Gross domestic income (GDI) increased at a downwardly revised 2.0% pace in the second quarter. GDI was previously estimated to have increased at a 3.4% pace in the April-June quarter. In principle, GDP and GDI should be equal, but in practice they differ as they are estimated using different and largely independent source data.

That compares with the 4.2% median estimate of 30 economists surveyed by Bloomberg and 4% forecast by the central bank. “We think there’s a large negative output gap that has been and will continue to be disinflationary,” said Matheny. “So, our inflation forecasts for next year, but also in the medium term, are way below everybody else’s.” Goldman’s upbeat outlook on price pressures, which undershoots the midpoint of the central bank’s 3% to 6% target range, where it prefers to anchor inflation expectations, also means that it’s more optimistic on interest rates. Matheny foresees an additional 125 basis points in rate cuts in the current easing cycle that started in September. The median of 17 economists in a Bloomberg survey sees a further 75 basis points of easing and the central bank’s staff model suggests another 50 basis points of cuts. The central bank’s monetary policy committee delivered its second quarter-point rate cut of the easing cycle last week, lowering the benchmark rate to 7.75%.

There was uncertainty about the direction of the economy, Fed officials noted, according to the minutes of the Nov. 6-7 meeting, uncertainty about just how much the current level of interest rates was doing to restrict the economy - a key issue in deciding how much further rates should fall - and a developing case to step carefully. ""Many participants observed that uncertainties concerning the level of the neutral rate of interest complicated the assessment of the degree of restrictiveness of monetary policy and, in their view, made it appropriate to reduce policy restraint gradually,"" said the minutes, which were released on Tuesday. The neutral interest rate is the level at which economic activity is neither stimulated nor restrained. ""Participants noted that monetary policy decisions were not on a pre-set course and were conditional on the evolution of the economy and the implications for the economic outlook ... They stressed that it would be important for the (Federal Open Market) Committee to make this clear as it adjusted its policy stance,"" the minutes stated, referring to the central bank's policy-setting committee. The Fed cut its benchmark policy rate by a quarter of a percentage point to the 4.50%-4.75% range at the meeting three weeks ago, a session that followed Republican candidate Donald Trump's victory in the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election. Though the implication of the election outcome was not mentioned in the minutes, ""many"" participants noted the complications of making policy at a time when economic data was volatile due to storms, strikes and other factors, and geopolitical tensions were high. Fed officials generally agree that inflation is all but controlled, and the risk of a sharp rise in unemployment has diminished. Still ""some participants noted that the Committee could pause its easing of the policy rate and hold it at a restrictive level"" if inflation remained too high, and some said rate cuts could be accelerated ""if the labor market turned down or economic activity faltered."" After the release of the minutes, financial markets added slightly to bets on a rate cut at the Fed's Dec. 17-18 meeting, and kept intact prior bets on a slower pace of reductions next year, with just one cut priced in by the middle of the year. STRONG ECONOMY ""We continue to think that the FOMC will reduce the funds rate by a further 25 bp (basis points) in December,"" wrote Samuel Tombs, chief U.S. economist for Pantheon Macroeconomics, but then scale back next year to navigate a potentially complicated set of policy developments once Trump takes office. The president-elect this week, for example, said he planned on his first day in office to impose import tariffs of 25% on Mexico and Canada alongside demands for tougher border control. ""Our base case is that the Fed will have to ease cautiously, most likely at alternate meetings next year, trading off labor market and inflation risks,"" Tombs wrote. ""Huge uncertainty over the scale, timing and likelihood of President Trump's economic proposals, however, creates considerable risk to both sides of our funds rate forecast."" The Fed's November meeting also followed a run of stronger-than-expected economic data - ""remarkable"" is how Fed Chair Jerome Powell referred to it - that stoked concern monetary policy may not be restricting the economy as much as thought. Officials since that session have said ongoing economic strength meant the central bank's benchmark policy rate might already be close to the ""neutral"" level, an argument for fewer rate cuts approved at a slower pace in order to avoid easing policy too much and possibly rekindling inflation. Others argue the economy was likely to slow and the job market continue to weaken, which would be a reason to continue easing financial conditions to encourage spending and investment.

In a TV appearance Monday on Fox Business, he said it was “pretty clear” that the Fed is “on a path, and that path is going to lead to lower rates, closer to what you might call neutral.” His comments to The Overshoot echoed recent remarks from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who told reporters after the central bank announced a rate cut on Nov. 7 that “as we approach levels that are plausibly neutral or close to neutral, it may turn out to be appropriate to slow the pace at which we’re dialing back restriction.” In September, policymakers put the neutral rate at 2.9%, according to their median estimate, far below the current rate level of 4.5% to 4.75%.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brazil-inflation-surges-president-lula-142741994.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 6:27 AM","(Bloomberg) -- Brazil’s inflation picked up much more than expected in early November, adding urgency to government plans to cut swelling public spending that is pushing cost-of-living increases above target. Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field NYC's Underground Steam System May Be Key to a Greener Future NYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge Official data released Tuesday showed consumer prices rose 4.77% from a year earlier, above all forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists that had a 4.64% median estimate. On the month, they increased 0.62%. Price pressures are building in Latin America’s largest economy, stoked by a historic drought and investor anxiety over growing government spending. The central bank has been hiking interest rates since September to pull the annual inflation rate back down to its 3% goal — and warned it will continue to do so if the outlook does not improve. So far, a hot job market and strong consumer demand have dulled the effects of double-digit borrowing costs. At the same time, food and energy have been further impacted by Brazil’s worst-ever drought that’s withered crops and caused regulators to increase utility prices. Food and beverage prices jumped 1.34% on the month, representing the biggest driver of inflation in the first half of November. Nearly all of the groups of good services tracked by the statistics agency became more expensive in the period, with only education costs cooling 0.01%. The price of airfare, a perennial source of frustration for Brazilians, shot up nearly 23% as the holiday travel season approaches. ‘Continuous Deterioration’ Economists were divided over the implications of Tuesday’s data. Some interpreted the acceleration in prices as a one-off caused by airline ticket costs, while others saw it as a sign that the central bank’s board of directors, known as Copom, may be soon required to adopt more aggressive rate hikes. “The continuous deterioration of short- and medium-term inflation expectations, and still strong growth momentum increase the probability that the Copom may have to accelerate the pace of rate hikes again, to 75 basis points,” Alberto Ramos, chief Latin America economist at Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, wrote in a note. The outlook is clouded by a deterioration in Brazil’s assets, with the real standing as one the worst emerging-market currencies this year. A weaker exchange rate pressures the cost of living by making imports more expensive. Investors are anxiously waiting for President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to unveil his plans to curb government outlays, which they describe as increasingly unsustainable. An announcement is expected as soon as this week. The risks “are firmly skewed to the upside, especially if the ‘spending review’ fails to soothe fears that President Lula is not taking fiscal discipline seriously,” Jason Tuvey, Deputy Chief Emerging Markets Economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a research note. --With assistance from Giovanna Serafim.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/deutsche-bank-warns-trump-tariffs-123358355.html,"Wed, Nov 27, 2024, 4:33 AM","A new president will enter the White House in 2025, but some debates remain the same. Wall Street analysts are split over the Federal Reserve’s next moves on interest rates, dissecting recent remarks from policymakers as 2024 nears its end. With just one Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting left this year, Jerome Powell and his colleagues are wrapping up a period marked by the first rate cuts in the current cycle. Optimists are hoping for a year-end rate cut in December, while others urge caution. Some banks project a steady path of cuts in 2025, potentially bringing rates to a neutral level of around 3.25%. But not everyone agrees. Analysts at firms like Deutsche Bank warn that incoming Trump-era policies, such as inflationary tariffs, could stall further rate reductions. ""There's two things. One is just the details of the underlying economy that we see now, which is the consumer has remained resilient ... the labor market looks more resilient and more stable than what we thought, and inflation has been higher over the last several months,"" said Matthew Luzzetti, chief U.S. economist at Deutsche Bank in an interview with Bloomberg TV Tuesday. ""I think you'll see that when the Fed updates their forecasts. The unemployment is going to come down, growth is going to come up, inflation is going to come up."" Luzzetti added that these factors would likely lead to a pause in the Fed's rate-cutting strategy, but continued, the new policy would compound these factors. ""Overlay with that policy changes that we expect: extensions of tax cuts, perhaps further tax cuts, tariff policy which lifts inflation. All of that leads to this dynamic of stronger growth, higher inflation that stays above 2.5% and a neutral policy rate that's closer to 4% and the Fed's above 4."" December's meeting coincides with the Fed's summary of economic projections, which is when the FOMC updates analysts on its forecasts for inflation, unemployment, growth and more. Updates reflecting an inflationary environment are unlikely to be inked into December's projection, Luzzetti added, and will instead be included in the next scheduled forecast advisory in March. Luzzetti's take is at odds with some of his peers on Wall Street. Brian Rose, UBS's senior U.S. economist, for example, is sticking by his call for continued cuts throughout next year. On Tuesday, he wrote in a note seen by Fortune: ""The market has priced out some Fed rate cuts recently, but we still expect the Fed to cut rates a total of 125 basis points by the end of 2025, bringing its target range to 3.25-3.5%, in line with our estimate of neutral. ""However, if inflation proves to be stickier than we expect, then the Fed would likely end up leaving rates closer to 4%.” While all FOMC members are invited to share their thoughts with the committee, only 12 have voting power. This alternates year-to-year, and in 2025, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee will have voting rights. With geopolitical tensions still high heading into the new year—throwing into question supply-side stability coupled with potentially inflationary supply policies—President Goolsbee outlined that he's ready to deal with the ripple effects of such events. Speaking to Matthew Klein of The Overshoot, President Goolsbee said: ""You have to figure out whether these are temporary supply shocks or permanent supply shocks. That matters a lot. ""And you have to figure out, is this a one-time cost increase but a temporary inflation shock, or is this something that’s going to keep spiraling and gets flooded into expectations?"" He explained: ""The conventional wisdom ... was you don’t tighten into a supply shock, but you try to prevent the secondary impacts on inflation. ""The direct impact of higher oil prices, there’s nothing you can do about that. You’re going to get inflation from it. But you try to prevent wage-price spiraling, you try to prevent it from getting folded into expectations where you can’t get rid of it. That’s still probably right. ""In a way we can’t yet update conventional wisdom for this episode until it’s done and we’ve actually figured out how much was supply and how much was demand.""

For Canada, energy products have accounted for about a third of its exports to the US in recent years, the largest single category. While oil and gas were excluded from tariffs in Trump’s first administration, his post on Monday said he would impose 25% tariffs on “ALL products” from Mexico and Canada on his first day in office. “The Canada-US energy partnership is more than 100 years old and is highly correlated to national security, energy security, economic security and geopolitical security,” Lisa Baiton, chief executive officer of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, said in an emailed statement. The tariffs would result in “higher gasoline and energy costs to American consumers while threatening North American energy security.” The trade group also said Trump’s threat should prompt Trudeau to reconsider policy “that kills our biggest GDP generators and job creators,” including a proposed cap on oil and gas emissions. Alberta Premier Danielle Smith similarly said in a post that Trudeau should work with Trump — who said the tariffs were needed to clamp down on migrants and illegal drugs crossing the borders — to address his “valid concerns related to illegal activities at our shared border.” The premier, whose province produces the majority of Canada’s oil, stressed that Alberta’s energy exports to the US travel through pipelines that don’t contribute to those illegal activities. “As the largest exporter of oil and gas to the US, we look forward to working with the new administration to strengthen energy security for both the US and Canada,” Smith said. --With assistance from Jay Zhao-Murray.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amgen-falls-weight-loss-shot-143840942.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 6:38 AM","(Bloomberg) -- Amgen Inc. shares fell the most in 23 years after its experimental obesity shot failed to outperform those of rivals and showed a high rate of side effects. Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field NYC's Underground Steam System May Be Key to a Greener Future NYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge The reaction shows how high the bar is for new weight-loss drugs. While patients in the yearlong trial lost as much as 20% of their body weight, analysts had said that the shot, called MariTide, would have to help patients lose about 25% to compete with drugs from Eli Lilly & Co. and Novo Nordisk A/S. Both companies are targeting that level of weight loss for their second-generation products that are now in testing. Amgen shares fell as much as 12% when markets opened Wednesday in New York, the most intraday since March 2001. Lilly shares gained as much as 4%, while shares of Novo rose as much as 4.7% in Copenhagen. About 11% of patients discontinued MariTide because of adverse events in the study, higher than discontinuation rates in key trials of the Lilly and Novo drugs. On a conference call with analysts, Amgen said the drug was associated with a 40% rate of vomiting, primarily in the first few days after the first dose. The company is studying a lower first dose that cut the rate of vomiting by about half, which it plans to use in final stage studies. As Novo and Lilly have already shown excellent results, it’s “difficult to know how MariTide fits in the market other than as a niche player for patients adamant about taking an injection less often than weekly,” Mizuho’s Jared Holz said in an email. What Bloomberg Intelligence Says: Given investor excitement ahead of this key readout, the 20% weight loss shown by Amgen’s MariTide at 52 weeks is at the low end of expectations and on par with Eli Lilly’s on-market Zepbound, while Lilly’s retatrutide and Novo Nordisk’s CagriSema will likely raise the weight-loss bar further. Discontinuation rates are in line with the class, suggesting MariTide is only differentiated by its monthly dosing, which alone is unlikely to sway payors or prescribers. -Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Justin Kim and Amena Saad. Read the research here. The Street has anxiously awaited results from the mid-stage trial of the trial, which enrolled 592 obese patients with and without diabetes. The trial, whose primary endpoint was the amount of weight lost, also assessed how long patients could go between injections and still shed pounds. The weight-loss results from the trial are comparable to what’s produced by Lilly’s Zepbound, which helped patients lose about 21% of their body weight over 72 weeks in a study. Smaller drugmakers like Amgen are vying to unseat giants Lilly and Novo in the booming obesity market, which is expected to hit $130 billion by the end of the decade. While some companies see pill versions of the popular weight-loss shots as the next frontier in the sector, Amgen is betting on a compound that can be taken less frequently. MariTide is an antibody-drug conjugate, or ADC, a type of molecule more commonly used as a targeted cancer treatment. One part of the medication, an antibody, blocks the GIP receptor, while two peptides mimic a gut hormone called GLP-1. Lilly’s blockbuster weight-loss shot Zepbound, meanwhile, mimics both hormones, rather than blocking GIP. MariTide’s “only differentiation appears to be dosing frequency,” Leerink Partners analysts said in a note. --With assistance from Naomi Kresge.

Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field NYC's Underground Steam System May Be Key to a Greener Future NYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge But for customers of Leech’s marquee Macro Opportunities strategy, trades that started off strong kept piling up in their ledgers, allegedly generating a whopping $600 million in first-day gains over less than three years — and now for Leech, criminal charges and regulatory claims. The alleged losers were two other strategies: Core and Core Plus. In parallel cases announced late Monday, the Justice Department and US Securities and Exchange Commission accused Leech, 70, of routinely waiting and assigning winning trades to accounts that produced the most revenue after he hit a rough patch in the market and faced pressure to shore up his reputation. With Leech receiving roughly half of the firm’s profits as cash bonuses, the uncanny pattern could also fatten his wallet, the SEC said. “Statistically, the probability that these differences in first-day returns occurred by random chance is less than one in 1 trillion,” the agency wrote in its lawsuit. Leech’s attorney disputed the government’s case as “unfounded,” saying his client acted properly at all times and would defend himself “vigorously.” “Ken Leech has an unblemished record over nearly 50 years as a trader and portfolio manager,” said the lawyer, Jonathan S. Sack. The charges “ignore key facts, including the fundamental differences between distinct fixed-income strategies and the irrelevance of first-day performance to managing these strategies.” Leech received no benefit from the alleged misconduct, Sack added. Investors pulled tens of billions of dollars from Wamco funds after the firm disclosed the criminal and civil investigations this year. Leech took a leave of absence in August after the SEC warned he faced an enforcement action. A spokesperson for Wamco, which is owned by Franklin Resources Inc., said it’s cooperating with investigators. Shares of Franklin Resources fell 2.8% to $22.08 at 10:54 a.m. in New York. The company sought to reassure clients in a note after the charges were filed against Leech. While Wamco said it was limited in what it could share, it stressed that it had acted quickly to respond to the crisis. “We have a strong culture of compliance, as evidenced by the fact that this trading issue was identified internally and quickly escalated, and limitations on Ken Leech’s allocations were immediately implemented,” Wamco executives, including President James W. Hirschmann III, said in the note. “We also accelerated the transition of reporting and responsibilities to other portfolio managers, in line with the succession plan we announced in August 2023. Further, we immediately launched an external investigation and have subsequently fully cooperated with the government’s investigations.” Cherry Picking The government’s narrative starts a few years ago when Leech headed into a career slump, hit by Federal Reserve interest rate moves and other outside forces that disproportionately hurt Macro Opps. A significant bet on Russian debt, for example, was almost wiped out after the country invaded Ukraine, according to prosecutors. He also oversaw an investment in Credit Suisse Group AG debt that suffered during the Swiss bank’s collapse. Over a few years, Macro Opps’ assets under management sank by 80% to less than $3 billion — a black eye for Leech, who advertised it as reflecting Wamco’s best ideas, prosecutors said. As he set out to stop withdrawals, he allegedly resorted to cherry picking trades. He typically started trading each day around 5 a.m. in California, often placing dozens of bets in general accounts with brokers through the session, according to the SEC. But breaking with practices at Wamco, he didn’t document or communicate allocations at the time of his trades, the agency said. Instead, brokers would typically send confirmations to Wamco, and then a trading assistant would attempt to reach Leech by phone to get instructions about how to allocate the trades. Leech often wouldn’t respond for hours, the SEC said. At around 1 p.m. on the West Coast, as key markets wound down and trade settlement prices were determined, he and the assistant would discuss by phone how to allocate bets, the agency claimed. The case caps a storied career. Leech joined Wamco in 1990 and became CIO eight years later. In the following two decades, he earned a reputation for making bold and often successful calls on interest rates and credit risk that helped build Wamco into a fixed-income giant. His annual bonus ranged from $28 million to $30 million per year between 2018 and 2020, when the firm was performing well, but slipped to $21 million in 2022, the SEC said. In 2023, according to the SEC, he increased his deferred compensation in the Macro Opps strategy while dropping the amount in the other two strategies. In one month alone, March 2023, he boosted his investment in Macro Opps to about $19 million from about $142,000, the agency said. The SEC alleged that because of the differing fee structures in the three funds, each dollar of assets in the Macro Opps portfolios “could generate approximately four times as much revenue for Western Asset as each dollar in Core and Core Plus portfolios.” In October 2023, Wamco began reviewing about 17,000 trades conducted by Leech between 2021 and 2023 after a company insider flagged abnormalities in the allocations, Bloomberg previously reported. The SEC and Justice Department probes followed. “We take this matter extremely seriously,” Jeaneen Terrio, a spokesperson for Wamco, said in a statement. The company has strengthened policies and practices, she said. And while the case is centered on one person, “our team of more than 100 investment professionals and outstanding client and operational support teams remain focused on serving clients,” Terrio said. Leech was charged with investment adviser fraud and securities fraud, each of which carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison; commodity trading adviser fraud and commodities fraud, both of which carry a top punishment of 10 years; and making false statements, which has a maximum penalty of five years.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chocolatiers-burned-cocoa-rally-still-150002478.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 7:00 AM","(Bloomberg) -- It looked like cocoa supplies were improving earlier this season after the worst deficit ever, giving chocolatiers paying through the nose for beans an incentive to sit out and wait for lower prices. That respite proved short-lived. Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field NYC's Underground Steam System May Be Key to a Greener Future In Italy’s Motor City, Car-Free Options Are Growing NYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge After a brief stint of softening prices, cocoa has rapidly resumed its upward climb, soaring more than 40% since a recent October low. Companies that drained their cocoa stockpiles now face the expensive task of rebuilding at costly levels, while those that let their hedges slip in hopes of snagging cheaper deals are finding themselves short on protection at a risky time. Normally, chocolate makers hedging with futures are covered eight to nine months out; today, it’s around five and a half months for the industry, according to Marex Group. “Many aren’t really interested in covering at these levels,” said Vladimir Zientek, a trading associate at financial services firm StoneX Group Inc. “Clearly everything that’s being hedged now is hand to mouth.” That’s not how bean buyers expected it to go. After cocoa prices touched an all-time record in April, the physical market was starting to cool off. Bean deliveries to ports in top grower Ivory Coast for the season that began in October are running about 30% above last year’s pace, while origin differentials — the premiums that buyers pay depending on where beans are grown — have been easing in some countries though are still “nowhere near what I would describe as average,” said Jonathan Parkman, head of agricultural sales at Marex. While chocolate makers awaited lower prices, they used up big chunks of inventories. Stockpiles held in US exchange warehouses are the lowest levels since 2005. Now, fears are mounting that heavy rains in West Africa, which led to farmer evacuations and moldy beans earlier in the season, will crimp supplies heading into the new year. The outlook for a cocoa surplus this season is “very unsteady,” said Ignacio Canals Polo, a senior associate at Bloomberg Intelligence. Companies have to stay covered to an extent and cannot rely too heavily on flexible pricing strategies, he added. “If you’re a chocolate manufacturer, you know what’s happening on the ground. But I don’t know whether you’d want to take that risk.” The next big update to this season’s production will hinge on the West African mid-crop harvest that starts in April. Until then, companies are trying to navigate the delicate balance between waiting for lower costs and still saying covered. “I expect to have clarity on cocoa prices in the next month or a couple of months,” Luca Zaramella, chief financial officer at Oreo and Toblerone maker Mondelez International Inc., said on a late October earnings call. “We haven’t locked in cocoa prices yet. We want to take advantage of the potential decline of cocoa cost, albeit we want also to be protected on the upper side of cost.” Mondelez didn’t reply to a request for comment. For now, Wall Street is awaiting higher prices. Money managers’ net-long positions were the most bullish in about nine months in the week ended Nov. 19, according to the most recent data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. On Monday, Citi Research raised its near-term cocoa price target to $10,000 a ton, noting “prospects to re-test April’s highs.” Prices are currently bouncing around the $9,000-a-ton level after peaking above $11,000 a ton in the spring. --With assistance from Mumbi Gitau.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysis-trumps-mexico-tariffs-could-160151681.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 8:01 AM","By Nick Carey LONDON (Reuters) - Donald Trump's pledge to slap tariffs on imports to the U.S. from Mexico could be more damaging for European car makers like Volkswagen and Stellantis and their suppliers than any direct tariffs on EU goods, according to data, analysts and experts. U.S. president-elect Trump said he would impose a 25% duty on imports from Canada and Mexico until they clamped down on drugs and migrants crossing the border, a move that would appear to violate a free-trade deal between the three countries. If implemented, the extra tariffs will raise questions about the future of global automakers' operations in Mexico, where many have built factories to take advantage of relatively cheap labour and close proximity to the lucrative U.S. market. Some could opt to boost operations in the United States and shift production from Mexico. Europe's luxury brands, which have neither U.S. nor Mexican production, will meanwhile be watching to see if Trump follows through with threats of European tariffs that would raise prices for U.S. buyers of their cars. European carmakers with major operations in Mexico include Stellantis and Volkswagen, whose shares fell 4.7% and 2% respectively on Tuesday. In a client note, Bernstein analysts said Trump's threats to apply tariffs soon after he takes office in January gave automakers and suppliers too little time to adapt to huge supply chain changes. ""The ... ramifications for U.S. manufacturers of Mexico and Canada tariff(s) are so large, it seems difficult to contemplate that yesterday's announcement is more than a bargaining chip at this point in time,"" they wrote. Automakers face a big hit when they are already struggling with a downturn in demand, rising costs, a slower-than-expected transition to electric vehicles and growing competition from Chinese rivals like BYD. Mexico is a mainstay of supply for the U.S. auto market. In dollar terms, the United States imported around the same amount of cars from Mexico as it did from Europe in 2023, but almost four times the amount of car parts. Nearly 80% of cars exported from Mexico between January and July this year went to the U.S. - some 1.57 million vehicles, according to the Mexican Automotive Manufacturers Association. For Stellantis, the world's 4th largest carmaker, every additional percentage point of duties on imports from Mexico could reduce pre-tax profits by about 160 million euros, or 1.4% of 2025 expectations, Intermonte analysts estimated. That equates to between 3.6 billion euros ($3.8 billion) and 4 billion euros, according to Reuters calculations. The Franco-Italian automaker is open to revising a planned push into lower-cost countries, including Mexico, should Trump impose tariffs, the head of its Ram pickup brand told Bloomberg last week. Stellantis operates two assembly plants making high-margin vehicles in Mexico: Saltillo, which makes Ram pick-ups and vans, and Toluca, for the Jeep Compass mid-sized SUV. Current tariffs on exports from Mexico to the United States vary between 0% and 2.5% based on the origin of components, Intermonte said. Some 65% of the cars that VW sells in the United States would no longer be competitive if duties were added to Mexican imports, Stifel analysts said. Its Puebla auto factory is Mexico's largest and one of the biggest in the VW Group, making nearly 350,000 cars in 2023, including the Jetta, Tiguan and Taos - all for U.S. export. The German carmaker's U.S. business is far more exposed to Mexico than its European operations would be. Shipping data shows Volkswagen U.S. has imported around 10 times as much from Mexico so far this year than it has from Europe. VW and Stellantis declined to comment on Tuesday. SOME PROTECTION Automakers and suppliers will be trying to run different scenarios without knowing what, if anything, will happen. ""Based on what we've seen with Trump in the past, he'll use the threat of tariffs as leverage,"" said Nick Klein, a Chicago-based vice president at global logistics firm OEC Group. ""But it's impossible to say what he'll do."" Some companies are well-positioned to step up U.S. production, potentially blunting the impact of tariffs, although few have cash to splash during the current downturn. Mercedes-Benz and BMW could produce more at their U.S. plants, but new models would require hefty investments in tooling. Both German automakers export cars from the U.S., which could qualify them for tariff refunds. More than half the 410,793 cars built at BMW's Spartanburg, South Carolina plant in 2023 were exported. Some of those could instead be sold locally, CEO Oliver Zipse told analysts during a Nov. 6 call. ""There's some natural cover-up against possible tariffs,"" he said. The rise in U.S. protectionism under presidents Trump and Joe Biden, plus supply chain shocks during the COVID pandemic, mean many suppliers have already invested in plants there. U.S. investments by European automakers and suppliers are mostly in states like South Carolina that generally vote for Trump's Republican Party. European firms have accounted for $12 billion, or 58%, of $20.7 billion in automotive investments there since 2006 - dwarfing the $3.8 billion from U.S. firms. Around 40% of the state's top-tier suppliers are German or French. Continental, which has plants in Mississippi, Ohio, South Carolina and Illinois, ""follows the principle 'local for local', and therefore we produce in the U.S. for the U.S. market,"" said CFO Olaf Schick.

He sees a risk of this happening soon after Trump takes office in January. The dollar has been rallying on expectation Trump will impose higher levies on its main trading partners, fanning inflation and limiting the Federal Reserve’s ability to cut interest rates. An index of the greenback’s strength hit the highest in two years and many expect it to continue to rise. “It could well be that in the first quarter of next year we start to see a contrary movement” on the dollar, said Hirt. This “will take many by surprise because that’s not at all what is anticipated.” Trump said he would impose additional 10% tariffs on goods from China and 25% tariffs on all products from Mexico and Canada in posts to his Truth Social network on Monday. China responded on Tuesday by defending its track record and refrained from mentioning any planned retaliation. Hirt said retaliatory tariffs would have an outsized impact on the dollar because the market has been heavily positioned in its favor. Speculative traders boosted bets on dollar gains in the week ending Nov. 19 to the most bullish level since late June, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. AllianzGI, which has $590 billion in assets under management and is owned by global financial services group Allianz, is looking to reverse some of the long dollar positions it has held since before the US presidential election. A fall in the euro below $1.05 could provide such an opportunity, as Hirt says the currency is unlikely to reach parity with the dollar. The common currency could also get a boost from a stronger German economy if the government that wins the snap election in February announces stimulus measures. Friedrich Merz, who heads the front-runner party, has indicated he may reform the country’s restrictions on borrowing, which could open the door to much needed investment. “Elections in Germany could surprise markets positively,” Hirt said, adding he increased an overweight position in European bonds after the US vote. “It could pull the whole of Europe out of a potentially recessionary environment.” Hirt also favors the yen as he believes the Bank of Japan could raise interest rates as soon as next month. He likes UK assets as Britain’s economic growth has been stronger than in the euro area and the political background seems to have stabilized.

US stock futures steadied after erasing early declines. Trump vowed to place an extra 10% tariffs on Chinese imports and 25% levies on all products from Mexico and Canada. The measures are needed to clamp down on migrants and illegal drugs flowing across the US border, he said on his Truth Social Network. “We’re just seeing the start of the volatility and the volatility is going to continue as the rhetoric continues,” said Justin Onuekwusi, CIO at St. James’s Place. “It is very difficult to assess if it is a threat, promise or negotiation tool.” The Canadian dollar fell to a four-year low on the news, while the Mexican peso traded close to its weakest since 2022.

Tuesday’s market moves unwound many of the trades from the previous session on Trump’s nomination of Scott Bessent as his Treasury Secretary, a hedge fund manager with a Wall Street mindset. “We would view this as a timely intervention from President-elect Trump that sends a very clear signal to the financial markets — that the reaction to the nomination of Scott Bessent was wrong — there will be no soft or balanced approach to trade tariff policy,” said Derek Halpenny at MUFG Bank Ltd. While Bessent has at times suggested that Trump is signaling a maximalist approach as a negotiation tactic, he signaled strong support for tariffs in an op-ed for Fox News on Nov. 15. China’s benchmark stock index swung between gains and losses, outperforming most of its regional peers.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-trade-partners-warn-trump-165652637.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 8:56 AM","(Reuters) - Officials from Mexico, Canada and China warned U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's threat of imposing hefty tariffs on goods from the three largest U.S. trading partners would harm the economies of all involved and would risk aggravating inflation and damaging job markets. In their initial round of responses to Trump's surprise announcement on Monday for a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico and an additional 10% levy on Chinese goods until they clamped down on illicit drugs and migrants crossing the border, leaders and other top officials urged dialogue and cooperation. ""To one tariff will come another and so on, until we put our common businesses at risk,"" Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said during a regular press conference. Sheinbaum said she planned to send a letter to Trump and would seek a call with him to discuss the issue. A Bank of Canada official, meanwhile, said it was clear that any move by Trump to deliver on the threat would reverberate on both sides of the U.S. northern border. ""What happens in the U.S. has a big impact on us, and something like this would clearly have an impact on both economies,"" Deputy Governor Rhys Mendes said during an audience question and answer session in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island. Earlier, a spokesperson for China's embassy in Washington said: ""No one will win a trade war or a tariff war."" As of September, U.S. Commerce Department data showed the three countries had shipped more than $1 trillion of goods to the United States in the first nine months of the year, with Mexico ranking first, followed by China and then Canada. FOCUS ON FENTANYL Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, had pledged throughout his campaign to levy tariffs of varying degrees on U.S. trading partners, part of his promise to ""put America first."" Imposing import duties was a major policy plank during his first four-year term and, like now, he has also threatened them for non-economic reasons. In 2019, he threatened 5% tariffs on Mexico to achieve its cooperation in tightening border controls. In the current case, the flow into the U.S. of illicit drugs, particularly fentanyl, was added to his mix of grievances with the three countries. The number of U.S. deaths from fentanyl overdoses actually declined in 2023, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, although nearly 75,000 people still succumbed to the powerful opioid. Regarding China specifically, Trump in a posting on his social media site said: ""Until such time as they stop, we will be charging China an additional 10% Tariff, above any additional Tariffs, on all of their many products coming into the United States of America."" It was not entirely clear what this would mean for China as he has previously pledged to end China's most-favored-nation trading status and slap tariffs on Chinese imports in excess of 60% - much higher than those imposed during his first term. Trump's threatened new tariffs would appear to violate the terms of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) on trade. The deal, which Trump signed into law, took effect in 2020 and continued the largely duty-free trade between the three countries, although the deal sunsets in 2026. Warren Murayama, former general counsel for the U.S. Trade Representative under President George H.W. Bush, said Trump's threat could be acted on with relative ease by making a national emergency declaration, which would unlock the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. ""If precedent is any indication, it's a serious uphill fight,"" to challenge actions taken under that umbrella. Trump's broadside late on Monday sent the Mexican and Canadian currencies tumbling, although U.S. stock markets largely took the development in stride, with many investors seeing it as the opening bid to a nomination than as a certainty. Shares of some companies seen particularly vulnerable, such as automakers Ford and General Motors, fell sharply. ""Given the post makes an explicit reference to the flow of people and drugs across the southern and northern borders, it suggests this specific tariff threat is more of a negotiating tool than a revenue raiser,"" said Thomas Ryan, North America Economist at Capital Economics. ""It leaves the door open to Canada and Mexico coming up with a credible plan over the next two months to try and avoid those tariffs.""

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/israel-deliberates-cease-fire-end-154404615.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 7:44 AM","(Bloomberg) -- Israel’s security cabinet began deliberating a cease-fire with Lebanon-based Hezbollah, according to an Israeli official, even as the air force conducted simultaneous heavy strikes on Beirut. Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field NYC's Underground Steam System May Be Key to a Greener Future NYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge The meeting of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s top coalition members started Tuesday afternoon, said the official, with a vote likely to take place later on a US-drafted proposal. If they approve the plan without calling for significant changes — which would require Hezbollah’s consent — a 60-day cease-fire could potentially start immediately. Oil and gold prices have fallen this week, with traders optimistic a truce would help calm the Middle East. The Israeli shekel’s also strengthened. The talks are taking place after Israel said eight of its warplanes struck 20 Hezbollah targets in the southern suburbs of Beirut, in one of its most intense bombardments of the city to date. The military earlier asked residents in several buildings to leave immediately, and plumes of smoke were seen rising from many locations. Hezbollah fired projectiles into Israel and sirens sounded in northern areas of the country, including the city of Haifa. One of the security cabinet’s roughly 10 members, National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir, is opposed to a deal, arguing that Israel should continue its military campaign and crush Hezbollah. Some mayors of northern Israeli towns devastated by rocket and drone salvos from the Iranian-backed group over the past 13 months have made similar comments. Still, it’s likely Netanyahu can get approval for a deal even without the support of Ben-Gvir. The full agreement hasn’t been made public. Broadly, it says Hezbollah fighters must retreat north of the Litani River, about 30 kilometers (19 miles) away from the Israeli border. The Lebanese army, which is separate from Hezbollah, will deploy more forces in the south of the country to beef up a contingent of United Nations peacekeepers, helping to ensure the militant group doesn’t operate there. The Israel Defense Forces earlier said its troops had reached the Litani, about two months after they began a ground incursion of Lebanon. Israel has insisted on being able to strike Hezbollah positions if it deems the organization is breaching the cease-fire terms. The Lebanese government and Hezbollah have said they won’t accept that. It’s unclear how the proposal squares those positions. Lebanon’s Prime Minister Najib Mikati is expected to speak on Tuesday evening to confirm the country’s approval of a cease-fire following an Israeli announcement, according to Lebanese media. Sharren Haskel, Israel’s deputy foreign minister, who’s not a security cabinet member, said the process of implementing a truce would become clear only after a vote. “It is a very sensitive time,” she told reporters ahead of the meeting. “There needs to be a discussion. There might be a vote as well. And on whether and how this will be conducted, then we will know the rest of the process as well.” Around 2,500 people have been killed in Lebanon by Israeli strikes and the ground offensive in the past two months, while 1.2 million — more than a fifth of the population — have been displaced. About 50 Israeli troops have been killed in combat in southern Lebanon. Israel and Hezbollah have been in conflict since the latter began striking Israeli territory in October 2023 in solidarity with Hamas. Both Hezbollah and Hamas, which triggered the ongoing war in Gaza with its attack on southern Israel, are designated as terrorist organizations by the US and many other countries. Talks between Israel and Hamas over a cease-fire in Gaza have stalled for months. Though the conflicts are connected, there’s little sign a deal over Lebanon would increase the chances of a truce in Gaza. (Updates with more detail.)

The loan, part of the DOE’s Energy’s Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing (ATVM) program, would support the construction of Rivian’s upcoming assembly plant located outside of Atlanta. Rivian paused development of the site back in March due to concerns about its capital position. At the time, Rivian said building its upcoming R2 vehicles at its existing Normal, Ill., plant instead would save the company over $2 billion in costs. If finalized, the new DOE loan would restart Rivan’s plans to develop the Georgia assembly plant. Rivian stock opened lower but reversed higher in midday trade. ""This loan would enable Rivian to more aggressively scale our US manufacturing footprint for our competitively priced R2 and R3 vehicles that emphasize both capability and affordability,” CEO RJ Scaringe said in a statement. “A robust ecosystem of US companies developing and manufacturing EVs is critical for the US to maintain its long-term leadership in transportation."" Rivian said it must satisfy certain technical, legal, environmental, and financial conditions before the DOE enters into the loan agreement. If finalized, Rivian said it would build the facility in two phases, each resulting in 200,000 units of annual production capacity, for a total of 400,000 units of annual capacity, which Rivian claims would support the “sale of American EVs in international markets.” Phase 1 of the project is expected to start production in 2028. In the meantime, Rivian will continue to pursue building its volume R2 and R3 vehicles at the Normal plant, with production slated for the first half of 2026. Rivian notes that other American automakers have taken advantage of similar government-backed loan programs, including Tesla (TSLA), GM (GM), and Ford (F), including battery supply chain companies like Redwood Materials and Lithium Americas. Rivian securing conditional approval of the $6.6 billion DOE loan comes on the heels of another big financial win for the company. In mid-November, the company announced an expansion of its partnership with Volkswagen (VWAGY), with the German automaker pouring more money into a joint venture. Volkswagen will increase its total deal investment to $5.8 billion from $5 billion. The joint venture will begin operations in North America and eventually expand to Europe. It will also support the development of electric vehicles in the subcompact segment, the companies said. In terms of its cash cushion, Rivian said it ended the third quarter with $7.85 billion in cash and equivalents, and the company said at the time it still expects ""to reach a modest gross profit"" in the fourth quarter of this year. One big wrinkle in that plan is the status of the federal EV tax credit, which the incoming Trump transition team has indicated may be repealed. Pure-play automakers like Rivian, Lucid (LCID), and Tesla could be most affected by the tax credit’s removal. Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

(AP) — Atlantic City is finally getting a beach replenishment project that casinos say is essential for visitors who have had precious little space to spread their towels for two sand-starved summers. Work is under way on a project by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to widen beaches in Atlantic City and some neighboring shore towns. It will place 1.2 million cubic yards of sand on the shoreline — enough to fill as many as 120,000 dump trucks — to make up for losses from normal tides as well as stronger, more frequent storms fueled by climate change. Atlantic City last received beach replenishment in 2020, and was due for additional sand in 2023. But Congress failed to approve funding for the project then, and the $38.2 million in funding that came through this year was too late for this summer. While the project should have wider beaches in place for next summer’s tourism season, the lack of sand has hurt business the past two years. Resorts Casino Hotel has had a usable beach every year except this one, said Mark Giannantonio, the casino's president. “You have thousands of people here on a nice summer day and there’s no beach for them to go on,” he said. “It affects every business from the largest casino to the smallest pizzeria.” The Hard Rock, Ocean and Resorts casinos are in the most heavily eroded section of Atlantic City's beach and they pushed federal officials to expedite the project. In 2023, Ocean decided it simply couldn't wait any longer, and spent $600,000 of its own money to truck sand onto the beach in front of the casino. But that sand quickly washed away, and Ocean's beach was even smaller this summer. “For a destination resort, which is what we present ourselves as, it’s absolutely imperative to have a beach,” said Bill Callahan, Ocean’s general manager. “It affects us when people come down and see that it’s not here."" Most of project involves widening beaches in the most heavily eroded north end of Atlantic City, although portions of neighboring Ventnor will be included as well. And in the nearby beach towns of Margate and Longport, repairs are planned for dunes, sand fencing, access paths and crossovers, and dune grass will be planted. The work should be completed in two to four months, the Army Corps said. Further north, beach replenishment is also ongoing in Harvey Cedars, Beach Haven and Long Beach Township on Long Beach Island. ___ Follow Wayne Parry on X at www.twitter.com/WayneParryAC","ATLANTIC N.J. is getting a beach project casinos say is essential visitors who had precious little space to spread their for sand-starved Work under way project by the Army of beaches Atlantic City some neighboring shore towns.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) lagged, dropping 0.3% after the index notched its latest record. Markets were initially caught off guard by Trump's pledge late Monday to slap big tariffs on the US's biggest trading partners from his first day in office. His comments fired up trade war fears and dented Wall Street hopes that Treasury secretary nominee Scott Bessent would rein in any extreme moves by the new administration. Wall Street appeared to take Trump's move in its stride, with stocks mostly holding onto the Bessent-bounce gains on Monday that lifted the Dow to a record high. Debate focused on Trump's record as president of using policy threats as a negotiation starting point, then not fully delivering on them. Meanwhile, European carmaker stocks fell on the heels of Trump's ""America First"" push. Nissan and Honda Motor (HMC), which have auto plants in Mexico, came under pressure. In currencies, the Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar dropped sharply as the US dollar rallied.

The world's largest retail chain told Yahoo Finance that it would cease using the acronym DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion), no longer participate in a corporate equality rating system created by the Human Rights Campaign and end its $100 million Center for Racial Equity that was scheduled to sunset in 2025. The company will also remove from its available merchandise all sexually inappropriate and transgender products marketed to children, review its supplier diversity program to ensure that no preferences are made based on race, and stop using the term ""LatinX"" in official communications to refer to people of Latin American cultural or ethnic identities. A spokesman for Walmart said the changes did not come about suddenly. ""We’ve been on a journey and know we aren’t perfect, but every decision comes from a place of wanting to foster a sense of belonging, to open doors to opportunities for all our associates, customers and suppliers and to be a Walmart for everyone,"" the company said in a statement. Similar changes discarding DEI initiatives have been picking up momentum at other major US corporations in recent months as critics target what they describe as ""woke"" policies. Home improvement giant Lowe’s (LOW), rural retailer Tractor Supply (TSCO) and tractor maker John Deere (DE) also announced retreats from DEI policies last summer. Harley-Davidson, Jack Daniel’s maker Brown-Foreman (BF-A), Polaris (PII), and its motorcycle subsidiary Indian Motorcycle are among the other recent pullbacks. Conservative activist Robby Starbuck has said many these discarded diversity initiatives happened after he communicated plans to ""expose"" woke policies. He did so again on Monday with Walmart, saying in a post on X that he told executives at the retailer that he was ""doing a story on wokeness there"" and ""we had productive conversations to find solutions."" Citing the company's changes, he added that ""this is the biggest win yet for our movement to end wokeness in corporate America."" A US Supreme Court ruling last year has been cited as a factor in corporate decisions to alter diversity policies. The court specifically ruled against race-conscious student admissions programs at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina, saying the programs violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Republican-led states have pushed companies to rescind race-based employee quotas, piggybacking on that 2023 high court decision. DEI was also a hot-button issue during the 2024 presidential campaign. A top Trump ally has called DEI ""bigotry"" against white men.

Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field NYC's Underground Steam System May Be Key to a Greener Future NYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge The deal terms “do not reflect in any way the underlying profitability and the additional potential for value creation for Banco BPM shareholders,” the lender said in a statement on Tuesday. The note was unanimously approved by board members and represents a preliminary analysis of UniCredit’s offer “in the best interest of the shareholders.” The offer terms, including a 0.5% premium that has since turned into a discount, are unusual for operations of this type, the bank said. Banco BPM’s board also highlighted that UniCredit’s takeover would reduce competitiveness in the Italian market, and would affect jobs. UniCredit Chief Executive Officer Andrea Orcel surprised investors Monday with an all share offer for Banco BPM, a lender involved in a series of recent deals that could create a new force in Italian banking. The move could complicate government efforts to form a major banking group around BPM and Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA to rival UniCredit and Intesa Sanpaolo SpA, the country’s dominant firms. UniCredit’s all-stock offer values Banco BPM at around €9.6 billion, based on Monday’s closing prices. Shares of Banco BPM extended gains Tuesday, rising 0.5% at 12:16 p.m. for a total market value of about €10.7 billion. That suggests investors see potential for the bid to be raised. A combination of the two banks “would undoubtedly have significant industrial value,” Equita analyst Andrea Lisi said in a note on Monday. “However, we recognize that the premium is limited.” Orcel’s bid comes after Banco BPM bought a 5% stake in Monte Paschi from the government. That stake would rise if Banco BPM succeeds in acquiring asset manager Anima Holding SpA, which also owns shares in Monte Paschi. Banco BPM’s investors include Credit Agricole SA, with a stake of around 9%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The French lender may have increased its holding to 19% through equity swaps, newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore reported Tuesday, citing “rumors circulating in trading rooms.” Credit Agricole hasn’t asked regulators for authorization to own more than 10% in Banco BPM, a spokeswoman for the French bank said. Orcel informed Banco BPM chairman Massimo Tononi about his intention to launch a bid before announcing the move on Monday, Bloomberg has reported. Milan, Italy-headquartered UniCredit is simultaneously considering an acquisition of Frankfurt, Germany-based Commerzbank AG, though the potential deal faces stiff government opposition.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/faltering-us-offshore-wind-industry-120011221.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 4:00 AM","(Bloomberg) -- Off the coast of Mississippi, a startup has completed its first floating platform for offshore wind turbines. Aikido Technologies Inc.’s solution would allow companies to deploy traditional turbines further from land, where the wind tends to blow stronger and more consistently, and the company sees the Mississippi deployment as a big step toward commercialization. Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field NYC's Underground Steam System May Be Key to a Greener Future NYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge But despite being US-based and backed by the federal government, Aikido isn’t banking on the country to be its main or even a major market for its technology due to the industry’s challenging economics domestically. President-Elect Donald Trump has also been openly hostile toward offshore wind. Aikido’s floating platform cuts construction time in half compared to conventional platforms, according to the company. It does so in part because its unique steel structure can be assembled with no welding involved, said co-founder and Chief Executive Sam Kanner. The startup developed its novel approach with support from tech incubator Otherlab, Bill Gates’ Breakthrough Energy Fellows program and the Energy Department. About two-thirds of US offshore wind resources are in waters too deep to tether turbines to the seabed — the traditional approach — according to the Energy Department. Some states, notably California, see floating offshore wind as a means to overcome that barrier and power millions of homes. Trump, though, has vowed to stymie offshore wind on day one via executive order and nominated a fracking boss who has expressed opposition to renewable subsidies to lead the Energy Department. Kanner expects projects awaiting approval in US federal waters will be “delayed for some time.” The industry is also battling supply chain issues and inflation in the US. Large projects in New York and Connecticut have been canceled or delayed, despite the Biden administration prioritizing offshore wind. Rather than waiting for a shift in US politics or improving economic conditions, the California-based startup sees development abroad as the key to its success. The offshore wind sector has enjoyed consistent support, high price caps and favorable incentives in countries like Scotland, which also boasts a large workforce and has high resource development potential, Kanner said, adding that “it really feels like the market’s going to take off there in the next couple of years.” The country currently has about 3 megawatts of offshore wind capacity, and areas off the coast could host about 5.4 gigawatts of floating wind, according to data from BloombergNEF. A gigawatt of power is roughly equal to the output of a nuclear power plant. Aikido is also eyeing France, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea as part of its expansion plans.

Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field NYC's Underground Steam System May Be Key to a Greener Future In Italy’s Motor City, Car-Free Options Are Growing NYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge Gazprom’s plans, which are yet to be approved by management, set out a base-case scenario where no gas transits through Ukraine when the current deal ends at the end of the year, according to a person familiar with the matter. Reuters first reported the news. Although flows through Ukraine now account for less than 5% of the continent’s supplies, some central European countries still rely on this supply and have been exploring alternatives, including a deal with Azerbaijan. But with just weeks left to find a solution, no agreement has been reached yet. Gazprom declined to comment. With tensions escalating in Ukraine, whether gas flows on Jan. 1 is becoming a political decision. Moscow has maintained it’s willing to continue to supply gas but Kyiv is reluctant to keep enabling a key source of income for Russia. European gas markets have been volatile because of the uncertainty about whether an alternative can be agreed to get Russian gas to the region and gas prices in Europe are near their highest level this year. Nations such as Slovakia still depend on the Russian shipments as other supplies, such as liquefied natural gas, would be more expensive. Should flows stop, replenishing inventories in Europe would be much more difficult next year. Stored fuel is already being used up more rapidly than usual for this time of year after a colder start to winter. Europe, while reducing its dependence on Russian pipeline gas, increasingly depends on imports of LNG from Moscow and also the US. Slovakia has been pitching back up routes should talks fail. But time is running out with new obstacles emerging. Austria’s OMV AG was cut off from Gazprom’s supply this month after stopping payments following an arbitration award, and the US sanctioned Gazprombank which handles payments for Russian gas supplies in Europe.

Banks are expected to post $475 million in fixed-income, currencies and commodities trading (FICC) revenue linked to Israel in 2024, a more than 10% increase from 2023, amid increased volatility primarily in the shekel, the Israeli currency, data from Vali Analytics Ltd show. The revenue rise illustrates how global banks are making money on price gyrations in Israeli assets as the country's wars in Gaza and Lebanon grind on. The conflicts have boosted Israeli inflation, limited economic growth and increased borrowing costs. JPMorgan Chase & Co., the largest U.S. bank, is expected to be the top gainer among 10 global lenders surveyed by the data firm, raking in about $70 million so far this year from such trades, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Though that is a tiny fraction of global trading income, the double-digit increase highlights how trading Israeli assets has been a bright spot in otherwise muted trading activity this year. Vali Analytics expects the 10 global banks to post no growth in FICC income overall this year. Goldman and Citigroup have the biggest share of the Israeli FICC market after JPMorgan, the person added, while European banks have a smaller portion. Goldman, Citi and JPMorgan declined to comment. Under pressure from activists and governments, some of Europe's biggest financial firms have cut back their links to Israeli companies or those with ties to the country, Reuters reported earlier this month. Reuters could not establish how European banks fared in the trading rankings. JPMorgan has been investing in Israel, where it opened its office in Tel Aviv in 2000. It currently has about 200 employees there. BIGGER SWINGS JPMorgan's global income from fixed-income markets trading declined by 2% to $14.7 billion in the nine months to September compared to the same period last year, according to a bank filing. Volatility favours traders who bet on the future direction of an asset. Early this month, the shekel's one-month implied volatility closed at its highest level since October 2023. It began to trade consistently above euro volatility in early 2023 - with the bigger peaks and troughs creating money-making opportunities for traders. ""Israeli currency volatility has increased as a result first of more divided politics and concerns over institutional stability with the controversial judicial reform and then, obviously, the war on multiple fronts,"" said Hasnain Malik, head of emerging and frontier markets equity strategy at Tellimer. The Israeli government passed a series of laws in 2023 aimed at neutering the powers of Israel's Supreme Court in favour of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's executive branch, alarming investors. The conflict in the region that followed further increased swings in markets. The shekel has strengthened by nearly 3% against the dollar this month due in part to hopes for a ceasefire deal between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon. ""That volatility suits banks whose spreads widen but hurts operating businesses exposed to imported inputs or exported finished products,"" Tellimer's Malik said.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/companies-bolster-currency-hedges-trump-175616447.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 9:56 AM","By Laura Matthews and Saqib Iqbal Ahmed NEW YORK (Reuters) - Multinational companies are beefing up their foreign exchange hedging strategies to guard their overseas earnings from larger currency swings that could come from a second Donald Trump presidency. Since the U.S. election three weeks ago, strategists and bankers said they are seeing more interest in options and cross-currency swaps as companies, including those in healthcare and industrial sectors, focus on how volatile currencies may be under Trump. ""The election is a big catalyst for hedgers to think about currency risk,"" said Karl Schamotta, chief market strategist at payments company Corpay in Toronto. ""Businesses that for a long time were relatively comfortable with the direction and the scale of exchange-rate moves are being shocked out of that complacency."" Trump's election is introducing volatility into foreign-exchange markets as his victory clears the way for tariffs and protectionist trade policies that were the hallmark of his first term. Trump said on Monday he would impose a 25% tariff on all products from Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% tariff on Chinese goods, on his first day in office, citing concerns over illegal immigration and illicit drugs. The news prompted the peso to drop as much as 2% while the Canadian dollar fell as much as 1.4%. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency's strength against six peers, has risen 3.5% since the Nov. 5 election, broadly on expectations Trump's policies on trade and tariffs will be dollar-supportive. Scott Bessent, Trump's U.S. Treasury secretary pick, has favored a strong dollar and supported tariffs. Adding to the uncertainty is the 2026 review of the United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement that outlined tariff provisions and was implemented during Trump's first term. Trump has said he intends to make the agreement ""a much better deal,"" although details of changes are unclear. Trump's first term, which was marked by big swings in trade-sensitive currencies, highlighted the need for more hedging, analysts said. At the same time, global central banks are trying to normalize interest-rate policy while balancing growth and inflation concerns, another potential source of volatility in the coming months. About 94% of senior finance decision-makers at UK and U.S. companies in a Nov. 7-18 MillTechFX survey said the U.S. election outcome was prompting them to change their foreign-exchange hedging strategies. Some are seeking to extend the duration of hedges, while others look to bump up their hedge ratios - the proportion of their overall foreign-exchange exposure that is protected. LOWER FOREIGN REVENUE Among currencies that companies are looking to hedge are the Mexican peso and the euro. A stronger dollar means U.S. companies' foreign revenue is worth less when converted to dollars, which erodes profits. The S&P 500 generates 41% of revenues outside the U.S., according to John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet. The Mexican peso, which has fallen 2% since the election and nearly 17% year-to-date as of Monday's close, is particularly in Trump's crosshairs. The close U.S. trading partner is vulnerable to tariffs, which could disrupt corporate supply chains. Although the interest-rate differential between the U.S. and Mexico has tightened since the election, the cost of hedging long peso positions has increased because of the peso's slide, said Paula Comings, head of foreign-exchange sales at US Bank. ""Those selling MXN and buying dollars may be reluctant right now to add to forward hedging volumes, but are looking at options as a possible alternative,"" Comings said. Businesses are also faced with tighter credit criteria from lenders and rising hedging costs, said Tom Hoyle, business development director at MillTechFX, a currency trading platform, which has increased FX option use. ""Ultimately, if businesses want to protect themselves longer-term, they will either have to absorb higher costs or look for alternatives,"" he added. Many companies expect trade uncertainty to weigh heavily on East Asia and Europe as well, according to the survey. Comings said the impact on the euro, down some 4% against the dollar since the election, was not priced in ahead of the election as much as in Mexico's and China's currencies. It is now being pressured by tariff talks, an ailing German economy and weakness in manufacturing across parts of Europe. Comings is seeing some U.S. healthcare and industrial companies express interest in using euro cross-currency swaps to manage currency risks and lower their interest payments. Yearly return on these euro/dollar contracts has risen since the election to as much as 2% on contracts two years or longer, underlining the allure of these contracts. ""The election results have exacerbated the need to understand at what rates some firms may not be able to afford doing international business if added tariffs and/or regulations are something that will also need to be accounted for,"" said Juan Perez, director of trading at Monex USA.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/small-business-owners-breathe-easier-155519057.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 7:55 AM","Small business owners have had a mostly positive reaction to a judge's decision to strike down an overtime rule that would have qualified more workers for overtime pay. On Nov. 15, a federal judge in Texas blocked a new rule from the Biden administration that would have expanded access to overtime pay to millions more salaried workers across the U.S. Nearly all hourly workers in the U.S. are entitled to overtime pay after 40 hours a week. But many salaried workers are exempt from that requirement — unless they earn below a certain level. The now-scuttled rule would have marked the biggest increase to that cap in decades. As of July 1, employers were required to pay overtime to staffers who make $43,888 a year in certain executive, administrative and professional roles — and that would have risen to $58,656 a year as of Jan. 1. But now the previous threshold of $35,568 — which was set in 2019 under the Trump administration — is back in effect. The judge said the department could not prioritize employee wages over job duties when determining eligibility. Guillaume Drew, founder of Or & Zon, a New York company that sells sustainable home goods online with 12 staffers, said overturning the rule helps him keep labor costs and prices of goods down, particularly for future employees, since none of his current staffers would have been affected. But he said it's still important employees are paid fairly for their time and effort. Because the ruling was overturned, he'll probably offer employees incentives like spa days and letting them work from home rather than overtime pay. “Companies need to find an equilibrium between being financially viable and caring about employees,” he said. Sheldon Sutherland, owner of Epoxy Werx, a San Diego-based business with 12 employees specializing in epoxy flooring, said the ruling is positive for his company. “As a small business, managing labor costs is critical, and the proposed change would have increased expenses significantly,” he said. “The decision allows us to maintain current pay structures, ensuring financial stability while continuing to offer competitive wages.” Small business organizations also applauded the measure. “Although blocking any increase to the threshold fails to take into account inflation, the Department of Labor tried to do too much too fast resulting in sticker shock for small businesses that are still recovering from the pandemic,"" said Small Business Majority Founder & CEO John Arensmeyer. ""More measured and predictable increases are in order.” Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council president & CEO Karen Kerrigan added that the ruling will help struggling small business owners. “It will allow employers to align their compensation approach with the needs and flexibility of the individual worker and marketplace,” she said. ""Small business owners and their workers are both better served by the court’s ruling.” Not everyone thought the move was a good one for small businesses, however. Stephanie Penn, owner of Tee & Honey, an online t-shirt boutique based in Southfield, Michigan, said fair pay, including overtime, is good for morale and leads to better productivity. Two of her employees were affected by the July 1 ruling and one would’ve been affected if the higher cap went into effect on Jan. 1. “From a business perspective, having clearer guidelines around overtime pay also helps to avoid potential disputes or misunderstandings about compensation,” she said. “By striking down the rule, it places a heavier burden on businesses like mine, which strive to do right by their employees, while also leaving room for inequities that could harm both morale and retention.”","Small business owners have a mostly positive reaction to a decision to strike down an overtime rule that would more overtime pay.

On Tuesday, the group published a project on the AI dev platform Hugging Face seemingly connected to OpenAI's Sora API, which isn't yet publicly available. Using their authentication tokens — presumably from an early access system — the group created a frontend that lets users generate videos with Sora. Through the group's frontend, any user can generate 10-second videos up to 1080p resolution. When TechCrunch tried, the queue was quite long — but several users on X managed to upload samples. So why did the group do this? They claim that OpenAI is pressuring Sora's early testers, including red teamers and creative partners, to spin a positive narrative around Sora and failing to fairly compensate them for their work. ""Hundreds of artists provide unpaid labor through bug testing, feedback and experimental work for the [Sora early access] program for a $150B valued [sic] company,"" the group wrote in a post attached to the frontend. ""This early access program appears to be less about creative expression and critique, and more about PR and advertisement."" The group also claims that OpenAI is being misleading about Sora's capabilities by keeping early access users on a tight leash. Every Sora output needs to be approved by OpenAI before it's shared, they say, and only a few creators in the program will be selected to have their Sora-created works screened. ""We are not against the use of AI technology as a tool for the arts (if we were, we probably wouldn't have been invited to this program),"" the wrote. ""What we don't agree with is how this artist program has been rolled out and how the tool is shaping up ahead of a possible public release. We are sharing this to the world in the hopes that OpenAI becomes more open, more artist friendly and supports the arts beyond PR stunts."" We've reached out to Hugging Face and OpenAI for comment and will update this piece once we hear back. Since its debut earlier this year, Sora has suffered technical setbacks as rivals in the video generation space feverishly work to overtake it. Not helping matters, one of the co-leads on Sora, Tim Brooks, left OpenAI for Google in early October. In a recent Reddit AMA, OpenAI chief product officer Kevin Weil said that Sora was being held back by the ""need to perfect the model, get safety/impersonation/other things right, and scale compute."" Per The Information, the original system, revealed in February, took more than 10 minutes of processing time to make a 1-minute video clip. The leaked Sora seems to be a faster, ""turbo"" variant, according to code uncovered by X users. The code also reveals the existence of style controls and limited customization options.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-salinas-stock-trapped-bizarre-163457763.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 8:34 AM","(Bloomberg) -- Ricardo Salinas Pliego is no stranger to controversy and crisis. Over decades, the entrepreneur has feuded with business partners, investors and regulators as he built an empire that’s made him Mexico’s third-richest person. But even for Salinas, the current financial predicament is dire — and also a little odd. That’s because the bulk of his $10.5 billion wealth is tied up in a company, Grupo Elektra, that is poised to plunge in value as soon as it begins trading again on the Mexican stock exchange. This is where things get weird. Officials have been trying for days to lift the halt on the stock that was imposed in July, only to give up once buy orders hit trading screens in the pre-market auction. The problem: the bids are so shockingly low, coming in at less than 50% of the stock’s value in July, that the market circuit breaker designed to limit volatility is immediately tripped, and the stock is halted again without a single transaction taking place. So for official bookkeeping reasons, Elektra’s shares are still worth the same 944.95 pesos they were quoted at on July 26, and Salinas’ wealth remains, precariously for now, intact. The cause of the initial ban was, like many things involving Salinas, a bit mysterious. Salinas himself had triggered the trading halt in July when he alleged a creditor had used the company shares to fund a $110 million loan. Lawyers for the billionaire said most of the shares appeared to have been sold, pushing the stock price down — with the rest allegedly pocketed by the creditor. The creditor has denied any wrongdoing. Index Suspension What followed the allegations of fraud was easier to understand — after a month of no trading, Elektra got booted from the country’s main stock gauge, leaving it without the crucial support of index-tracking funds needed to support the share price. Which is why traders have been lobbing in such lowball bids when the exchange tried to restart trading. In another unusual twist, lawyers for Salinas are fighting in court to prevent the stock from trading. On Friday morning, Elektra said that resuming trading would cause “irreparable damage to the company” adding that the exchange and regulators would be responsible for any “adverse effects.” It is, analysts said, a not-so-veiled play to keep the stock price from collapsing. “It’s a golden cage — looks real pretty but it’s still a cage,” said Carlos Legaspy, chief executive officer of broker-dealer Insight Securities Inc. A spokesperson for the billionaire didn’t respond to requests for comment on Elektra or his wealth. Legal battles Salinas has won legal rulings against the Mexican exchange before. Back in 2012, his lawyers filed lawsuits against exchange officials and successfully beat back an attempt to kick it off the same index. Officials had alleged the company was manipulating the amount of floating shares to help maintain its inclusion in the benchmark. Salinas controls nearly 80% of Elektra’s outstanding shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, and has relied on that holding to borrow money and support the extravagant lifestyle he depicts with his online “Tio Richie,” or Uncle Rich, persona. His stake in the company, which offers everything from appliances to telephones and motorcycles, and also includes branches of Banco Azteca, represents three-quarters of his net worth, the data show. “If you use your budding empire as a personal piggybank, things may eventually turn iffy,” said Diego Ferro, founder of M2M Capital, a New York-based investment firm focusing on emerging markets. Tax Claims Meanwhile, Salinas is facing another potential blow to his wealth. Since last year, the billionaire has been locked in an increasingly heated confrontation with the government over billions of dollars in tax claims. The government alleges that four of his companies owe some 63 billion pesos ($3 billion) in taxes in 17 different cases going back as far as 2008. Salinas has argued that the government is trying to “charge us twice” by not recognizing deductions from losses. After years of court battles, several claims against Elektra are in their final appeals before the Supreme Court, which could rule in the coming months. Even with the share freeze, Salinas’ net worth has fallen 28% this year from $15.6 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. As painful as the financial hit may ultimately be, Legaspy, the CEO at Insight Securities, said there’s one thing he’s certain of when it comes to someone as resilient and deep-pocketed as Salinas: “He’ll survive.” --With assistance from Daniel Cancel.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biden-proposes-medicare-medicaid-coverage-104108202.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 6:48 AM","(Bloomberg) -- The Biden administration is proposing a rule that would require the US government to cover weight-loss drugs, potentially expanding access for millions of Americans with obesity and creating a huge new medical bill for President-elect Donald Trump. Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field NYC's Underground Steam System May Be Key to a Greener Future In Italy’s Motor City, Car-Free Options Are Growing NYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge The Medicare insurance program now pays for drugs like Novo Nordisk A/S’s Ozempic and Eli Lilly & Co.’s Mounjaro for people with health conditions such as diabetes. The new rule would give an estimated 3.4 million older Americans on Medicare, and four million more adults in Medicaid programs for the poor, access to weight-loss treatment, according to the White House. The plan would slash out-of-pocket costs by as much as 95% for the drugs that can carry a price tag of $1,000 a month, according to a White House official. The thinking is that the cost would be offset by the reduced incidence of diabetes, heart conditions and other illnesses tied to obesity. The proposal still needs to go through a formal rule-making process that will take months, meaning it would need to be endorsed by Trump to take effect. The rule isn’t expected to be finalized until April, according to Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Duane Wright. Medicare, which provides coverage to about 52 million older Americans, currently doesn’t pay for drugs like Wegovy and Zepbound for obesity. Just 13 state Medicaid programs cover the the blockbuster weight-loss medications. Coverage for obesity would increase Medicare costs by $25 billion over 10 years, while adding $11 billion in federal Medicaid costs and $4 billion in state costs, a spokesperson for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said. The Trump administration has made reducing government spending a key objective. Listen to the Here’s Why podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen. The proposal is a victory for drugmakers Novo and Lilly, which are just emerging from shortages that have curtailed access to the brand-name medicines for the past two years. The booming market for obesity shots is expected to hit $130 billion by 2030, and both companies have been racing to convince insurers that the drugs are worth paying for. Covering obesity medicines under Medicare and Medicaid “is an important step forward for patients,” Novo said in a statement. If left untreated, obesity can contribute to diseases such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure and high cholesterol, the company said. Lilly said in a statement that it looks forward to “working with the White House, CMS, and the new administration to ensure fair access” to weight-loss drugs. Novo shares rose as much as 4.9% in Copenhagen, and year-to-date the stock is up about 9%. Lilly rose as much as 4.4% in New York, and it’s now up 34% for the year. Both stocks were also bolstered by a major setback for a competing weight-loss shot being developed by Amgen Inc. Trump’s pick to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., said last month that delivering healthy food to the American public could “solve the obesity and diabetes crisis” for a fraction of the cost of covering GLP-1 drugs. Patients and doctors have been advocating for wider access to the drugs, and efforts to remove restrictions on Medicare coverage have been picking up momentum in Congress. Covering the drugs at their current prices won’t be cheap. However, a Congressional Budget Office analysis released last month suggested that semaglutide, the active ingredient in Novo’s Wegovy, Ozempic and Rybelsus, will be included in government price negotiations under the Inflation Reduction Act in 2025, which could help lower costs. The proposed rule for the weight-loss drugs would go into effect at the same time as the program to lower medication costs through price negotiations, the White House official said. In the meantime, Novo and Lilly have been conducting studies to show that the shots have health benefits beyond weight loss, part of their effort to expand insurance coverage. In March, major health insurers began paying for Novo’s Wegovy for some Medicare beneficiaries with heart disease, opening the door for wider access to the medication. Lilly rolled out cheaper, single-use Zepbound vials in August, in part to give Medicare beneficiaries an avenue to receive the drugs. --With assistance from Deirdre Hipwell, Naomi Kresge and John Tozzi.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/canadian-officials-blast-trumps-tariff-174649878.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 9:46 AM","TORONTO (AP) — Some Canadian officials on Tuesday blasted President-elect Donald's Trump's threat to impose sweeping tariffs, as the leader of the country's most populous province called Trump's comparison of Canada to Mexico “the most insulting thing I’ve ever heard.” Trump has threatened to impose tariffs on products from Canada, Mexico and China as soon as he takes office in January as part of efforts to crack down on illegal immigration and drugs. He said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico as one of his first executive orders. “To compare us to Mexico is the most insulting thing I’ve ever heard from our friends and closest allies, the United States of America,"" Ontario Premier Doug Ford said. “I found his comments unfair. I found them insulting. It’s like a family member stabbing you right in the heart."" Ford said Canada will have no choice but to retaliate. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will convene an emergency meeting with provincial leaders on Wednesday. The Canadian dollar weakened sharply in foreign exchange markets. Trudeau said he spoke with Trump after his threat of tariffs. “We talked about the intense and effective connections between our countries that flow back and forth. We talked about some of the challenges that we can work on together. It was a good call,” Trudeau said. Trump made the threat Monday while railing against an influx of illegal migrants, even though apprehensions at the southern U.S. border have been near four-year lows. Apprehension numbers at the Canadian border pale in comparison. “We shouldn’t confuse the Mexican border with the Canadian border,” Canadian Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne said. The U.S. Border Patrol made 56,530 arrests at the Mexican border in October — and 23,721 arrests at the Canadian one between October 2023 and September 2024. ""It’s the equivalent to a significant weekend at the Mexico border,” Canadian Immigration Minister Marc Miller said, adding that Canada is considering a number of border measures including additional resources. Canada is one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world, and 77% of Canada’s exports go to the U.S. Nearly $3.6 billion Canadian (US$2.7 billion) worth of goods and services cross the border each day. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports are from Canada. Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is investing in for national security. When Trump imposed higher tariffs during his first term, countries responded with retaliatory tariffs. Canada announced billions of new duties in 2018 against the U.S. in response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum. Many of the U.S. products were chosen for their political rather than economic impact. For example, Canada imports just $3 million worth of yogurt from the U.S. annually and most comes from one plant in Wisconsin, the home state of then-Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan. That product was hit with a 10% duty. Now, again, Canadians are particularly worried about auto tariffs because the industry is critical to the economy. The North American auto industry is highly integrated, and parts made in Canada often go to cars manufactured in the U.S. and sold back to Canadians. “To try and undo it with a tariff would be like trying to separate the yolks from the whites in a omelet.

The potential fall of the current government could still drive it sharply higher to 100 basis points, according to Citigroup Inc. strategists. The market nerves reflect investor concerns over Prime Minister Michel Barnier’s ability to pass a budget for next year and enact spending cuts to reduce the country’s deficit. The far-right National Rally party has vowed to bring down his administration with a no-confidence motion if its demands are not met, with the matter likely to come to a head in December. “We could very well come to a situation where the government is again put into jeopardy,” said Greg Hirt, global chief investment officer for multi asset at Allianz Global Investors. “It could well be that we end up with a spread to bunds at the level of Italy.” That would be unprecedented during the era of the euro, given lower-rated Italian bonds are historically among the highest-yielding in the region due to the country’s high debt load. Italian debt trades at a premium of around 125 basis points to Germany, and it would take that kind of level for France to become a longer-term buying opportunity, Hirt said. The concerns over France, sparked in June by President Emmanuel Macron calling a snap election, still pale in comparison with the market panic seen during the region’s debt troubles over a decade ago, when the French bond spread was more than twice as high. There are signs investors are starting to factor in a potential broader crisis, with a credit gauge of the risk that the nation leaves the euro area rising to near its highest level this year. Bank strategists are also sounding fresh warnings. Citigroup said Tuesday that the bond spread may reach 100 basis points quicker than expected, while Commerzbank AG is telling clients to reduce exposure to France. The country’s benchmark stock index has slumped in recent months to underperform peers. “Besides the recent political headlines underscoring that the budget agreement will become difficult and could bring the government down, the macro outlook is also deteriorating quickly,” Christoph Rieger, Commerzbank’s head of rates and credit research, wrote in a note. The country’s central bank chief has called for more certainty around plans to repair the country’s finances. Data last week showed private-sector business activity in France plunged at the quickest rate since the start of the year, a sign that political and geopolitical concerns are weighing on sentiment. France’s finances are about to face scrutiny from S&P Global Ratings on Friday, which could be the next catalyst for market moves, after both Fitch Ratings and Moody’s Ratings gave it a negative outlook last month. Given the lack of a majority, Barnier is widely expected to use a constitutional provision in December known as 49.3 to adopt the bill without putting it to a vote in the National Assembly. But using the tool raises the likelihood of a no-confidence vote that would bring down the government and reject the budget bill. The left has pledged to propose such a ballot, which would pass if Marine Le Pen’s National Rally lawmakers back it. The far-right leader has raised pressure on Barnier in recent days by reiterating that the current budget proposals are unacceptable and bringing down the government would not be a catastrophe. The French premier is due to speak on television news later Tuesday. “I was in France meeting different clients and the bearishness I’ve seen on their own country, from French asset managers, struck me — they’re not buying,” said Amedeo Scippacercola, head of European government bond trading at Mizuho International Plc. --With assistance from William Horobin.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-latest-tariff-plan-aims-162844993.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 8:28 AM","WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump has identified what he sees as an all-purpose fix for what ails America: Slap huge new tariffs on foreign goods entering the United States. On Monday, Trump sent shockwaves across the nation's northern and southern borders, vowing sweeping new tariffs on Mexico, Canada, as well as China, as soon as he takes office as part of his effort to crack down on illegal immigration and drugs. In a pair of posts on his Truth Social site Trump railed against an influx of illegal migrants, even though southern border apprehensions have been hovering near four-year lows. He said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the country from Canada and Mexico, and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China, as one of his first executive orders. He said the new tariffs would remain in place “until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!” The president-elect asserts that tariffs — basically import taxes — will create more factory jobs, shrink the federal deficit, lower food prices and allow the government to subsidize childcare. Economists are generally skeptical, considering tariffs to be a mostly inefficient way for governments to raise money. They are especially alarmed by Trump’s latest proposed tariffs. Carl B. Weinberg and Rubeela Farooqi, economists with High Frequency Economics said Tuesday that energy, automobiles and food supplies will be particularly hit hard. “Imposing tariffs on trade flows into the United States without first preparing alternative sources for the goods and services affected will raise the price of imported items at once,"" Weinberg and Farooqi wrote. ""Since many of these goods are consumer goods, households will be made poorer.” High Frequency Economics believes the threats are not meant to support new trade policy and are instead a tool to elicit some changes along the borders and for imports from Canada, Mexico and China. Though Vice President Kamala Harris criticized Trump’s tariff threats as unserious during her failed bid for the presidency, the Biden-Harris administration retained the taxes the Trump administration imposed on $360 billion in Chinese goods. And it imposed a 100% tariff on Chinese electric vehicles. Indeed, the United States in recent years has gradually retreated from its post-World War II role of promoting global free trade and lower tariffs. That shift has been a response to the loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs, widely attributed to unfettered trade and an increasingly aggressive China. Tariffs are a tax on imports They are typically charged as a percentage of the price a buyer pays a foreign seller. In the United States, tariffs are collected by Customs and Border Protection agents at 328 ports of entry across the country. The tariff rates range from passenger cars (2.5%) to golf shoes (6%). Tariffs can be lower for countries with which the United States has trade agreements. For example, most goods can move among the United States, Mexico and Canada tariff-free because of Trump’s US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement. There's much misinformation about who actually pays tariffs Trump insists that tariffs are paid for by foreign countries. In fact, its is importers — American companies — that pay tariffs, and the money goes to U.S. Treasury. Those companies, in turn, typically pass their higher costs on to their customers in the form of higher prices. That's why economists say consumers usually end up footing the bill for tariffs. Still, tariffs can hurt foreign countries by making their products pricier and harder to sell abroad. Yang Zhou, an economist at Shanghai’s Fudan University, concluded in a study that Trump’s tariffs on Chinese goods inflicted more than three times as much damage to the Chinese economy as they did to the U.S. economy Tariffs are intended mainly to protect domestic industries By raising the price of imports, tariffs can protect home-grown manufacturers. They may also serve to punish foreign countries for committing unfair trade practices, like subsidizing their exporters or dumping products at unfairly low prices. Before the federal income tax was established in 1913, tariffs were a major revenue driver for the government. From 1790 to 1860, tariffs accounted for 90% of federal revenue, according to Douglas Irwin, a Dartmouth College economist who has studied the history of trade policy. Tariffs fell out of favor as global trade grew after World War II. The government needed vastly bigger revenue streams to finance its operations. In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, the government is expected to collect $81.4 billion in tariffs and fees. That's a trifle next to the $2.5 trillion that's expected to come from individual income taxes and the $1.7 trillion from Social Security and Medicare taxes. Still, Trump wants to enact a budget policy that resembles what was in place in the 19th century. He has argued that tariffs on farm imports could lower food prices by aiding America’s farmers. In fact, tariffs on imported food products would almost certainly send grocery prices up by reducing choices for consumers and competition for American producers. Tariffs can also be used to pressure other countries on issues that may or may not be related to trade. In 2019, for example, Trump used the threat of tariffs as leverage to persuade Mexico to crack down on waves of Central American migrants crossing Mexican territory on their way to the United States. Trump even sees tariffs as a way to prevent wars. “I can do it with a phone call,’’ he said at an August rally in North Carolina. If another country tries to start a war, he said he’d issue a threat: “We’re going to charge you 100% tariffs. And all of a sudden, the president or prime minister or dictator or whoever the hell is running the country says to me, ‘Sir, we won’t go to war.’ ” Economists generally consider tariffs self-defeating Tariffs raise costs for companies and consumers that rely on imports. They're also likely to provoke retaliation. The European Union, for example, punched back against Trump’s tariffs on steel and aluminum by taxing U.S. products, from bourbon to Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Likewise, China responded to Trump’s trade war by slapping tariffs on American goods, including soybeans and pork in a calculated drive to hurt his supporters in farm country. A study by economists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, the University of Zurich, Harvard and the World Bank concluded that Trump’s tariffs failed to restore jobs to the American heartland. The tariffs “neither raised nor lowered U.S. employment’’ where they were supposed to protect jobs, the study found. Despite Trump’s 2018 taxes on imported steel, for example, the number of jobs at U.S. steel plants barely budged: They remained right around 140,000. By comparison, Walmart alone employs 1.6 million people in the United States. Worse, the retaliatory taxes imposed by China and other nations on U.S. goods had “negative employment impacts,’’ especially for farmers, the study found. These retaliatory tariffs were only partly offset by billions in government aid that Trump doled out to farmers. The Trump tariffs also damaged companies that relied on targeted imports. If Trump’s trade war fizzled as policy, though, it succeeded as politics. The study found that support for Trump and Republican congressional candidates rose in areas most exposed to the import tariffs — the industrial Midwest and manufacturing-heavy Southern states like North Carolina and Tennessee.","WASHINGTON (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump identified what he as an all-purpose fix for what America: Slap huge new tariffs on foreign goods United States.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/musk-uses-x-push-preferred-172030989.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 9:20 AM","By Helen Coster and Alexandra Ulmer (Reuters) - Billionaire Elon Musk has been using his social media platform X to go to bat for President-elect Donald Trump's cabinet picks and promote his own preferred candidates, advocating for choices he views as change agents who will help remake the U.S. government. In several high-profile cases, however, Musk backed people who either lost out on the roles or withdrew from consideration, suggesting some early limits to the Republican mega donor's influence even as he has emerged as one of Trump's most powerful allies. Musk, who has 206 million followers on X, posted or reposted about Trump's cabinet picks more than 70 times between Nov. 7 and Nov. 20, a Reuters review found. Though the posts represented just a fraction of his more than 2,000 posts during that period, Musk in many cases used them to give attention to Trump's most controversial choices, including former Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard for U.S. intelligence chief and environmental activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr to lead the top U.S. health agency. Musk most enthusiastically rallied support for Matt Gaetz, the former congressman Trump initially tapped to be his attorney general. In the days following Gaetz's Nov. 13 nomination, Musk posted 37 times about Gaetz or his wife Ginger, mostly in positive terms. That was far more than his posts about Trump's other appointments. Gaetz backed out of consideration on Nov. 21, saying his candidacy had become a distraction for Trump amid allegations of sexual misconduct and illicit drug abuse. He has denied wrongdoing. For Trump's Treasury secretary, Musk pushed for Wall Street financier Howard Lutnick over hedge fund manager Scott Bessent, whom Musk dismissed as ""a business-as-usual choice."" Bessent got the job anyway. And in a separate fight over Senate leadership, Musk's endorsed candidate also came up short. One Trump ally said those misses showed the limitations of Musk's sway. Musk's reach on X ""doesn’t mean he’s an effective advocate for his positions or chosen cabinet members,"" the Trump ally said. ""He's still learning how to operate in politics."" Spokespeople for X and Musk did not respond to Reuters requests for comment for this story. Musk, who owns X and rocket company SpaceX and is chief executive of the electric car company Tesla Inc., poured at least $119 million into getting Trump elected and has been a near-constant fixture at Trump's Florida residence, Mar-a-Lago, since his election victory earlier this month. The two men attended an Ultimate Fighting Championship event in New York and a SpaceX launch in Texas, and Musk traveled with Trump to Washington for his meeting with President Joe Biden. On Saturday, Musk reposted a photo that showed him sitting with Trump, Lutnick and Republican Senator Joni Ernst at Mar-a-Lago, where they were discussing cabinet nominees, according to the caption. ""Elon Musk and President Trump are great friends and brilliant leaders working together to Make America Great Again. Elon Musk is a once in a generation business leader and our federal bureaucracy will certainly benefit from his ideas and efficiency,"" said Brian Hughes, a spokesperson for the Trump transition team. Musk's close proximity to Trump has prompted some hand-wringing and complaints from the transition team, who were not accustomed to him being around so much, according to two sources close to Trump staff. Amid increased scrutiny of his unusual role, Musk wrote in a post on X on Nov. 20 that while he had offered his opinion on some candidates, he was not in charge. ""Many selections occur without my knowledge and decisions are 100% that of the President,"" Musk said. EFFICIENCY AND EMOJIS Musk's political posts on X far outnumbered those he used to promote his three businesses, the Reuters review found. He frequently mocks liberals and posts about government waste and Trump's newly created government efficiency panel, which the president-elect tapped Musk and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy to lead. Musk's typical posts consist either of an emoji or a short response to other posts. ""Exactly,"" he wrote on Nov. 14, in response to a post noting that Trump's cabinet picks were ""young outsiders"" who ""skipped the line."" He responded with “Awesome” and a smile emoji on Nov. 13 to a post that said: “They put Tulsi Gabbard on a terror watchlist. Now she’s Director of National Intelligence. The biggest ‘F you’ to the Deep State Swamp.” On Nov. 16, as questions swirled about who Trump would pick for his Treasury secretary, Musk wrote on X that Bessent was ""a business-as-usual choice,"" while Lutnick would ""actually enact change."" Musk also lobbied against Bessent internally, two sources close to Trump said. His efforts fell flat. On Nov. 22, Trump tapped Bessent for the job. Earlier in the month, Musk threw his support behind Republican Senator Rick Scott for Senate majority leader. Trump chose not to weigh in, and Scott ultimately lost to Senator John Thune for the position. One source close to Musk was struck by Musk's willingness to stick with Trump even after he’s been “shut down a couple of times” by the president-elect. ""That’s very rare for a billionaire,"" the source said. ""In general when they don’t get what they want, they walk away."" The source said Musk was committed to Trump's government efficiency efforts. ""He's really focused on the goal,"" the source said. Another test of Musk's influence lies ahead. Since the election, he has posted six times in support of Trump loyalist Kash Patel running the FBI. Patel, who served on Trump's National Security Council during his first term, has promised to go after politicians and journalists perceived to be enemies of Trump. Musk's X posts make clear that he sees Patel as the best option for change and reform. On Nov. 14, Musk posted a “100%” emoji in response to a clip of Patel saying that he would shut down the FBI’s headquarters on day one of Trump's new administration and reopen it as a “Deep State Museum,” with the caption “Make him FBI director.” (Reporting by Helen Coster in New York and Alexandra Ulmer in San Francisco; Additional reporting by Ned Parker; Editing by Colleen Jenkins and Alistair Bell)","By Helen and Alexandra Ulmer (Reuters) - Billionaire Elon Musk has using his social media platform X to go to bat for President-elect Donald cabinet and promote his own preferred candidates, for he views as change agents who help remake the U.S. In high-profile cases, however, Musk backed people who either out roles or withdrew suggesting early limits to the Republican mega donor's influence even he emerged as of most powerful has 206 million followers X, or Trump's more than 70 times Nov. 7 and Nov. 20, a Reuters review Though the represented just fraction than 2,000 during that period, in cases used them give to Trump's controversial choices, including former Democratic congresswoman Gabbard for U.S. intelligence chief and activist Robert F.

Investors in the country’s bonds can tender their holdings for new international bonds. The haircut on the nominal amount of existing bonds is 27%, according to a statement released when the two sides reached an agreement in principle. A creditor committee holding about 40% of the bonds said in a separate press release it supports the offer. Tuesday’s announcement is a milestone in Sri Lanka’s efforts to overhaul its debt after the country defaulted in 2022, as it helps restoring access to international markets. Last week, the Asian nation secured initial approval to receive the next tranche of a $3 billion International Monetary Fund bailout. “I urge private sector creditors to participate in the debt restructuring process to provide essential relief, thereby laying the groundwork for a bright future for Sri Lanka and its people,” President Anura Kumara Dissanayake said in a separate statement. The restructuring could trim as much as $9.5 billion off Sri Lanka’s debt servicing costs over the length of the IMF program, according to the press release. Sri Lanka’s dollar bonds gained on Tuesday, extending their sharp advance of recent weeks. They’ve returned nearly 28% so far this year, outperforming the US-currency debt of other emerging economies, Bloomberg indexes show. Still, with the economy reliant on IMF disbursements, the securities are trading between 63 and 66 per dollar, levels typically considered distressed. The tender offer expires on Dec. 12, with the results announced four days later. Holders with a custodian in Sri Lanka will be offered a separate swap with more favorable terms, according to the statement. Apart from the issuance of so-called macro-linked bonds, whose payouts are linked to economic growth, the deal includes a governance-linked note, which is a novel instrument for a debt rework. The country could get a 75 basis-point coupon reduction on more than $1.5 billion of debt if it meets certain governance targets, including increasing revenue collection. “Governance and a lack of fiscal transparency were root causes of the Sri Lankan debt crisis,” said Samy Muaddi, head of emerging-markets fixed income at T. Rowe Price, which is part of the bondholder group. “This innovative security can be a model for other developing countries.” The security’s structure borrows from another type of ESG debt, known as a sustainability-linked bond. In that case, the goals are environmental, such as reducing emissions of carbon dioxide. ‘Further Tailwind’ The macro-linked bonds are attractive for investors, said Philip McNicholas, Asia sovereign strategist at Robeco Group in Singapore. The IMF may be inclined to be flexible around its program as the government seeks to unwind some fiscal austerity measures to support private consumption and growth, he added. Robeco owns Sri Lankan debt. “A further tailwind may also come from an ongoing post-Covid tourism recovery that could see services exports edge back up toward 10% of gross domestic product and bring in much-needed US dollars to rebuild external buffers and fund the island’s development,” McNicholas said. --With assistance from Anusha Ondaatjie, Matthew Hill, Joanna Ossinger and Ravil Shirodkar.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rivian-gets-6-6-billion-040531401.html,"Mon, Nov 25, 2024, 10:05 PM","By Abhirup Roy SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Rivian said on Monday it has received conditional approval for a loan of up to $6.6 billion from the U.S. Department of Energy to build the electric vehicle maker's production facility in Georgia. Operation of the Georgia plant, where Rivian plans to build future vehicles such as its smaller, less expensive R2 SUVs and R3 crossovers, will begin in 2028, the California-based startup said in a statement. Rivian shares are down about 50% this year as the young company has struggled to produce its roomy electric SUVs and pickup trucks while grappling with a part shortage, and has pushed to slash costs. To conserve cash and hasten the production of R2 - seen critical to Rivian's success amid a slowdown in EV growth - Rivian paused construction of the Georgia plant earlier this year. It instead decided to start building R2 in 2026 at its Normal, Illinois plant where it makes its flagship R1S SUVs and R1T pickup trucks. ""This loan would enable Rivian to more aggressively scale our U.S. manufacturing footprint for our competitively priced R2 and R3 vehicles that emphasize both capability and affordability,"" Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said in the statement. The loan comes from the government's Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing loan program that has previously provided low-cost loans to other automakers, including Tesla, Ford and General Motors. The company had earlier forecast the cost of the Georgia plant at $5 billion. Rivian said it expects the Georgia plant to employ about 7,500 operations staff through 2030. Rivian must satisfy certain technical, legal, environmental, and financial conditions before the energy department grants the loan, said the company. ""Financially supporting the Project will help Rivian bring 400,000 electric vehicles (EVs) to market and into greater use,"" the Department of Energy said in an October assessment as it considered the loan. The loan includes $6 billion of principal and $600 million of capitalized interest. The announcement of the loan comes less than two weeks after Rivian closed its $5.8 billion investment from German automaker Volkswagen as part of their technology joint venture. The joint venture helps alleviate ""a significant chunk of the capital concern"" and likely establish the Rivian and Volkswagen venture as the platform of choice in the Western world apart from Tesla, said Canaccord Genuity analysts in a note at the time. Rivian still faces daunting challenges including a lack of scale, increasing competition, high capital costs and President-elect Donald Trump's plans to end tax credits to buyers of electric vehicles. In 2022, the EV maker had secured a $1.5 billion in state and local incentives for the Georgia facility. In May, it said it had received $827 million in an incentive package from the State of Illinois to expand operations at its Normal facility, where it also makes electric delivery vans for Amazon.com. Rivian earlier this month posted its first drop in quarterly revenue since going public three years ago, citing the significant shortage of a metal part used in the drive unit of its vehicles. Still, the company stuck to its forecast of turning its first gross profit in the current quarter, reflecting cost cuts as Rivian renegotiated supplier contracts and revamped its manufacturing processes, and a sharp increase in green car credits.

The second failure in a row raises concern about the progress of the Epsilon S rocket, whose debut flight is expected by March. The test was conducted inside of the restricted area at Japan’s Tanegashima Space Center in southwestern Japan, and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency is investigating, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters. An Epsilon project manager, Takayuki Imoto, told an online press conference from Tanegashina that the explosion occurred 49 seconds into the planned two-minute test, causing fire and scattering broken parts of the engine and damaging the facility. “We are very sorry to have failed to live up to expectations,” Imoto said. He said the cause of the explosion was still under investigation. Project staff are trying to recover broken pieces to analyze and determine the cause as soon as possible to minimize the delay of the program, Imoto said. He said repairs to the test facility would take several months. Tuesday’s failure comes just over a year after the explosion last year of another Epsilon S engine during a test, according to JAXA. Last year’s explosion was related to damage to the ignition systems of the engine and JAXA has since taken the necessary steps, the agency has said. The triple-stage, 27-meter (88-foot) -long Epsilon S rocket is meant to improve Japan’s position in the growing satellite launch market by using solid fuel for more flexibility and mobility. Japan’s much larger H3 rocket, failed in its debut launch in February 2023 but has since made three consecutive successful flights, most recently earlier in November. “Development of flagship rockets such as Epsilon S is extremely important from the perspective of ensuring autonomy of Japan’s space development,” Hayashi told reporters. “JAXA will thoroughly investigate and take steps.”","TOKYO — The a new flagship small Japanese rocket burst flames Tuesday combustion test, or to the outside but destroying engine and damaging its test facility, said.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morning-bid-treasuries-rally-bessent-114432262.html,"Mon, Nov 25, 2024, 3:44 AM","A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan U.S. Treasury yields slipped back on Monday after Wall Street money manager Scott Bessent got the nod to be the next Treasury Secretary, with markets hoping his take on tax cuts and tariffs may at least be sensitive to edgy investor concerns. Ahead of the Thanksgiving holiday week, President-elect Donald Trump ended intense speculation over the Treasury pick late on Friday and put Bessent forward for the job. While in favor of extending 2017's tax cuts, more tax reform and deregulation, Bessent has been vocal about fiscal control, sees tariff threats mostly as a negotiating tool and supports the dollar's dominant reserve currency status. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal published on Sunday, Bessent said measures would include making Trump's first term tax cuts permanent, as well as eliminating taxes on tips, social-security benefits and overtime pay. Perhaps the biggest relief in debt markets was that his experience as a Wall Street trader would influence his calibration of all those policies if markets got restive. Although he has backed away from the idea since, Bessent did recently advocate undermining the authority of Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell by nominating Powell's successor early and effectively creating a ""shadow"" Fed boss. The upshot on Monday, however, was that 10-year and 30-year Treasury yields fell almost 10 basis points from Friday's close to as low as 4.32% and 4.51% respectively before steadying. The drop in yields, along with hopes for a more tempered approach to tariff hikes from the administration at large, saw the dollar retreat, and stock index futures extended Friday's rally ahead of the Monday's bell. The dollar index fell back from Friday's two-year highs, with the euro recovering ground from its sharp plunge late last week. With speculation that China would remain the focus for any U.S. tariff hike campaign - and proposed universal tariff rises more nuanced - European and Japanese stocks advanced while Chinese mainland and Hong Kong benchmarks fell again on Monday. Whatever happens under Trump, pressure on China is intense already. The outgoing Joe Biden administration is set to unveil new export restrictions on China this week, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce told members. New regulations could add up to 200 Chinese chip companies to a trade restriction list that bars most U.S. suppliers from shipping goods to the targeted firms, an email from the powerful Washington-based lobbying group said. In Europe, rising economic, trade and geopolitical worries were underscored by the Ifo institute's latest German business survey - which showed morale fell more than expected in November. Last week's divergence in euro zone business surveys showing fresh contraction and another robust U.S. reading were stark. Pressure on the European Central Bank to keep easing monetary policy is building and has kept alive hopes of a rate cut of up to 50bps at next month's final policy meeting of the year. Although ECB chief economist Philip Lane said there was still a way to go to ensure inflation is sustainably back at target, he warned of the dangers of overly tight interest rates.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/california-pledges-ev-buyer-rebate-152405490.html,"Mon, Nov 25, 2024, 12:53 PM","(Bloomberg) -- Tesla Inc.’s electric vehicles would be shut out from consumer rebates under a proposal by California Governor Gavin Newsom, pitting the prospective Democratic presidential hopeful against Republican power player Elon Musk. Newsom on Monday unveiled plans to offer rebates to EV buyers if US President-elect Donald Trump repeals a federal subsidy. A program California phased out in 2023 could be rebooted in lieu of the $7,500 tax credit, the governor said. His office told Bloomberg News that the current proposal includes market-share limitations that would exclude Tesla’s popular EV models. The details — including Tesla’s possible omission from the credits — will be negotiated with the state legislature and could change, Newsom’s office said. “It’s about creating the market conditions for more of these car makers to take root,” according to the governor’s office. It wasn’t immediately clear if other automakers would be excluded. Musk, Tesla’s billionaire chief executive officer, posted on his X social-media platform that the proposal was “insane,” citing the automaker’s manufacturing presence in the state. The move would leave market-leading Tesla out of a key incentive program aimed at spurring wider adoption of EVs at a time of slowing growth for all-electric vehicles. Tesla’s models do qualify for the federal credit, which was introduced as part of President Joe Biden’s signature climate bill, the Inflation Reduction Act. Excluding Tesla could burnish Newsom’s standing on the left as he renews a clash with Musk, who has become a member of Trump’s inner circle and accepted a role helping the incoming administration cut government spending. Musk has said he’s fine with federal subsidies going away. “This is a slap in Tesla’s face,” Gene Munster, managing partner of Deepwater Asset Management, said of the California proposal. California Tension Tensions between Musk and Newsom have been strained for years, with the Tesla leader moving the automaker’s headquarters to Texas in 2021, in part citing frustration with California’s politics. Musk had angrily denounced state orders to close Tesla’s Fremont factory during the Covid-19 pandemic, labeling them “fascist” in an earnings call. When Musk announced the headquarters move, Newsom said Tesla owed some of its success to California. Tesla still accounts for more than half of all new EVs sold in California, but its grip on the market is slipping. Tesla’s sales in California fell 12.6% during the first three quarters compared with a year earlier, even as overall electric-vehicle sales in the state rose 1%, according to the California New Car Dealers Association. Tesla made 54.5% of all EVs registered in the state during the first three quarters, a significant drop from 63% during the same period last year. California clashed with Trump frequently on auto emission regulations during the incoming president’s first term, and the state’s leaders have made clear they are now girding for another fight. Newsom already has sought to shield the state’s policies on issues including reproductive rights, climate and immigration from potential threats under a Trump administration. Trump has long criticized the Biden administration’s efforts to subsidize EVs in a bid to boost adoption of cleaner cars. His transition team is now looking to slash fuel-efficiency requirements for new cars and light trucks as part of plans to unwind Biden policies the president-elect has blasted as an “EV mandate,” Bloomberg News reported last week. California, as well as states including Oregon and Colorado, currently are exempt from rules that preempt them from enacting their own emissions standards for new vehicles. More than a dozen states representing more than a third of the US auto market now have formally opted to follow California’s rules. Trump in his first term targeted California’s right to set tougher gas mileage rules than the federal government. He is expected to make another attempt to roll back the California carve out under the 1970 Clean Air Act after taking office in January.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/atos-offered-625-million-assets-073213380.html,"Mon, Nov 25, 2024, 5:40 AM","(Bloomberg) -- The French government offered to buy Atos SE’s advanced computing assets for as much as €625 million ($653 million) after an earlier offer from the state expired. The non-binding bid gives the business an enterprise value of €500 million and may include additional payments based on future earnings, the company said in a statement on Monday. The offer, which expires in May, includes Atos’s artificial intelligence business as well as its supercomputers, which are used by researchers, the nuclear power industry and the military. Those assets generated revenue of about €570 million in 2023, the company said in the statement. Atos, once one of France’s premier technology companies, is selling assets to work its way out of a debt pile that threatened its ability to continue operating. The company is being handed over to its creditors, which are seeking to recoup as much value as possible as they try to streamline the business and restart growth. The advanced computing assets, part of Atos’s Big Data & Security unit, are considered to be of strategic importance to the French state. Atos bonds, which have fallen sharply to just a few of cents on the euro over the past 12 months, barely moved on the news. Its €350 million notes due in Nov. 2028 fell almost half a cent, to around 6.5 cents. Atos said it will also launch a formal sale process for the remaining parts of BDS, including what it calls mission-critical systems and its cybersecurity offering, which together generated about €340 million in revenue in 2023. Potential buyers for those parts will need to be approved by the French government, the French finance ministry said in a separate statement. Earlier this month, Atos agreed to sell its Worldgrid unit to French engineering and tech consultant Alten SA for €270 million, including debt. Atos is a key supplier to major French industries including nuclear facilities and last summer’s Olympic Games in Paris, and the government has monitored its breakup closely, working to keep the most sensitive parts of the business under French control. The state previously bid for the company’s supercomputers in a €700 million proposal that had also included cybersecurity assets from the BDS unit, but that offer expired without a deal. The earlier failed negotiations with the French state were the latest in a string of discussions for Atos assets that fell apart as the company looked for cash to pay off its debts. Atos had a market value of about €80 million as of market close on Friday. Shares rose 105% to €0.32 in Paris on Monday, giving it a market value of about €99 million. Shares will be massively diluted when Atos’s financial restructuring, recently agreed with creditors, completes in the next couple of months. French defense company Thales SA previously said it could be interested in some of the big data and cybersecurity division’s mission-critical assets, though a firm offer hasn’t yet materialized. Airbus SE walked away from a deal to buy the big data and cybersecurity businesses in March. Talks to sell its legacy IT services unit — which started at an initial valuation of €2 billion including debt — to Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky’s EPEI also ended without a deal. Atos’s creditors will take control of the company by January in a deal that will convert €2.9 billion of loans and bonds into equity and new financing. Philippe Salle, who was named Atos’s seventh chief executive officer in about three years, will take over the role from February and will be charged with steering the deals to completion and turning the company around. --With assistance from Bruce Douglas.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-boom-propels-wild-west-130008287.html,"Mon, Nov 25, 2024, 5:00 AM","(Bloomberg) -- A Texas land company founded during the Wild West era more than a century ago is becoming an unlikely beneficiary of market euphoria over artificial intelligence. Dallas-based Texas Pacific Land Corp., which employs 100 people, has seen its stock more than triple this year, giving it a market value of almost $40 billion. That’s bigger than Halliburton Co., the largest oilfield servicer in North America, and asset manager State Street Corp. It’s more than four times the size of American Airlines Group Inc., which is based in nearby Fort Worth and has over 100,000 workers. Bitcoin mines, utility-scale batteries and renewable power are already being built on TPL’s 873,000 acres in West Texas, an area bigger than Yosemite National Park. But that could be just the beginning. The swath of land in the oil-rich Permian Basin, where natural gas costs almost nothing, is an opportunity for tech giants like Google owner Alphabet Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc. to access cheap electricity for energy-hungry servers. TPL’s shares surged 14% Friday on the news that the company would replace Marathon Oil Corp. in the S&P 500. “There’s a lot of conversations taking place within the industry and definitely within TPL” about leasing land to data centers, TPL Chief Executive Officer Tyler Glover said this month in a conference call with investors. “We feel that we’re positioned as well as anyone in West Texas to provide land and water solutions as those opportunities unfold.” AI’s potential to revolutionize how people live, work and play has been the driving force behind the S&P 500 Index’s 50% rise over the past two years. But to realize the real-world profits implied by their stock valuations, Big Tech is plowing money into physical infrastructure. Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc. are expected to spend more than $200 billion next year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, much of it on data centers. “A lot of different sectors will be on the receiving end of that,” said Greg Halter, who helps manage $4 billion as director of research at Carnegie Investment Counsel. “You have these oddball entities being revived because all of a sudden they have something valuable.” A spokesperson for TPL declined to comment. The company’s shares have jumped 230% this year to trade at $1,730 on Friday. The high-tech rally is a long way from TPL’s roots as a trust founded in 1888 to repay bondholders who financed a failed attempt to build a railway from East Texas to San Diego during westward expansion. The trust gained 3.5 million acres, an area the size of Connecticut, and slowly sold them off to repay creditors over the following century. But land in the dry, sparsely populated western part of the Permian Basin proved hardest to sell. The acreage turned out to be a multibillion-dollar stroke of good fortune. As the shale revolution took off in the 2000s, that land — and the associated mineral rights — became incredibly valuable. TPL now receives nearly $100 million a quarter in royalties from oil producers like Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and ConocoPhillips while paying nothing toward the cost of their wells. It earned a further $80 million from water sales and fees for companies using its land in the most recent quarter, contributing to an 83% profit margin. At least one other Texas landowner has gotten a boost from investor enthusiasm about AI. LandBridge Co., which owns about 220,000 acres in the Permian, has surged more than threefold since its initial public offering in June. The company agreed to buy more land this month in a deal that would expand its acreage by 20%, citing the potential for “digital infrastructure and renewable energy projects.” Along with TPL and LandBridge, utility and power stocks are some of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI surge, with Vistra Corp, GE Vernova Inc. and Constellation Energy Corp. all in the top 10 S&P 500 performers this year. Pipelines, which provide gas to power plants, are also flying. Kinder Morgan Inc., Oneok Inc. and Targa Resources Corp. are all up more than 50% this year. “This is the AI-adjacent pick and shovel trade,” said Kevin Simpson, who helps manage $11 billion, including TPL shares, as chief executive officer of Capital Wealth Planning LLC. “These are not obscene valuations if the data center thesis plays out.” Now investors are thinking further ahead. With a ChatGPT query using nearly ten times as much electricity as a Google search, US data center power demand is expected to grow about 170% by 2030, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc. “This increased demand will help drive the kind of electricity growth that hasn’t been seen in a generation,” the bank said in May. Sam Altman, founder of ChatGPT owner OpenAI, has pitched the idea of five-gigawatt centers. That could require millions of square feet of space and enough energy to light up many US cities. There’s concern that the electricity needs of data centers will put climate goals at risk as companies turn to fossil fuels to power them. The Permian appears well placed to fill at least some of the energy demand. The basin produces enormous quantities of natural gas as byproduct of oil, filling pipelines to capacity. Much of the excess is burned into the atmosphere in a process known as flaring. Gas at the basin's Waha hub traded for 96% less than the US benchmark on average over the past year, and Permian gas prices actually went negative more than once this year as producers paid for the fuel to be taken off their hands. Momentum is now gathering behind the idea that this cheap, abundant gas could be used for power plants, which in turn could supply energy to data centers, crypto mines and the oil field. Still, the market for some AI-adjacent stocks may be getting frothy, at least in the near term. Capital Wealth Planning’s Simpson said he recently trimmed his position in TPL by a third after the stock soared 40% in a month. It’s too soon to say whether the TPL’s land will soon be home to sprawling data centers, according to CEO Glover. But the company is in prime position to benefit from AI’s expansion, he said. “TPL just has a lot of positive attributes for data centers,” he said. “Nobody has more land than us in West Texas.” --With assistance from Dave Merrill and Josh Saul.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-arguments-draw-skepticism-judge-210948215.html,"Mon, Nov 25, 2024, 3:12 PM","(Bloomberg) -- A federal judge threw cold water on one of Alphabet Inc.’s key arguments in a Department of Justice lawsuit over allegations that Google monopolized advertising technology. During closing arguments in the lawsuit against the tech giant, US District Judge Leonie Brinkema said that she disagreed with Google’s attempts to rely on an earlier antitrust case involving American Express Co. The judge interrupted Google’s lawyer Monday to say that she had carefully studied a 2018 Supreme Court decision in the older case. “We’re dealing with a completely different setup” here compared to Amex, she said on the closing day of the trial in Alexandria, Virginia. The case is one of several against Google over antitrust issues. In another, the Justice Department is seeking to force Alphabet to sell off its Chrome browser after winning a landmark ruling that company illegally monopolized online search. In Monday’s case, the Justice Department and a group of states sued Google in 2023, arguing the company illegally monopolized three separate markets for advertising technology: sell-side tools used by websites, called ad servers; advertising exchanges; and buy-side tools used by advertisers known as ad networks. The company has countered by saying that splitting its tools into those buckets is wrong and its business is better understood as a single market in which website publishers and advertisers transact. Brinkema’s interjection came as Google lawyers were citing the American Express case, where the Supreme Court ruled that judges should look at how a product or service impacts different groups of customers. Google argues that some of its conduct — which the Justice Department said harmed website publishers — can be justified because it was intended to help advertisers. Brinkema said she has “problems” applying the ruling related to the credit card market to Google. But Google’s lawyer, Karen Dunn, argued that the company’s ad tech tools serve a similar function to credit cards by seeking to “match” buyers and sellers of online ads. The tools act to “facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers,” she said. You “can’t look at one side in isolation.” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Justin Teresi, who attended Monday’s arguments, said he believes Brinkema will rule in favor of the government based on a different legal argument. “A liability finding is likely on some claims — most notably those involving the publisher ad server and tying,” said Teresi, who focuses on antitrust litigation and policy. The Justice Department argued Monday that the Amex decision only applies to credit card transaction platforms, not all markets where a company does business with two sets of customers. For example, courts haven’t held that for newspapers, which sell ads to advertisers and news to consumers. “Google is once, twice, three times a monopolist,” Justice Department lawyer Aaron Teitelbaum said. The company’s “internal documents make clear it’s three markets and not one.” Google’s Dunn said that US antitrust law allows the company to decide whether to make its products work with that of competitors. Forcing Google to provide technology and resources to make ad tech work seamlessly with rival tools would stifle innovation, she said. Brinkema, who has previously said she plans to issue a decision by the end of the year, didn’t give an update on timing. (Updates with additional details on argument beginning in eighth paragraph.)

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/starbucks-using-pens-paper-track-204802998.html,"Mon, Nov 25, 2024, 2:46 PM","(Bloomberg) -- Starbucks Corp. said a ransomware attack at a third-party software supplier has disrupted its system for tracking employee schedules, forcing the coffee giant to manually tally workers’ hours and pay. Blue Yonder Group Inc., a Panasonic subsidiary that provides supply chain management software, said its systems were disrupted by a Nov. 21 “ransomware incident.” Starbucks is among its customers and uses Blue Yonder software to schedule shifts and track retail workers’ hours in North America, a company spokesperson said. Starbucks’ stores are resorting to manual methods such as pen and paper for employee scheduling, the spokesperson said, adding that the incident hasn’t impacted store operations or hours. The Blue Yonder breach is affecting company-operated stores in the US and Canada. In a message to workers seen by Bloomberg News, Starbucks said that Blue Yonder hasn’t provided a timeline for when the issue may be resolved. To ensure workers get paid on Nov. 29, they’ll get compensated for scheduled shifts for the week of Nov. 18. That might differ from actual hours worked, since staffers might have picked up extra shifts or taken vacation or sick time that wasn’t entered into the system. “We are hopeful this outage will not extend to impact payroll processing for future weeks,” the company said in the update to workers. “However, we are continuing to look for ways to improve pay accuracy and processing should the outage continue.” In another message, Starbucks shared a template to help managers build schedules for the week of Dec. 9. The company usually creates schedules three weeks in advance. Ransomware Incident In a statement Monday, Blue Yonder said it had notified relevant customers about the incident and “will continue to communicate as appropriate.” “Blue Yonder experienced disruptions to its managed services hosted environment, which was determined to be the result of a ransomware incident,” said Marina Renneke, a company spokesperson. “Since learning of the incident, the Blue Yonder team has been working diligently together with external cybersecurity firms to make progress in their recovery process. We have implemented several defensive and forensic protocols.” The attack was previously reported by CNN, which said some UK grocery store chains had taken steps to deal with the incident. A representative for the UK grocery chain Morrisons told Bloomberg News on Monday that the Blue Yonder breach had impacted warehouse management systems but added that the stores are now operating “satisfactorily” on back-up systems. Sainsbury’s confirmed the company used Blue Yonder but said it wasn’t experiencing disruptions because it had a back-up solution. An Asda spokesperson said the company used Blue Yonder but was unaffected.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/playai-clones-voices-command-120045473.html,"Mon, Nov 25, 2024, 7:16 PM","Back in 2016, Hammad Syed and Mahmoud Felfel, an ex-WhatsApp engineer, thought it'd be neat to build a text-to-speech Chrome extension for Medium articles. The extension, which could read any Medium story aloud, was featured on Product Hunt. A year later, it spawned an entire business. ""We saw a bigger opportunity in helping individuals and organizations create realistic audio content for their applications,"" Syed told TechCrunch. ""Without the need to build their own model, they could deploy human-quality speech experiences faster than ever before."" Syed and Felfel's company, PlayAI (formerly PlayHT), pitches itself as the ""voice interface of AI."" Customers can choose from a number of predefined voices, or clone a voice, and use PlayAI's API to integrate text-to-speech into their apps. Toggles allow users to adjust the intonation, cadence, and tenor of voices. PlayAI also offers a ""playground"" where users can upload a file to generate a read-aloud version and a dashboard for creating more-polished audio narrations and voice-overs. Recently, the company got into the ""AI agents"" game with tools that can be used to automate tasks such as answering customer calls at a business. One of PlayAI's more interesting experiments is PlayNote, which transforms PDFs, videos, photos, songs, and other files into podcast-style shows, read-aloud summaries, one-on-one debates, and even children's stories. Like Google's NotebookLM, PlayNote generates a script from an uploaded file or URL and feeds it to a collection of AI models, which together craft the finished product. I gave it a whirl, and the results weren't half bad. PlayNote's ""podcast"" setting produces clips more or less on par with NotebookLM's in terms of quality, and the tool's ability to ingest photos and videos makes for some fascinating creations. Given a picture of a chicken mole dish I had recently, PlayNote wrote a five-minute podcast script about it. Truly, we are living in the future. Granted, the tool, like all AI tools, generates odd artifacts and hallucinations from time to time. And while PlayNote will do its best to adapt a file to the format you've chosen, don't expect, say, a dry legal filing to make for the best source material. See: the Musk vs. OpenAI lawsuit framed as a bedtime story: PlayNote's podcast format is made possible by PlayAI's latest model, PlayDialog, which Syed says can use the ""context and history"" of a conversation to generate speech that reflects the conversation flow. ""Using a conversation’s historical context to control prosody, emotion, and pacing, PlayDialog delivers conversation with natural delivery and appropriate tone,"" he continued. PlayAI, which is close rivals with ElevenLabs, has been criticized in the past for its laissez-faire approach to safety. The company's voice cloning tool requires that users check a box indicating that they ""have all the necessary rights or consent"" to clone a voice — but there isn't any enforcement mechanism. I had no trouble creating a clone of Kamala Harris' voice from a recording. That's concerning considering the potential for scams and deepfakes. PlayAI also claims that it automatically detects and blocks ""sexual, offensive, racist, or threatening content."" But that wasn't the case in my testing. I used the Harris clone to generate speech I frankly can't embed here and never once saw a warning message. Meanwhile, PlayNote's community portal, which is filled with publicly generated content, has files with explicit titles like ""Woman Performing Oral Sex."" Syed tells me that PlayAI responds to reports of voices cloned without consent, like this one, by blocking the user responsible and removing the cloned voice immediately. He also makes the case that PlayAI's highest-fidelity voice clones, which require 20 minutes of voice samples, are priced higher ($49 per month billed annually or $99 per month) than most scammers are willing to pay. ""PlayAI has several ethical safeguards in place,"" Syed said. ""We've implemented robust mechanisms to identify whether a voice was synthesized using our technology, for example. If any misuse is reported, we promptly verify the origin of the content and take decisive actions to rectify the situation and prevent further ethical violations."" I'd certainly hope that's the case — and that PlayAI moves away from marketing campaigns featuring dead tech celebrities. If PlayAI's moderation isn't robust, it could face legal challenges in Tennessee, which has a law on the books preventing platforms from hosting AI to make unauthorized recordings of a person's voice. PlayAI's approach to training its voice-cloning AI is also a bit murky. The company won't reveal where it sourced the data for its models, ostensibly for competitive reasons. ""PlayAI uses mostly open datasets, [as well as licensed data] and proprietary datasets that are built in-house,"" Syed said. ""We don’t use user data from the products in training, or creators to train models. Our models are trained on millions of hours of real-life human speech, delivering voices in male and female genders across multiple languages and accents."" Most AI models are trained on public web data — some of which may be copyrighted or under a restrictive license. Many AI vendors argue that the fair-use doctrine shields them from copyright claims. But that hasn’t stopped data owners from filing class action lawsuits alleging that vendors used their data sans permission. PlayAI hasn't been sued. However, its terms of service suggest it won't go to bat for users if they find themselves under legal threat. Voice cloning platforms like PlayAI face criticism from actors who fear that voice work will eventually be replaced by AI-generated vocals and that actors will have little control over how their digital doubles are used. The Hollywood actors' union SAG-AFTRA has struck deals with some startups, including online talent marketplace Narrativ and Replica Studios, for what it describes as ""fair"" and ""ethical"" voice cloning arrangements. But even these tie-ups have come under intense scrutiny, including from SAG-AFTRA's own members. In California, laws require companies relying on a performer’s digital replica (e.g., cloned voice) give a description of the replica’s intended use and negotiate with the performer’s legal counsel. They also require that entertainment employers gain the consent of a deceased performer’s estate before using a digital clone of that person. Syed says that PlayAI ""guarantees"" that every voice clone generated through its platform is exclusive to the creator. ""This exclusivity is vital for protecting the creative rights of users,"" he added. The increasing legal burden is one headwind for PlayAI. Another is the competition. Papercup, Deepdub, Acapela, Respeecher, and Voice.ai, as well as Big Tech incumbents Amazon, Microsoft, and Google, offer AI dubbing and voice-cloning tools. The aforementioned ElevenLabs, one of the highest-profile voice-cloning vendors, is said to be raising new funds at a valuation over $3 billion. PlayAI isn't struggling to find investors, though. This month, the Y Combinator-backed company closed a $21 million seed round co-led by 500 Startups and Kindred Ventures with participation from Race Capital, 500 Global, and Soma Capital. ""The new capital will be used to invest in our generative AI voice models and voice agent platform, and to shorten the time for businesses to build human-quality speech experiences,"" Syed said, adding that PlayAI plans to expand its 40-person workforce.","Back 2016, Hammad and Felfel, an engineer, thought it'd neat to build a text-to-speech Chrome extension Medium extension, could read Medium story aloud, was Product later, spawned an entire business. a in helping individuals and organizations create realistic content for Syed told TechCrunch. need to build could speech experiences than ever before."" and PlayAI (formerly as interface AI."" can choose from a number of voices, or a and PlayAI's integrate text-to-speech into their apps.

Mass production of the chip designed in-house is expected to begin in 2025, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be named discussing a private corporate plan. The 2025 timeframe underscores how Xiaomi’s keen to join a growing number of tech majors investing in semiconductors, a key focus for Beijing in a broader tech race with the US. Chinese officials have also repeatedly asked local firms to reduce their reliance on overseas tech as much as possible, and Xiaomi’s move is likely to help with that goal. For the Beijing-based company, it marks a foray into yet another cutting-edge field, in a year where Xiaomi also invested heavily in electric vehicles. Breaking through in the smartphone chip arena is no easy task. Intel Corp. and Nvidia Corp. failed to compete effectively, as did Xiaomi’s rival Oppo. Only Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google have successfully transitioned their full range of devices to self-designed silicon — with even industry leader Samsung Electronics Co. relying heavily on Qualcomm’s chips due to their better efficiency and mobile connectivity. For Xiaomi, developing in-house chipmaking expertise can help the company’s efforts toward making smarter and better connected EVs, above and beyond more competitive mobile devices.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/meta-tiktok-google-slam-australia-232314894.html,"Mon, Nov 25, 2024, 3:23 PM","(Bloomberg) -- Global tech giants including Meta, TikTok and Google have heavily criticized Australian legislation to ban children under 16 from accessing social media platforms, setting the stage for a policy fight as the government tries to push the bill through parliament this week. Under the proposed law, Australians under 16 years of age will be prohibited from setting up accounts on all major social media sites including Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Reddit, even if they obtain parental permission. The social media giants will be responsible for policing the ban, under threat of fines of up to A$50 million ($32.5 million). The center-left Labor government has not laid out how proposed age verification technology will work, although Communication Minister Michelle Rowland told her parliamentary colleagues last week that it would not involve uploading personal identification. Subscribe to The Bloomberg Australia Podcast on Apple, Spotify, on YouTube, or wherever you listen. The Australian Senate, or upper house of parliament, is holding a short inquiry into the legislation which is due to report by Tuesday; however, given the legislation has support from the center-right opposition it is all but certain to become law within days. In submissions to the Senate inquiry, tech companies warned of unintended, negative consequences from the rapidly-drafted laws. TikTok ANZ’s Director of Public Policy Ella Woods-Joyce described the legislation as “rushed” and “unworkable” in her submission, pointing to poor privacy safeguards. Meta said the social media ban “overlooks the practical reality of age assurance technology.” Both Meta and Google said it was important for Australia to wait until a national trial of age verification technology was completed before passing the bill. “In the absence of such results, neither industry nor Australians will understand the nature or scale of age assurance required by the Bill nor the impact of such measures on Australians,” Meta said in its submission. At the same time, Elon Musk’s X Corp said the bill was “alarming,” adding that it had “serious concerns as to the lawfulness of the bill,” potentially setting up a court challenge to the legislation. “There is no evidence that banning young people from social media will work, and to make it law in the form proposed is highly problematic,” X said in a submission to the committee, adding that the bill was “vague.” Musk’s social media site, formally known as Twitter, has already taken the Australian government to court multiple times over its attempts to rein in social media. Almost all tech companies warned that the laws could also damage the mental health of young Australians if they were rushed through, by cutting off vulnerable teenagers from online community support networks.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-chief-returns-china-beijing-025800892.html,"Mon, Nov 25, 2024, 5:34 AM","(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook joined more than 20 corporate leaders in discussions with China’s premier Monday, as global companies grapple with potential trade disruptions and economic uncertainty. Cook, who’s visiting the country for at least the third time this year, joined top executives of global firms including Rio Tinto Plc, Corning Inc. and Charoen Pokphand Group in a meeting with Li Qiang, state media reported. Chinese corporate chiefs including the heads of Lenovo Group and ICBC also attended the event, which discussed supply chain and trade issues. The meeting, in which about two dozen executives took part, marked the first high-level meeting between foreign corporations and a senior Beijing official since Donald Trump won a second four-year term. Companies worldwide are bracing for the president-elect’s threat to hike tariffs on Chinese goods. The gathering of business leaders, which took place before a supply chain expo in Beijing starting Tuesday, was earlier reported by Bloomberg News. It went on for over an hour and felt pretty scripted, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified discussing a private event. Li, at one point, quoted Adam Smith’s view that the propensity to truck, barter and exchange was inherent in human nature, the people said. Li also told the executives to send any feedback to him, saying he would take it seriously, one of the people said. The premier didn’t mention Trump or tariffs, another person said. In a separate report by the official Xinhua News Agency, Li said Beijing is against decoupling and urged efforts to maintain the stability of the global supply chain. He also vowed to continue developing the Chinese economy. Disruptions to trade are a source of concern especially for Apple, which makes the majority of its iPhones through Foxconn in the country and counts China as its biggest market after the US. The Apple CEO was in the capital just last month, when he promised to keep investing in the country and also underscored its vital role in the iPhone maker’s global operations. Cook on Monday made it a point to emphasize the importance of the Chinese supply chain during brief remarks carried by a social media account linked to state broadcaster China Central Television. “I value them very highly. We could not do what we do without them,” Cook said in response to a question about Apple’s Chinese partners. Beijing this year has taken a more active role in encouraging foreign investment, as the economy remains mired in a post-Covid funk. AmCham China — represented by President Michael Hart at the meeting with Li — said the discussions focused on opportunities to strengthen supply chain resilience and expand bilateral and multilateral engagement. This is the first time that AmCham China has met with a Chinese premier since May 2022. Li last held a roundtable with foreign business executives ahead of the China International Import Expo in Shanghai earlier this month. Since Trump’s election victory, he has picked several China hawks for top posts in his new administration. Also present at the meeting were Thai billionaire Dhanin Chearavanont, Sumitomo Electric Industries Ltd. Chairman Matsumoto Masayoshi, Robin Zeng of Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., and Li Dongsheng, the chairman of TCL Technology Group Corp.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microstrategy-accelerates-bitcoin-buying-record-141347474.html,"Mon, Nov 25, 2024, 6:13 AM","(Bloomberg) -- MicroStrategy Inc. bought a record $5.4 billion in Bitcoin, the third major purchase announced this month by the crypto hedge fund proxy. Using the proceeds from a $3 billion convertible note issue and common share sales, the Tysons Corner, Virginia-based firm acquired 55,500 tokens from Nov. 18 through Nov. 24, according to an US Securities and Exchange Commission filing. MicroStrategy now owns around $38 billion in Bitcoin, making it the largest publicly traded corporate holder of the digital asset. MicroStrategy co-founder and Chairman Michael Saylor has captured the attention of Wall Street by turning the enterprise software maker into what he calls a “Bitcoin Treasury” company. The firm’s shares have surged more than 500% this year, outperforming almost every other major stock. If treated like cash, the $38 billion is more than the cash and marketable securities held by all but about a dozen companies in the S&P 500 Index. After initially funding the purchases with corporate cash when he started buying Bitcoin in 2020, Saylor has devised a program where the firm sells convertible debt and additional shares. Lenders accepted a zero percent interest rate on the latest convertible issue on a bet that the shares will be more valuable in the future than the conversion price. It announced plans last month to raise $42 billion in capital. Saylor “has aptly touched upon this financial arbitrage in the capital structure of a corporate treasury,” said Jeffrey Park, portfolio manager and head of alpha strategies at Bitwise Asset Management. “And essentially what he’s created is the ability to borrow, essentially for free.” MicroStrategy has acquired 386,700 tokens since 2020 for an average purchase price of around 60% of the current value of its holdings. However, MicroStrategy’s purchases announced on Monday happened last week while Bitcoin was near all-time highs. This led to the company purchasing these new tokens for approximately $97,862 per token, roughly below their current value. The leverage strategy has caught the attention of skeptics of the plan last week, with shares of MicroStrategy tumbling 16% on Thursday. If Bitcoin significantly drops, MicroStrategy’s stock risks facing the same fate, which happened in 2022 when the digital asset’s price slumped. “When you apply leverage to anything, you amplify the returns both in the up direction and in the down direction,” TD Cowen analyst Lance Vitanza said. “The only thing that’s novel here is that MicroStrategy is the first company to apply it to Bitcoin.” --With assistance from Muyao Shen and Tom Contiliano.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morning-bid-trump-tariff-threat-111340380.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 3:13 AM","A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan Any speculation that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump would adopt a 'softly, softly' approach to his trade and economic policies was jolted overnight as he warned of immediate tariff hikes on Canada, Mexico and China - hitting the currencies of all three. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, said he would impose a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico on day one until these countries clamp down on drugs, particularly fentanyl, and undocumented migrants crossing the border. The move would appear to violate a free-trade deal with both countries that he negotiated during his first White House term. Trump also separately outlined ""an additional 10% tariff, above any additional tariffs"" on imports from China. It was not entirely clear what this would mean for China as he has previously pledged to end China's most-favoured-nation trading status and slap tariffs on Chinese imports in excess of 60% - much higher than those imposed during his first term. Currency markets quickly adjusted to try account for the risk of these moves in less than two months' time. The U.S. dollar surged more than 1% to a four-and-a-half-year high against its Canadian counterpart and more than 2% against the Mexican peso. And the greenback also rose to its highest since July 30 against China's yuan Together, the peso, Canadian dollar and yuan account for more than 40% of the Federal Reserve's 'broad' dollar trade-weighted basket of currencies. China's embassy in Washington responded to Trump's comments by saying on neither country would win a trade war. Other currencies also fell against the greenback but the moves had moderated by early trading in Europe. The fact that Trump didn't yet mention Europe or Japan as part of the 'day one' plan allowed the euro, which hit a two-year low on Friday, to hold on to Monday's bounce and the yen held up as well. European Central Bank policymaker Mario Centeno warned that the euro zone must be watchful to avoid inflation undershooting ECB's 2% target amid rising economic risks such as likely new U.S. trade tariffs - that are ""not good news for Europe"". TREASURY TRANSITION Trump's barrage of policy pledges on his social media account late on Monday came just as investors had warmed to the nomination of Wall Street money manager Scott Bessent as Treasury Secretary, hoping for a market-savvy influence on the administration and potentially a voice of restraint. News of Bessent's appointment came late on Friday and U.S. Treasury bonds rallied sharply in response, with 10-year and 30-year yields falling 10-20 basis points back to pre-election levels. The retreat in Treasury yields was aided by a fresh swoon in crude oil prices and inflation expectations on reports that Israel look set to approve a U.S. plan for a ceasefire with Lebanon's Hezbollah on Tuesday. The drop in U.S. crude prices back below $70 per barrel was also helped by news that Trump's transition team is planning an energy package that would approve export permits for new liquefied natural gas projects and increase oil drilling off the U.S. coast and on federal lands. And the drop in Treasury yields had pulled the dollar back off two-year highs on Monday, at least until the overnight tariff jolt upset the apple cart again today. Helped by the calm in Treasuries, Wall St stock indexes climbed again on Monday - with the Dow Jones Industrial Average hitting a new record and the small cap Russell 2000 outperforming to hit an all-time high, too. With another heavy diary of Treasury auctions underway in a holiday-shortened week state-side, the speculation around the new administration's direction is pushing more regular economic monitoring to one side for now. The Fed is due to release minutes of its most recent policy meeting - when it cut key interest rates again, just two days after the election. Before that, the Conference Board will also release its latest survey of consumer confidence, another key test of how households reacted to the election result.

Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field NYC's Underground Steam System May Be Key to a Greener Future NYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge The company’s new flagship phone, the Mate 70, will debut HarmonyOS Next, the iteration of its operating system that does away with remnants of Android in favor of entirely indigenous tech. Announced at a live-streamed event on Tuesday, the new devices and software add to Huawei’s campaign to reclaim China’s premium tier from Apple Inc. and build an ecosystem without the involvement of major US tech providers. Available on Dec. 4, the Mate 70 and its Pro variants are the followup to Huawei’s most significant device in years, the Mate 60. Last year’s edition, powered by a made-in-China processor, brought Huawei back into the smartphone industry limelight and signaled its ability to work around US trade curbs designed to cut it off from the most advanced chipmaking. HarmonyOS Next will still need another two to three months to improve its user experience, but the plan is to henceforth use it on upcoming gadgets, said Richard Yu, chairman of Huawei’s consumer business group. The Mate 70 series, priced from 5,499 yuan ($760) for the 6.7-inch edition, will offer 40% better performance than its predecessor, in part because of HarmonyOS Next, the executive said. Yu fell short of disclosing details of the processors that power the phones. Shenzhen-based Huawei is expected to use its latest in-house Kirin chip for the new product line, though its performance increase may be less significant than Qualcomm Inc. and MediaTek Inc.’s top-end offerings, according to a note by Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Charles Shum and Sean Chen. “That suggests the new Huawei phone may struggle to capture the attention of non-Huawei Android users,” they wrote. The rollout is a key part of Huawei’s relentless attempt to break free from years of US sanctions. The company now finds itself unable to advance from the 7nm chipmaking process for its smartphone and artificial intelligence chips until at least 2026. That’s at a time when competitors like Apple are about to move to 2nm technology for mainstream products, Bloomberg News reported. Despite Washington’s blacklisting and technical challenges, Huawei managed to grow sales over the past seven quarters, with the help of an expanding smartphone business. Its shipments recorded four consecutive quarters of at least double-digit growth in China as of September, according to research firm IDC. Huawei on Tuesday also announced a number of other products in its ecosystem, including a new tablet and a 23,999-yuan gold-plated smartwatch. Earlier in the fall, the company introduced the world’s first trifold phone, also powered by chips that were designed in-house.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/northvolt-collapse-countdown-started-bmw-050000526.html,"Mon, Nov 25, 2024, 7:46 AM","(Bloomberg) -- For Northvolt AB, the Swedish startup that became a poster child for Europe’s electric-driving future, the route to collapse started in June when BMW AG canceled a multi-billion-dollar order. Back then, few saw the significance of the move, which effectively started a countdown that would culminate in a Chapter 11 filing less than six months later. Northvolt scrambled to keep the financing flowing, but as Germany’s car industry fell deeper into its own crisis, it became clear orders would dry up. The company responded to the lost revenue by retrenching expansion plans and slashing jobs. By the time the last attempt at an emergency plan failed, investors who had poured in $10 billion discovered only $30 million cash was left. Northvolt’s filing for bankruptcy protection in the US, announced Thursday, marks one of the highest-profile setbacks for European industry against cheaper and nimbler Chinese and South Korean competition. The following day, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Peter Carlsson, who only a year ago had been trumpeting Northvolt as a possible IPO candidate, resigned and warned the European Union risks falling behind on green projects. The company needs as much as $1.2 billion to finance its new business plan, Carlsson said, telling reporters that “we’ll regret it in 20 years if we’re not driving transition” to clean technologies. In addition to BMW and Volkswagen AG, Northvolt’s top investors included Goldman Sachs’s asset management arm, Denmark’s biggest pension fund ATP, Baillie Gifford & Co. funds and a number of Swedish entities. The Financial Times reported on Saturday that funds run by Goldman Sachs Asset Management are set to write down almost $900 million at the end of the year. The investment was a minority one “through highly diversified funds,” Goldman said in an emailed statement, adding that its portfolios “have concentration limits to mitigate risks.” One fund representative, who asked not to be named discussing private matters, said they were shocked at the speed with which Northvolt blew through its billions. As recently as July, the investor was confident of getting a return, but that changed in early August after getting a call from one of Northvolt’s owners, who warned that the battery maker could run out of cash by September. The scale of the delays, and how bad things were with building budgets and construction projects remained hidden, the investor said, recounting how excel models and slide decks were used to conceal how empty the coffers had become. The Swedish company now faces a task of restructuring, with a more focused operation set to emerge from the Chapter 11 process. “A dilemma that these ambitious newcomers are facing is that from the get-go, they had to announce very large-scale plans in order to be attractive for financiers,” said Robert Heiler, senior manager at Porsche Consulting, part of the sportscar unit of Volkswagen, Northvolt’s top investor. “But it’s really difficult to scale up” various operations “all at the same time,” he said. Just how badly Northvolt and its financiers misjudged the situation a year ago has now become evident. Last fall, the company invited investment banks to pitch for roles in an initial public offering that could have valued the battery maker at $20 billion, the FT then reported. A little over six months later, the IPO was pushed back from 2024, Bloomberg reported. Soon after that, VW’s truck unit Scania complained after Northvolt had trouble ramping up production volumes, and then BMW pulled its €2 billion ($2.1 billion) contract to equip electric vehicles such as the i4 sedan and iX sports utility vehicle. After repeated delays, the battery maker was unlikely to be able to produce the volumes BMW needed before 2026 — a year after predecessor models were set to be gradually phased out and almost three years after the original target date, a person familiar with the matter said, declining to be named discussing private information. Around that time, a failure to close on an equity funding round meant that a $5 billion green loan that was announced in January remained frozen, according to another person. Even then, there was a chance for Northvolt to continue with plans for new battery plants in Germany, Sweden and Canada. In late June, Volkswagen — which owns 23% of Northvolt — was prepared to step in, this person said. A representative for VW declined to comment. But the German auto giant was facing a crisis of its own. By late summer, with EV sales stagnant in Europe and its lucrative Chinese business flagging, VW called for unprecedented factory closures in Germany. Against the backdrop of potentially tens of thousands of layoffs at VW, Northvolt funding was off the table, and in August, VW withdrew from the equity plan, the person said. A Volkswagen representative declined to comment. The German automaker, which had valued its Northvolt holding at the equivalent of more than $730 million as of the end of 2023, then balked at committing to more battery purchases, people familiar with the matter said this month. Still, work on a bridge funding deal continued, with an agreement coming close to fruition as recently as October. The $300 million in emergency aid would have involved lenders, creditors and customers, but talks fell short. “In this latest funding round, VW basically told us that they are not able to continue to capitalize us,” Carlsson said on Friday. Northvolt’s debts include a $330 million convertible loan from Volkswagen that’s due in December 2025, according to the bankruptcy court filing. In its bid to reassure financiers, Northvolt nixed a planned expansion of its main plant in Skelleftea in northern Sweden and, in October, replaced the factory’s manager. But Carlsson acknowledges that he acted too slowly. “I should have probably pulled the brake earlier on some of the expansion paths,” he said. Northvolt’s big-swing approach will be second-guessed for years to come. But it won’t disappear in the immediate future. In its filing, the company said finding a strategic or financial partner is an overarching goal as it seeks to restructure the balance sheet and continue operations. Governments — from Stockholm to Berlin — have rebuffed suggestions they’d spend taxpayer funds on a rescue. German Economy Minister Robert Habeck, who had in June suggested Northvolt should build a second factory in his home country, on Saturday told DPA that he’s “cautiously optimistic” about the company’s future. The relationship with Volkswagen continues. Scania CV AB remains a key Northvolt customer and will provide $100 million in debtor-in-possession financing at a hefty interest rate of 16%. Northvolt will also have access to about $145 million in cash collateral. Battery plants under construction in Germany and Canada were left out of the bankruptcy, though the company said these projects will be postponed. Northvolt is also making preparations in case it fails to raise funds for the future. Documents filed with the US court show that it plans to “assess potential opportunities for a sale of some or all assets and has engaged Hilco Global to assist with an orderly liquidation process if necessary.” --With assistance from Sonja Wind, Kamil Kowalcze, William Wilkes, Sara Sjolin, Rafaela Lindeberg and Luca Casiraghi.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/guyanas-pick-us-startup-faces-110506573.html,"Mon, Nov 25, 2024, 6:50 PM","By Curtis Williams and Kemol King HOUSTON/GEORGETOWN (Reuters) -Guyana's dreams of developing its vast natural gas resources are stuck on the drawing board five months after it picked a little-known U.S. startup, Fulcrum LNG, to develop an export project that could cost up to $30 billion. Guyana has one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, thanks to the rapid rise in oil production at lucrative offshore fields developed by Exxon Mobil. But the South American country lacks the infrastructure to use the gas produced at those fields, which is reinjected to maintain pressure. The government selected Fulcrum LNG in June over 16 other candidates - including top liquefied natural gas (LNG) and gas pipeline firms - to develop its gas resources and create a new revenue stream apart from oil, which is all exported. The country's leadership said it wanted to expand its partnerships beyond the consortium led by Exxon that produces all the oil in the new energy hotspot. Fulcrum LNG was founded a year ago by former Exxon executive Jesus Bronchalo. It was an unusual choice to pull off LNG and infrastructure projects that will require significant expertise and financial clout, industry experts and Guyana advisers said. Fulcrum LNG ""lacks requisite experience and a demonstrated ability to raise the type of multi-billion-dollar finances required,"" said Elson Low, an economist and adviser to the opposition People's National Congress party. Bronchalo did not respond to Reuters requests for comment. He is Fulcrum's CEO, secretary, treasurer, director and president. The only other person associated with the company, the technical director, also did not respond to requests for information. Government officials have begun to describe the selection of Fulcrum for the contract as tentative. ""No project has been awarded to anyone. We're in an exploratory phase,"" Guyana's Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo told Reuters last month. That is a shift in the language used by the ministry of finance when it cited the award of the contract as among its economic achievements this year. Guyana's president, who announced the award, said an agreement, that may or may not include Exxon, was expected next year. When Fulcrum was selected, Bronchalo said on LinkedIn he was delighted and honored to be selected ""to design, finance, construct and operate the required gas infrastructure."" The company plans to pair up with U.S. oil services firm Baker Hughes and construction contractor McDermott. Fulcrum's proposal would include financing from the U.S. Export-Import Bank and the participation of private equity firms and an environmental partner, the government said. Fulcrum has yet to make public any details on those investors. The U.S. Export-Import Bank and McDermott did not reply to requests for comment, and Baker Hughes referred questions to Fulcrum. It would be ""very difficult"" for a startup to raise the financing for a multi-billion-dollar infrastructure project, said Ira Joseph, an LNG market expert and senior researcher at Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy. The project was designed to help the country add to its energy revenue. Last year, Guyana's take from oil royalties and fees was $1.6 billion, compared with $6.33 billion in profit that went to the Exxon-led consortium. FULCRUM Guyana picked Nevada-registered Fulcrum, which it said offered ""the most comprehensive and technically sound proposal,"" among the bidders, including China's third-largest oil firm CNOOC, U.S. gas pipeline giant Energy Transfer, and the No. 4 U.S. LNG exporter Venture Global LNG. Fulcrum's website does not identify any prior projects, but claims ""extensive experience in origination of new opportunities to access and capture global LNG markets."" Guyanese officials now say they chose Fulcrum without first determining whether it could raise the money to tap the enormous gas reserves. The technical committee that selected Fulcrum was confident it could raise money for the projects, Jagdeo told Reuters. ""They represented they had the capacity to raise the money."" Minister of Natural Resources Vickram Bharrat said Bronchalo's expertise, having worked at Exxon in Guyana and Asia for two decades helping to negotiate contracts, swung the selection in his favor. ""We don't have the expertise and capability in government, especially when it comes to gas ... we expect Fulcrum will have the capability and experience,"" he said in an interview in October. COLLABORATION OR CONFLICT Exxon's consortium with Hess and CNOOC has discovered more than 11 billion barrels of oil off Guyana's Caribbean coast since 2015, and produced 500 million barrels of crude from its Stabroek block since 2019, turning the tiny country overnight into a significant global oil producer. The government has been pressing the group to come up with a plan to convert its about 16 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves into valuable exports such as LNG or relinquish areas where gas has been discovered so they can be developed by others. Gas would help develop the country’s manufacturing and food sectors and help make it a regional energy powerhouse. ""Why isn't Exxon building the LNG plant itself?"" said Joseph. ""It is very hard to raise that kind of money to make a project work, (Guyana) would have to bring in one of the big players like TotalEnergies or Shell."" The oil major believes it alone can decide how to use that gas, a person familiar with the company's position said, citing the agreement it has with Guyana. So far, Exxon's only planned use for the gas is a small gas-to-power project. Exxon's Guyana country manager Alistair Routledge told Reuters the company would make a decision on tapping newer discoveries containing mostly gas by mid-2025. He has said the earliest production could start would be in 2029 or 2030. Jagdeo said Guyana wants Fulcrum to work with Exxon, but would push forward with or without it. If, however, Exxon does not act on the discoveries or return the acreage for auction to others willing to develop the gas, Guyana could claw back some offshore land, he said. ""Exxon did indicate that they are interested in the development of gas, but as the talks continue, we will see how much commitment is there in regards to gas,"" Minister Bharrat said.

The company declined to give any further details about the scope, geography or quantum of the scrutiny it is facing, and did not respond to questions during the private bondholder call. “We voluntarily disclosed to the US Department of Justice information related to possible violations of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act,” a spokesperson for Digicel said in an emailed statement on Monday in response to Bloomberg queries. “We are cooperating fully with the DOJ and will continue to do so.” Digicel’s $1.3 billion payment-in-kind bond due in 2027 dropped at the end of last week and was trading at around 96.5 cents on the dollar as of Monday afternoon New York time, according to Trace pricing data. In a disclosure made to bondholders last week and seen by Bloomberg News, the company said that there were possible violations in a number of jurisdictions. Digicel also warned that the outcome of the investigations were unknown and could be material to the firm’s financial condition. Founded by Irish tycoon Denis O’Brien, Digicel operates in the Caribbean and Central America.

Wood's firm makes a move on two of the biggest names in the tech sector. If you're an investor looking for high-yield investments with some solid upside potential, there is perhaps no better place to look than the energy midstream space.  The sector has gone through a transformation in the past decade, with midstream companies reducing leverage and being more disciplined when it comes to funding growth projects.  Against that backdrop, let's look a three great MLPs -- Enterprise Products Partners (NYSE: EPD), Energy Transfer (NYSE: ET), and Western Midstream (NYSE: WES) -- investors might want to consider buying and holding forever. Last week, fund managers of a certain size disclosed their stock holdings for the third quarter ending on Sept. 30.  Fund managers are required to do this 45 days after the close of each quarter in a 13F form filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  One investor who filed their 13F form is Michael Burry of Scion Asset Management. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) supplies the most advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) for developing artificial intelligence (AI) models.  Many of the world's largest technology companies are spending boatloads of money to fill their data centers with those chips as they jostle for leadership in the AI race.  As a result, Nvidia's data center revenue generated triple-digit percentage growth in each of the last six quarters. A lot of good things have happened at ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP), but none of them matter much because of one overriding issue.  If you are trying to build a million-dollar portfolio, this energy giant could help you get there.  At the end of May 2024, ConocoPhillips announced that it was planning to buy Marathon Oil. Englander has taken a contrarian approach by selling Wall Street's hottest artificial intelligence (AI) stock in favor of a premier healthcare company that's more than 90% below its all-time high. Factors contributing to that upside include enthusiasm about artificial intelligence, strong corporate earnings, and encouraging economic data.  The Federal Reserve's recent pivot to interest rate cuts has also bolstered investor sentiment.  Policymakers raised the federal funds rate at the fastest pace in decades to stamp out fierce inflation post-pandemic. Chevron’s exploration in this African country could be a big catalyst if a new discovery is made, Citi strategists say. Consider, for example, that a study by Hartford Funds and Ned Davis Research found that between 1973 and 2023, companies that grew or initiated dividend payments delivered annualized returns of 10.2%, while dividend non-payers delivered only 4.3% (and an equal-weight S&P 500 fund averaged 7.7%).  Healthy and growing dividend payers will tend to have stock prices that rise over time, while paying dividends that are also increased over time.  Given that stock profile, you might think it's smart to snap up the fattest dividend yields you can find -- perhaps focusing on the biggest dividend yields in the S&P 500. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has roared higher in recent years -- and it's continued with that momentum this year, as it's heading for a gain of more than 185%.  Nvidia has become the ""go to"" company for AI and counts the world's top tech companies as its customers.

The number of tech initial public offerings will “likely more than double” in 2025, with the rate of companies debuting by the end of the year getting more in line with an annual average of about 34, said Will Connolly, the Wall Street bank’s head of technology equity capital markets. “There’s a massive population of big, scaled companies in tech that are IPO candidates and there’s a lot of demand to put money to work,” said Connolly, speaking on the sidelines of Goldman Sachs’ Private Innovative Company Conference in Las Vegas last week. “The question is how quickly can people recalibrate to a more active IPO market,” Connolly said. Technology IPOs have been slow to return to health since the pandemic, amid a slump in startup valuations.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-expands-warehouse-robots-mean-165024514.html,"Mon, Nov 25, 2024, 8:50 AM","Amazon has introduced a handful of robots in its warehouses that the e-commerce giant says will improve efficiency and reduce employee injuries. Two robotic arms named Robin and Cardinal can lift packages that weigh up to 50 pounds. A third, called Sparrow, picks up items from bins and puts them in other containers. Proteus, an autonomous mobile robot that operates on the floor, can move carts around a warehouse. The bipedal, humanoid robot Digit is being tested to help move empty totes with its hands. And there’s also Sequoia, a containerized storage system that can present totes to employees in a way that allows them to avoid stretching or squatting to grab inventory. Amazon says Robin is currently being used in dozens of warehouses. The others are in a testing stage or haven’t been rolled out widely. But the company says it's already seeing benefits, such as reducing the time it takes to fulfill orders and helping employees avoid repetitive tasks. However, automation also carries drawbacks for workers, who would have to be retrained for new positions if the robots made their roles obsolete. In October, Amazon held an event at a Nashville, Tennessee, warehouse where the company had integrated some of the robots. The Associated Press spoke with Julie Mitchell, the director of Amazon’s robotic sortation technologies, about where the company hopes to go from here. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Q: When you’re working on robotics, how long does it typically take to roll out new technology? A: This journey that we’ve been on has taken a couple of years. Luckily for us, we’ve been at this for over a decade. So we have a lot of core technology that we can build on top of. We started these particular robots - Cardinal and Proteus - in this building in November 2022. We came in and began playing around with what it would look like to pack and move a production order. Less than two years later, we are at scale and shipping 70% of the items in this building through that robotics system. Q: So, two years? A: We talk about “build, test and scale” and that’s about a two-year cycle for us right now. Q: It's challenging to build robots that can physically grab products. How does Amazon work through that? A: As you can probably imagine, we have so many items, so it’s an exceptional challenge. We rely on data and putting our first prototype in a real building, where we expose it to all the things we need it to do. Then we drive down all the reasons that it fails. We give it a lot of sample sizes in a very short period of time. For example, a couple of years ago, we launched our Robin robotics arm – a package manipulation robot – and we’re at 3 billion picks. So the ability to launch into our network, rapidly collect data, scale and iterate has enabled us to go fast. The challenge itself can be boiled down to three simple things: you need to perceive the scene, plan your motion and then execute. Today, those are three different parts of our system. Artificial intelligence is going to help us change all of that, and it’s going to be more outcome-driven, like asking it to pick up a bottle of water. We’re on the verge, so that’s why I’m personally excited to be here at the onset of generative AI and use it to dramatically improve the performance of our robotics. Q: How do you think about the impact of automation on Amazon’s workforce as you’re developing the technology? A: With the technology we’ve deployed here, we’re creating new roles for individuals that can acquire new skills to fulfill those roles. And these new skills are not something that is too difficult to achieve. You don’t need an engineering degree, Ph.D. or any really technical skills to support our robotics systems. We designed the systems so they’re easy to service and train on the job to be a reliability maintenance engineer. We are working backwards from the idea that we want to employ more skilled labor. These opportunities are obviously higher paid than the entry level jobs in our buildings. And partnering with MIT has helped us understand what matters most to our team as we’re deploying these technologies across our network. Q: Are you experiencing any challenges as you introduce these robots in your warehouses? A: Not in the adoption. We’re integrating it. But these are complex systems and this is the real world, so things go wrong. For example, we had bad weather due to the storms in the Southeast. When I look at the robotics systems data, I can tell the weather is bad outside because that dramatically affects how the ship dock works. When trucks don’t arrive on time or when they can’t leave, you see bottlenecks in the building in strange ways. Containers build up, we have to put them in different places, and then humans need to recover them. So communication between what our robotics system is doing and what we need employees in the building to do to recover is important. It's a collaboration of automation and humans to deal with real-world problems. It’s not a matter of having robotics take over but making it one system of humans and robotics working together to accomplish the goal of shipping the product.","has a handful of robots in its warehouses that the e-commerce says will improve efficiency injuries.

The Stockholm-based fintech said Monday its pretax loss shrank to 2 million kronor ($180,000) in the three quarters through September, compared to 1.77 billion kronor in the same period a year ago. Total revenue rose 23% to 20.3 billion kronor. Earlier this month, Klarna confidentially submitted a draft registration statement to the US Securities and Exchange Commission for an IPO. The number of shares it will offer and the price range have not yet been determined. Still, the company has seen its valuation boosted in recent months with analysts pegging it at about $14.6 billion in recent weeks. That’s an improvement from the $6.7 billion price tag it garnered in its last fundraising in 2022, but it’s all a far cry from the $45.6 billion price tag Klarna got in 2021 during the height of the fintech boom. Partner Boosts The company has refocused ahead of the planned IPO, shedding businesses, focusing on payment partners, and investing in artificial intelligence. In recent months, Klarna agreed to divest its Checkout payments business for about $520 million while it also snapped up Laybuy, a provider of buy-now, pay-later services in New Zealand. In the third quarter, the firm reported net income of 216 million kronor, up 57% on a year ago and its second profitable quarter in a row using this measurement. “We’re back in familiar territory: profit and growth, just like the old days,” Sebastian Siemiatkowski, chief executive officer, said in a statement. Klarna last week announced it will offer buy-now, pay-later credit to US shoppers using Google Pay, tying it up with another tech giant a month after its partnership with Apple Inc. The Swedish firm has also struck deals with Dutch payments giant Adyen, Xero and Worldpay in recent weeks, as it looks for growth via mainstream payment processors. Klarna has 85 million customers around the world and 600,000 retail partners.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-trump-prepares-wide-ranging-110317746.html,"Mon, Nov 25, 2024, 3:03 AM","By Jarrett Renshaw (Reuters) - Donald Trump's transition team is putting together a wide-ranging energy package to roll out within days of his taking office that would approve export permits for new liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects and increase oil drilling off the U.S. coast and on federal lands, according to two sources familiar with the plans. The energy checklist largely reflects promises Trump made on the campaign trail, but the plan to roll out the list as early as day one ensures that oil and gas production will rank alongside immigration as a pillar of Trump's early agenda. Trump, a Republican, also plans to repeal some of his Democratic predecessor's key climate legislation and regulations, such as tax credits for electric vehicles and new clean power plant standards that aim to phase out coal and natural gas, the sources said. An early priority would be lifting President Joe Biden's election-year pause on new export permits for LNG and moving swiftly to approve pending permits, the sources said. Trump would also look to expedite drilling permits on federal lands and quickly reopen five-year drilling plans off the U.S. coast to include more lease sales, the sources said. In a symbolic gesture, Trump would seek to approve the Keystone Pipeline, an issue that was an environmental flashpoint and which was halted after Biden canceled a key permit on his first day in office. But any company looking to build the multibillion-dollar effort to carry Canadian crude oil to the U.S. would need to start from scratch because things like easements have been returned to landowners. ""The American people can bank on President Trump using his executive power on day one to deliver on the promises he made to them on the campaign trail,"" Karoline Leavitt, Trump's transition spokesperson, said in a statement. Many of the elements in the plan would require time to move through Congress or the nation's regulatory system. Trump has promised to declare an energy emergency on his first day in office that could test whether he can bypass those barriers to impose some changes on an accelerated schedule. Trump would also call on Congress to provide new funding so he can replenish the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, established as an emergency crude oil supply and which was depleted under Biden to help manage price spikes caused by the Ukraine crisis and high inflation during the pandemic. Replenishing the reserve would boost short-term oil demand and encourage U.S. production. Trump is also expected to put pressure on the International Energy Agency, the Paris-based energy watchdog that advises industrialized countries on energy policy. Republicans have criticized the IEA's focus on policies to reduce emissions. Trump's advisers have urged him to withhold funding unless the IEA takes a more pro-oil position. ""I have pushed Trump in person and his team generally on pressuring the IEA to return to its core mission of energy security and to pivot away from greenwashing,"" said Dan Eberhart, CEO of oilfield service firm Canary. TRUMP 'PLANS TO GO STRONG' ON LNG Biden put a freeze on new LNG export permits in January to study the environmental impacts, in an election-year move aimed at making gains with the party's green voting blocs. Without the export permits, developers cannot go ahead with multi-year construction plans for new projects. Projects delayed include Venture Global's CP2, Commonwealth LNG, and Energy Transfer's Lake Charles complex, all of which are in Louisiana. The United States is the world's top producer of natural gas, and became the No. 1 exporter of LNG in 2022 as Europe looked to America to wean itself off Russia's vast energy supplies following the invasion of Ukraine. The Biden administration promised to release the environmental study before Trump assumes the White House on Jan. 20, but it would have no influence on the incoming administration, the sources said. ""The LNG issue is a lay-up and he plans to go strong on the issue,"" said one of the sources. There are five U.S. LNG export projects that have been approved by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, but are still awaiting permit approvals at the Department of Energy, federal records show. Biden's pause also halted necessary environmental reviews, portions of which may still be needed for the five pending DOE permits to withstand legal scrutiny. LOOKING TO DRILL OFFSHORE AND ON FEDERAL LANDS Trump would look to accelerate drilling off the U.S. coast and on federal lands. The average time to complete a drilling permit on federal and Indian land averaged 258 days in the first three years of Biden's administration, up from 172 days during the four years of Trump's presidency, according to federal data. Trump is expected to expedite pending permits, hold sales more frequently and offer land that is more likely to deliver oil, the sources said. Despite the lag time in permit approvals, Biden's Interior Department approved more onshore oil drilling permits on average than Trump's first administration, federal records show. Oil output on federal lands and waters hit a record in 2023, while gas production reached its highest level since 2016, according to federal data. Drilling activity on federal lands and waters accounts for about a quarter of U.S. oil production and 12% of gas output.

Adani Group has denied all the accusations as ""baseless"", but its 10 listed entities have lost about $33 billion in market value since the indictment, with Adani Green the hardest hit, losing about $9.7 billion in market value. Here are key details of the conglomerate's stalled deals: ** French oil major TotalEnergies will not make any more investments in the Adani Group, saying that it was not informed of the U.S. bribery charges against Gautam Adani. Total has a 20% stake in Adani Green Energy, putting its financial exposure in Adani firms at between $4 billion and $5 billion, Bernstein Research estimates. Shares of Adani Green Energy plunged more than 11% after TotalEnergies' statement, while those of Adani Total Gas, in which Total holds 37.4%, closed down 1.4%. ** The U.S. International Development Finance Corp is reviewing the impact of the indictment against Gautam Adani on the agency's plan to lend $550 million for a port development project in Sri Lanka partly owned by Adani Group. Last November, the agency said it would provide financing for the port terminal project in the key city of Colombo. ** Sri Lanka is studying the accusations against Adani Group and will consider all aspects of its projects in the island nation. The government is taking the concerns seriously but has made no final decision yet. ** Kenya has canceled a procurement process of more than $2 billion that was expected to give control of its main airport to the Adani Group. The deal was to add a second runway at the Jomo Kenyatta international airport and upgrade the passenger terminal in exchange for a 30-year lease.

Citgo, the crown jewel of Venezuela's overseas assets, sits at the center of a Delaware court auction in which 18 companies seek to collect up to $21.3 billion for debt defaults and expropriations in the South American country. Bids in the auction's second round were submitted this year, and the advisers, including an officer appointed by the court to oversee the process, were to deliver a recommended winner in July. The advisers went on to negotiate exclusively with an affiliate of investor Elliott Investment Management, which has resulted in a bid opposed by many creditors as deficient. Four creditors in a court filing challenged the advisers' $4.1 million bill for September, saying fees ""have increased by a staggering amount"" and were likely to go higher. The latest bill is five-and-a-half times the fees for September 2023 and includes costs for more than 70 law firm employees, with individual charges up to $2,350 an hour. Rusoro Mining, which has a pending $1.48 billion claim in the case, also criticized the advisers' reworking of one proposal, calling the result neither ""a material improvement or a helpful development."" U.S. Judge Leonard Stark last week rebuked law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges, investment banker Evercore and court official Robert Pincus for not following his rules in their dealings with Elliott affiliate Amber. Representatives for Weil, Evercore, and Pincus did not reply to requests for comment. Stark proposed to redirect the auction, leave behind one of the red lines set by Amber, provide bid details to the 18 companies and provide them a say in how proceeds are to be distributed. Amber has threatened to walk away if the auction proceeds as Stark has indicated he wants it to go. An Amber spokesperson did not have an immediate comment. The revised process is expected to lead to at least two bids once Citgo reopens access to its financial and operational data. The winner could receive three U.S. oil refineries, energy pipelines, distribution terminals, and fuel supply to 4,200 retail outlets. Groups involved in the auction have repeatedly told Pincus that he ""should stop wasting time and money pursuing Elliott's non-viable and inadequate bid,"" an attorney for Venezuela wrote to the court.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/google-test-plain-blue-results-104152123.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 2:41 AM","Google has announced it's making more changes to how it displays search results in the European Union in response to continued complaints that it's failing to comply with the bloc's Digital Markets Act (DMA). This will include what it bills as a “short test” of plain “blue link” style search results for hotel queries in three EU markets (Belgium, Estonia and Germany) which will be akin -- the company suggests -- to how its search engine originally displayed results. The EU's flagship market contestability reform carries hefty penalties for non-compliance of up to 10% of global annual turnover (or more for repeat offences). Alphabet, Google's parent, has been under investigation since March in relation to new rich features it launched in response to the DMA, but which rivals argue undermine the regulation's ban on self preferencing. Travel comparison sites have been among those who have continued to complain that Google is trying to circumvent its obligations. Google has fought back by claiming the changes to search have penalized other players in the travel ecosystem. In a new blog post on Tuesday -- attributed to Oliver Bethell, director, legal, Google -- it suggests that “direct booking clicks” to airlines, hotel operators and small retailers have dropped by around a third (30%). The tech giant appears to be attempting a 'divide and conquer' strategy in response to the DMA, which seeks to use compliance changes to play its main rivals (“large online travel aggregators”) off against other travel retailers that its search engine has the power to uplift or degrade based on how much traffic it sends them. Ironically, the DMA is an attempt to prevent gatekeepers from flexing market muscle unfairly, so it will be interesting to see what the European Commission makes of the tactic. The latest changes Google is proposing to how it displays search results will affect more than just the travel vertical -- also impacting product searches and restaurants, per the company's blog post. “We think the latest proposal is the right way to balance the difficult trade-offs that the DMA involves,” it writes, adding that it “still hope[s] to be able to reach a solution that complies with the law and continues to provide European users and businesses with access to helpful technology”. The changes Google's blog post announces include displaying what it claims will be “expanded and equally formatted” units in search results when users search for products, restaurants, flights or hotels that will let people choose between results that take them to Google rivals (comparison sites, meta search engines, review sites, etc.) or results that take them directly to supplier or retailer websites. A lot will hinge on how Google presents this choice, but the blog post does not offer any visual examples. Additionally, the blog post says it will introduce “other new formats that allow comparison sites and suppliers to show more information about what is on their websites, like prices and pictures”. Again, no visual examples are provided. Finally, Google says it will launch new ad units for comparison sites. But, again, we will have to wait to see what these look like. A key complaint of travel aggregators over Google's initial DMA response was that the company was switching from unfairly competing with them by placing its own comparison services in eye-catching box-outs directly at the top of search results to unfairly competing with them by baking comparison site-style features into the top of search results and using a suite of new platform features to try to keep users in Google by discouraging them from clicking away to rival services. Google's rejoinder has been to claim it's being forced to degrade the quality of the search experience it can offer Europeans by making it less useful. Bethell continues this attack line in the blog post, as well as implying the DMA is preventing Google from “innovating and competing”. Complaints have continued, however. Travel aggregators are also unhappy about rich features that Google now displays in relation to hotel search queries, which shows a map view of hotels in the desired location along with pricing info and links to featured hotels websites. The visually rich feature looks intended to drive search traffic direct to suppliers (in that case, hotels) -- which could leave comparison sites out in the cold. “While many stakeholders are happy with our changes, a few sites continue to demand more, such as a complete ban on anything that’s more sophisticated than a simple blue link to a website. This would prevent Google from showing people useful information like prices and ratings,” Bethell goes on -- teeing up the announcement of the aforementioned “blue link” test. This is not being framed as a DMA change Google wants to make. On the contrary, it's dubbed a “short test” so it can “understand how such changes would impact both the user experience and traffic to websites.” “The test will remove some of the features that have been at the focus of the debate, including the map that shows where hotels are and hotel results underneath it. Instead, we will show a list of individual links to websites without any of the additional features -- similar to our old 'ten blue links' format from years ago,” it adds. Google claims it's “very reluctant” to run the test at all, implying it believes it's being forced to this pass -- and forced to degrade the quality of search for EU users -- by rivals demanding it wind back the product experience to an earlier internet epoch. (Albeit, web users tired of Google's endlessly self-serving reshaping of search results might welcome the return of a few plain blue links, TBH.) It's not clear how long the test will run, but Google says hotel search results will return to “normal” -- whatever that means in this chameleonic context -- once the data-gathering exercise ends. We reached out to the European Commission for a response to Google's proposal. “All we can say is that we’re currently assessing Google’s compliance proposals,” EU spokeswoman, Lea Zuber, responded. Google is not only under pressure over this element of its DMA compliance. Last week privacy-focused search rival DuckDuckGo urged the Commission to wide its investigation of the tech giant -- accusing it of failing to provide comprehensive “click and query” data to rivals; and redoubling its complaints that choice screens the DMA requires Google to display are not working as it says they don't currently allow users to switch away from Google's products easily enough.

Cyberattacks have cost British businesses around 44 billion pounds ($55.08 billion) in lost revenue in the past five years, with 52% of private sector companies reporting at least one attack in that time, insurance broker Howden said on Monday.  Cyberattacks cost businesses 1.9% of their revenue on average, Howden said, with companies generating an annual revenue of over 100 million pounds most likely to suffer an attack.  The most common causes of cyberattacks were compromised emails, at 20%, and data theft, at 18% of cases, Howden said. Wood's firm makes a move on two of the biggest names in the tech sector. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) stock has roared higher in recent years -- and it's continued with that momentum this year, as it's heading for a gain of more than 185%.  Nvidia has become the ""go to"" company for AI and counts the world's top tech companies as its customers.  This strength along with the growth forecast for the entire AI market make Nvidia a great long-term stock to own. If you're an investor looking for high-yield investments with some solid upside potential, there is perhaps no better place to look than the energy midstream space.

Many of the world's largest technology companies are spending boatloads of money to fill their data centers with those chips as they jostle for leadership in the AI race.  As a result, Nvidia's data center revenue generated triple-digit percentage growth in each of the last six quarters.

Similar to its existing efforts, Spotify for Artists and Spotify for Creators (previously Podcasters), Spotify for Authors will allow writers and publishers to track insights and analytics about their audiobooks' and catalog's consumption on the service as well as access a set of promotional tools. The company notes that the platform will be available to authors and publishers of any size, and will help them to better understand their audience as they'll learn not only about the books they listen to, but also what sort of podcasts their audience consumes. This unique ability to combine listening data could help authors better determine which podcasts to work with when promoting their book and more generally, what types of shows might work best as places for running ads. With the analytics, authors, and publishers will gain insights into the aggregated ages and gender demographics of their listeners and use marketing tools like redemption codes for sharing royalty-free copies (if the publisher allows).

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/berlins-traditional-christmas-markets-reflect-130826754.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 5:08 AM","BERLIN (AP) — The smells of mulled wine, roasted almonds and hot bratwurst are wafting through the air across the German capital again, as the city's more than 100 Christmas markets are opening their doors this week. But the annual tradition that Germans have cherished since the Middle Ages — and successfully exported to much of the Western world — has become a pretty diverse affair, at least in Berlin. The city of 3.8 million, which takes pride in its tolerance and diversity, offers Christmas markets for pretty much every taste these days. Nowadays, almost 40% of Berliners have immigrant roots, and the city's LGBTQ+ community is considered one of the biggest in the country. So it comes as no surprise that popular Christmas markets include a LGBTQ+ one offering rainbow pierogi and entertainment by drag queens, a Scandinavian market selling moose goulash and reindeer salami and a market tempting revelers with naughty gift ideas, along with a historical market that takes visitors back to medieval times. “It’s a lovely atmosphere,” Paul Middleton said of the LGBTQ+ market Christmas Avenue, which is illuminated in the colors of the rainbow. “It’s great to do something for the LGBTQ+ community and offer something positive in a safe environment where everyone’s welcome, no matter what background,” said Middleton, who moved to Berlin from London three years ago “for love."" Middleton was busy selling gay-themed Christmas shirts next to stalls offering suggestive candles and soaps in neon colors. The market also attracts heterosexual couples, neighborhood residents and groups of moms with baby strollers, said Sebastian Ahlefeld, a spokesman for Christmas Avenue. “You can meet lots of friends, relax, enjoy a mulled wine and simply kick off the Christmas season,” said Marco Klingberg, who visited the market with friends on Monday night. Klingberg, a police officer and member of the LGBTQ+ police organization in Brandenburg, the state surrounding Berlin, pointed out that despite the city's reputation as a gay-friendly city, attacks on members of the community are a concern, and it was great to have a protected environment for celebrating. “First and foremost, it’s a safe space,” he said. Security is an issue not only at the LGBTQ+ market, where all visitors undergo a bag check before entering. Groups of police officers were patrolling most markets on Monday night, as memories of a deadly terror attack on a Christmas market eight years ago are still fresh for many Berliners. On Dec. 19, 2016, an Islamist attacker plowed through a crowd of Christmas market-goers with a truck, killing 13 people and injuring dozens more in the German capital. The attacker was killed days later in a shootout in Italy. Despite increased surveillance, visitors at the Scandinavian-themed Lucia market in Berlin's Prenzlauer Berg neighborhood were hanging out in crowds on the compound of a former brewery. Kids enjoyed merry-go-rounds while their parents stood in line for Finnish honey and Icelandic mulled wine infused with hard liquor, or chatted and warmed up at fire pits. “I've been coming here every year since kindergarten times,” said Mathilda Schmidt, 21, pointing to kids cheering as they jumped on a trampoline. She was standing in line with her boyfriend for a bratwurst and potato pancakes. At Humboldt Forum Christmas market near the Spree river, vendors were offering more exotic dishes including jerk chicken with cooked bananas at a Jamaican food stand, Argentinian empanadas, French salamis and Hungarian langos, a deep-fried flatbread. While the city's biggest markets are open for weeks and usually close only the day before Christmas Eve, smaller markets often open for a weekend or a day. They include the Kinky Christmas market in the Kreuzberg neighborhood that invites visitors on Dec. 1 only, seeking those who may find traditional markets “too overwhelmingly contemplative and traditional.” Over 20 stalls will offer sexy “fashion, accessories, jewelry, toys and all kinds of naughty gift ideas,” the city of Berlin says on its website.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/consumer-confidence-hits-2-high-161128716.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 8:11 AM","American consumers are feeling better about the economy than they have in years, as the latest data Tuesday from The Conference Board shows. The Consumer Confidence Index rose from 111.3 in October to 111.7 in November, reaching its highest level in nearly two years, aided by an improving labor market and easing concerns about a potential recession. ""The proportion of consumers anticipating a recession over the next 12 months fell further in November and was the lowest since we first asked the question in July 2022,"" said Dana M. Peterson, chief economist at The Conference Board. The surge in consumer confidence was fueled by the Present Situation Index, which reflects business and labor market conditions. That metric jumped 4.8 points to 140.9, signaling widespread belief in the strength of the job market. Notably, 33.4% of respondents said jobs were “plentiful,” while only 15.2% said jobs were “hard to get.” Both figures improved compared to October. Consumers are also optimistic about the future availability of jobs. In November, 21.7% expected more jobs to be available in six months, up sharply from 18.4% in October. It's the most upbeat reading on job prospects in nearly three years. ""November's increase was mainly driven by more positive consumer assessments of the present situation, particularly regarding the labor market,"" Peterson said. Confidence surged among younger Americans in November, with consumers under 35 driving much of the increase. Sentiment among those aged 35-54 dipped slightly after strong gains in October. Among income groups, households earning over $100,000 and those under $35,000 saw the most optimism, while the wealthiest consumers — earning above $125,000 — reported flat or slightly declining confidence. One of the most striking developments in the report is the collapse in recession fears. Recession expectations for the next 12 months have reached their lowest level since mid-2022, The Conference Board said. With the Expectations Index rising slightly to 92.3, well above the critical threshold of 80 that often signals economic downturn, consumers are showing little concern about a looming slowdown. “Consumers' optimism for their finances over the next six months reached a new high, even as their assessments of their family's current financial situation fell slightly,” Peterson said. Regarding spending preferences, plans to buy homes have stalled, while auto-buying intentions ticked up slightly. Buying plans for most appliances and electronics declined. Spending on services, particularly travel and health care, remains a bright spot, with consumers prioritizing experiences over material goods. Wall Street appears to have won over Main Street. A staggering 56.4% of consumers now believe stock prices will rise over the next year, a record-high share for this metric. Just 21.3% of respondents expect stocks to decline, marking a sharp contrast to the bearish sentiment seen earlier in the year. In addition, expectations for lower interest rates have increased. Over one-third of consumers (34.6%) now believe rates will fall in the next 12 months, the highest figure since April 2020. Inflation expectations continued to moderate, with consumers projecting 12-month inflation at 4.9%, down from 5.3% in October. That's the lowest reading since March 2020, reflecting growing confidence that price pressures are cooling. Write-in survey responses showed a decline in mentions of inflation, though higher prices remain a top concern for 2025. Interestingly, when asked about their hopes and worries for the coming year, consumers overwhelmingly prioritized lower prices and improved household finances. Paying off debt, saving more money and reducing taxes also ranked high on their wish list. Stocks delivered mixed performance during Tuesday morning’s session in New York, showing little reaction to the latest consumer confidence report. Among the major equity indices, the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 led gains, rising 0.5%, while the S&P 500 also advanced 0.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 0.6%. Wall Street remains on edge as concerns ripple through markets following President-elect Donald Trump's pledge to impose a 25% tariff on all imports from Mexico and Canada, part of a plan to curb drug trafficking into the U.S. Small-cap stocks lagged behind their larger peers, with the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM) falling 1%. This pullback comes after the Russell 2000 index hit a fresh all-time high on Monday. Consumer-oriented sectors also showed mixed performance. The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLY) rose 0.4%, while the Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLP) edged 0.1% lower.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-vows-tariffs-china-mexico-010652924.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 7:06 AM","(Bloomberg) -- Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field NYC's Underground Steam System May Be Key to a Greener Future NYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge President-elect Donald Trump vowed additional tariffs on Mexico, Canada and China, shaking markets with his first specific threats to the US’s top trading partners since his election win three weeks ago. Subscribe to the Bloomberg Daybreak podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen.​​​​​​ Trump said he would impose additional 10% tariffs on goods from China and 25% tariffs on all products from Mexico and Canada, in posts to his Truth Social network on Monday. The US dollar advanced on Tuesday, with the Mexican peso and the Canadian dollar among the worst performers. US Treasuries fell, with the yield on 10-year notes rising two basis points to 4.29%. That partially reversed the reaction to Scott Bessent’s nomination last week as Treasury secretary, which weighed on the dollar and boosted US bonds amid optimism of a more measured approach to trade relations. Trump’s market-moving threats were a stark reminder that he plans to wield tariff authority, or at least threaten to use it, as leverage against allies and adversaries alike. It’s another sign of his break from the international order where low tariffs are the goal and rules exist to discourage overreach of punitive trade actions. In his Truth Social posts, Trump cast the new import taxes as necessary to clamp down on migrants and illegal drugs flowing across borders. He accused China of failing to follow through on promises to institute the death penalty for traffickers of fentanyl, writing that “drugs are pouring into our Country, mostly through Mexico, at levels never seen before.” “Until such time as they stop, we will be charging China an additional 10% Tariff, above any additional Tariffs, on all of their many products coming into the United States of America,” Trump said. In another post, the incoming president also vowed to hit Mexico and Canada with a 25% tariff on “ALL products,” saying he would sign an executive order to that effect on his first day in office. “As everyone is aware, thousands of people are pouring through Mexico and Canada, bringing Crime and Drugs at levels never seen before,” he said. “This Tariff will remain in effect until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!” Earlier: What Trump’s New Tariff Push Means for the Economy: QuickTake Shortly after Trump’s post, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau contacted the president-elect and the two leaders had a phone call to discuss border security and trade, according to a government official with knowledge of the matter. Immigration Response Trudeau pointed out to Trump that the number of migrants who cross the Canadian border into the US is minuscule compared to those who cross from Mexico, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Canada said it’s working closely with US law enforcement agencies every day to disrupt the “scourge of the fentanyl coming from China and other countries,” according to a statement by Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland and Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc. Liu Pengyu, spokesman for the Chinese embassy in the US, said economic and trade cooperation between both countries is mutually beneficial. “No one will win a trade war or a tariff war,” he wrote in an X post. The Foreign Ministry in Beijing said in a statement Tuesday that China has provided support to America’s fight against fentanyl which is “US’s problem,” though it stopped short of mentioning any planned trade retaliation. Representatives for the Mexican Foreign Affairs Ministry and Economy Ministry, as well as China’s Commerce Ministry, didn’t immediately respond to requests to comment. Spokespeople for Trump didn’t immediately answer a question about whether there would be exemptions from the duties. Trump campaigned on pledges to implement sweeping tariffs, vowing to hike tariffs to 60% for all goods imported from China and as high as 20% for those brought in from the rest of the world — policies he says will help pressure companies to re-shore manufacturing jobs in the US and raise revenue for the federal government. President Joe Biden has already hiked tariffs on a variety of Chinese imports this year, including semiconductors, solar cells and critical minerals, with rates ranging from 25% for batteries to 100% for electric vehicles. The move was the culmination of a review of Trump’s tariff increases in his first term — none of which were rolled back. While it was unclear how Trump’s 10% tariff threat on China fit in with his previous statements calling for even higher duties, analysts saw this as an opening gambit aimed at the drug problem. China’s Response This “does not necessarily mean that Trump’s promised 60% tariffs on all Chinese imports are off the table,” said Neil Thomas, a fellow for Chinese politics at the Asia Society Policy Institute’s Center for China Analysis. “China will register its opposition and consider limited retaliation but is likely to respond cautiously at first to Trump’s threats, until it gets a better sense of the balance between confrontation and deal-making in his second term.” While public health experts say fentanyl overdoses remain a major issue, provisional data released earlier this month by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed a 14% drop in drug overdose deaths from June 2023 to June 2024. President Biden hailed US-China cooperation on counter-narcotics this month during a meeting with counterpart Xi Jinping in Peru. Higher North American tariffs would upend the auto industry and other consumer sectors, including food, in which the three countries are highly integrated. Mexico’s auto sector is particularly exposed to a trade conflict with the US, along with factories that export electronics, plastics and other manufactured goods to US consumers. Mexico became the US’s largest trading partner as China’s import share declined in recent years. The Mexican government estimates there’s now $800 billion annually in total trade between the nations. ‘Stir the Debate’ The Canadian and US auto industries are so intertwined, and work on such thin profit margins, that a 25% tariff is “not a real conversation,” said Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association, a Canadian industry group. “The president-elect has done what he’s famous for, which is try to stir the debate. The only surprise is how early he’s done it,” Volpe said. “What we learned in the first term was he uses strong rhetoric, public rhetoric. But the negotiations are always tough, but reasonable — and I’m just telling everybody to be patient.” A 25% tariff applied to all imports from Canada would put pressure on energy costs. Oil, gas and other energy products are Canada’s largest export to its southern neighbor; it’s by far the largest external supplier of crude to the US. Wilbur Ross, Trump’s former Commerce secretary, said earlier this month it would make no sense to place tariffs on Canadian energy. The move on Mexico and Canada would reignite a trade feud that simmered across the continental bloc during Trump’s first term, where he forced a renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement and imposed tariffs on certain sectors, including steel. Currently, the re-branded trade pact, known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, allows for duty-free trade across a wide range of sectors. It’s not clear what recourse American importers, who would pay the duties, would have under the pact to head off any levy. Beyond Bessent, Trump still has a number of top economic roles to fill in his administration. One of the chief architects of Trump’s tariff agenda, former United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer has yet to land a role in the second term. --With assistance from Josh Xiao, Philip Glamann, Cormac Mullen, Derek Decloet, Constantine Courcoulas, Josh Wingrove, Matthew Burgess, Carolina Millan, Maya Averbuch, Colum Murphy and Jing Li.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trumps-sharp-tariff-hikes-could-135217426.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 5:52 AM","YIWU, China (AP) — Visitors who bought fridge magnets at Times Square or other tourist hotspots around New York in recent years most likely were purchasing the work of Du Jing or one of her fellow exporters in a small Chinese city that supplies the U.S. and the world with tons of small commodities. Du and her husband run Yiwu Xianchuang Handicraft Manufacturing in the eastern city of Yiwu, home to the world’s largest wholesale market. Products from here -– ranging from plushies to glass vases and portable toolboxes -– are sold in stores and on online platforms around the world, including to U.S. consumers on Amazon. For years, the United States has been a major destination for Chinese goods, but exporters like those in Yiwu have been reducing their reliance on the world’s largest consumer market as Beijing and Washington feud over trade. Some have moved production to Southeast Asia and other parts of the world to evade U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Those trends look to accelerate under President-elect Donald Trump, who has threatened to sharply raise tariffs on all Chinese imports and close some loopholes exporters currently use to sell their products more cheaply in the U.S. If enacted, his plans would likely raise prices in America and squeeze sales and profit margins for Chinese exporters. Chinese exporters are already looking at new markets Du, speaking from her booth in the Yiwu wholesale market, the walls covered in colorful magnets and keychains, isn’t sure whether higher tariffs or a worsening U.S. market are to blame. What she knows is sales are down. “The U.S. market has shrunk a lot,” she said. “It gives me the feeling that it has something to do with their financial situation.” American customers have been putting a lot of pressure on prices since 2019, frowning at any product that wholesales for more than 25 cents, she said. In contrast, the Middle East has become a better market, with higher prices and increasingly larger orders, she said. Elsewhere in the sprawling market, the owner of Yiwu Bixuan Import Export Co. Ltd., echoed her thoughts. Chen Yong's trading company exports glass vases and other home decor, and Chen said business with the U.S. and Europe has suffered over the past few years – but it has boomed with other regions such as Southeast Asia, Africa, South America and Russia. The share of China's exports going to the U.S. dropped from 19% in 2018 to 15% last year, according to China customs data, even as China's overall exports are forecast to reach a record high this year. Trump has mentioned tariff hikes of 60% or more. On Monday, he said he would impose an extra 10% tariff on goods from China and a 25% tax on all products entering the country from Canada and Mexico as one of his first executive orders. Higher tariffs would force Chen to raise prices or accept lower profit margins, he said. If American customers won’t accept higher prices, the only choice would be to turn elsewhere. “We have to wait and see how much he will increase the tariff before knowing how big the impact on us can be,” he said. “We don’t know now.” An expert says 'no one can face' 60% tariffs A 60% tariff would have a severe impact on Chinese exports to the U.S., said Tu Xinquan, director of the China Institute for WTO Studies at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing. “Many companies will completely halt their trade with the U.S.,” he predicted. ""If the tariffs were not that huge, larger companies could cope better with the situation than medium and small companies. But if it’s 60%, no one can face that.” Light manufacturing and textiles are among the industries expected to be hit hardest by new tariffs, along with steel and computers, according to a report by Chinese brokerage Caicong Securities. During his first term in office, Trump imposed tariffs on more than $360 billion worth of Chinese products. The tariffs put the brakes on a fairly steady rise in Chinese exports to the U.S. They fell at first, then bounced back as the U.S. economy boomed, before leveling off at $500 billion last year. The Biden administration kept most of Trump's duties and layered on fresh ones on products such as steel, solar cells and electric vehicles. Biden’s approach has focused on sectors considered strategic, such as artificial intelligence and green energy. Trump’s proposed blanket tariffs could spill over into daily-use goods, pressuring smaller manufacturers like those in Yiwu. Furniture, toys and games were among the top Chinese export categories to the U.S. last year — after electronics and machinery — according to trade data compiled by the United Nations. Trump wants to end an exemption for shipments under $800 Trump has vowed to close loopholes through which Chinese goods bypass U.S. tariffs. One such loophole is an exemption that allows small packages under $800 to enter the U.S. duty free. Many of the products sold through Amazon’s third-party marketplace and on the Chinese platforms Temu and Shein qualify for this exemption. Biden’s administration proposed restricting the tax waiver for goods subject to U.S.-China tariffs, and Trump is expected to move forward with such restrictions, analysts said. “This would be a crushing blow to Chinese exporters who have built business models around those low-value exports,” said Eswar Prasad, a professor of trade policy at Cornell University and a former head of the China division at the International Monetary Fund. It would also be “a big loss to low-income American consumers,"" said Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, D.C. ""Evidence shows that they really benefit from the exemption.” Some Chinese companies are moving production abroad One workaround for Chinese companies has been moving production abroad. Since Trump started a trade war with China during his first administration, the average U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods have been about 20%, according to Ma Hong, a professor of economics at Tsinghua University in Beijing. To avoid these tariffs, some Chinese companies have shifted their factories to countries like Vietnam and Mexico. Shenzhen HIHO Luggage and Bag Industry Development Co., Ltd. opened a factory in Indonesia in 2021. The luggage producer employs about 600 workers in Indonesia and has a similar workforce in China, where it runs factories in three provinces. The company exports about a quarter of its production to the U.S., according to its marketing director, Steven Wang. He believes that some of the company’s clients in Mexico may also be reselling their products to the U.S. “No one likes to do business at a loss,” Wang said. “If Trump imposes any additional tariffs on Chinese goods from ASEAN countries or Mexico, we may need to move the factories somewhere else.” ___ Mistreanu reported from Taipei, Taiwan.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/p-500-gain-over-8-124009242.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 4:40 AM","By Caroline Valetkevitch NEW YORK (Reuters) - The S&P 500 will rise over 8% between now and end-2025 as U.S. interest rate cuts and potentially less regulation under President-elect Donald Trump extend the market's strong run, according to a Reuters poll of equity strategists. Continued U.S. economic health will boost earnings growth, and some strategists cited financials as among their top sector picks going into 2025, partly because of prospects for deregulation under Trump. Some market participants expect Trump's agenda of tax cuts and deregulation will propel economic growth and further gains in the market. The benchmark S&P 500 will end 2025 at 6,500 points, according to the median forecast of 48 equity strategists, analysts, brokers and portfolio managers collected Nov. 15-26. That's up about 8.5% from its 5,987.37 close on Monday. The latest end-2025 forecast is sharply higher than the 5,900 forecast in a Reuters poll in August. Stocks rallied to record highs following the Nov. 5 presidential election which Republican Trump won, four years after being voted out of the White House. Overall, the S&P 500 has surged about 26% so far in 2024, fueled in part by sharp gains in Nvidia, Microsoft and other U.S. heavyweights dominating the race for artificial intelligence technology. David Kostin, chief U.S. equity strategist at Goldman Sachs, forecast in his recent 2025 equity outlook that the ""Magnificent 7"" group of high-performing stocks - which include Nvidia and Microsoft - are likely to outperform next year but ""by a much smaller magnitude."" He sees higher earnings growth overall for the S&P 500 pushing the index to 6,500 by the end of next year. Analysts expect earnings growth of 14.2% in 2025 for the entire S&P 500, up from 10.2% this year, according to LSEG. Following this year's rally, the S&P 500 is trading at 22.6 times expected earnings, compared with a 10-year average of about 18, according to LSEG. ""We're not concerned about valuations"" because of the expected growth in earnings and the economy, Mary Ann Bartels, chief investment strategist at Sanctuary Wealth said. Also, she said, the Trump administration may be positive for business. Worries remain over a potential inflationary rebound, which would change how much the Federal Reserve is able to keep cutting rates. The Fed embarked on its policy easing cycle with a large half-percentage-point rate cut in September, its first reduction in borrowing costs since 2020. Some of Trump's plans, especially those for higher tariffs, could drive up consumer prices. On Monday, Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, pledged big tariffs on the United States' three largest trading partners - Canada, Mexico and China. Turmoil in the Middle East is also still a concern for investors. When asked whether a stock market correction of at least 10% is likely early next year, eight of 17 poll participants who answered an additional question said it is likely and two said it is highly likely. Six said it was unlikely and one said highly unlikely. Among sectors, financials are up about 35% for the year to date, leading gains among S&P 500 sectors, with technology up 33%. Bank stocks have benefited in part from prospects for increased merger activity. Deutsche Bank strategists wrote in an outlook report this week they remain overweight financials ""where a multitude of tailwinds are converging.""

As a result, Nvidia's data center revenue generated triple-digit percentage growth in each of the last six quarters.

Meanwhile, he also bought 2.5 million shares of Pinterest (NYSE: PINS), a company that has partnered with Amazon and Alphabet's Google to boost ad demand on its social platform.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/watch-tesla-price-levels-stock-134331674.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 5:43 AM","Tesla shares were little changed early Tuesday after falling 4% yesterday amid uncertainty over new California electric vehicle tax credits and bearish commentary from analysts at UBS. The stock's recent bullish price momentum may have temporarily hit the skids after the shares initially climbed to their highest level in more than two years on Monday before undergoing an intraday reversal to close near the day’s low. Investors should watch key support levels on Tesla's chart around $310 and $265, while watching a bullish bars pattern price target near $500. Tesla (TSLA) shares were little changed early Tuesday after falling 4% yesterday amid uncertainty over new California electric vehicle (EV) tax credits and bearish commentary from analysts at UBS. On Monday, California Governor Gavin Newsom said that the state would provide EV tax credits if the Trump administration removed them at the federal level. However, Newsom added that the rebates would promote innovation and competition in the zero emission vehicle (ZEV) market, suggesting that they would apply to smaller EV makers than Tesla. Sentiment may have also taken a dent yesterday after UBS analyst Joseph Spak said in a research note that the stock’s recent post-election run up had been driven by “animal spirits,” rather than fundamental changes at the company. Tesla shares have surged around 35% since election day, with investors betting that CEO Elon Musk’s close relationship with the President elect will benefit the automaker, possibly through eased self-driving regulations. The stock was up slightly at around $339 in recent premarket trading Tuesday. Below, we take a closer look at the technicals on Tesla's chart and identify important price levels worth watching out for. After breaking out from an ascending triangle earlier this month following Donald Trump’s election victory, Tesla shares trended higher for about a week before consolidating in a pennant, a chart pattern that signals a continuation of the stock’s current uptrend. However, Tesla’s recent bullish price momentum may have temporarily hit the skids after the shares initially climbed to their highest level in more than two years on Monday before undergoing an intraday reversal to close near the day’s low. Moreover, the relative strength index (RSI) turned lower to form a head and shoulders-like topping pattern on the indicator. Let’s use technical analysis to locate key support levels on Tesla’s chart that investors may watch during a pullback and forecast a bullish price target to monitor if the stock resumes its move higher. Firstly, it’s worth keeping an eye on the $310 level, a location on the chart where the shares could attract buying interest near the low of the pennant pattern. A breakdown below this level could see the shares fall to around $265. This area — around 22% below Monday’s closing price — would likely encounter significant support from the ascending triangle’s top trendline, a region that currently sits in close proximity to the rising 50-day moving average. To forecast a bullish target, investors can use a bars pattern, a chart-based technique that analyzes prior price bars to predict future moves. When applying this tool to Tesla’s chart, we take the trending price bars that immediately preceded the pennant and reposition them from the pattern’s top trendline. Doing so projects a target of around $500, the price the stock may reach if a bullish continuation move plays out.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-things-know-stock-market-130640237.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 5:06 AM","News of the day for Nov. 26, 2024 ANGELA WEISS / AFP via Getty Images President-elect Donald Trump says he would enact a 25% tariff on products from Mexico and Canada on his first day in office, as well as 10% tariffs on Chinese-made products; U.S. stock futures are little changed as investors digest the tariffs vow; Kohl's (KSS) stock is sinking on weak results and news its CEO will be stepping down; Zoom Communications (ZM) shares are down despite better-than-expected quarterly results; and Intel (INTC) receives nearly $7.9 billion in CHIPS Act funding but Qualcomm reportedly has cooled on the idea of acquiring the chipmaker. Here's what investors need to know today. President-elect Donald Trump said he would impose tariffs on products coming into the country from Mexico, Canada, and China, reflecting his intention to fulfill a campaign promise. In a post on his Truth social media site, Trump said on Jan. 20, 2025, the first day of his presidency, he would sign an executive order to impose a 25% tariff on all products coming into the U.S. from Mexico and Canada, citing high levels of illegal immigration and drug trafficking. In a separate post, he said he would enact a 10% tariff on Chinese-made goods, but did not specify a timeline for implementing that levy on imports. U.S. stock futures are little changed as investors digest potential economic changes that could come from Trump's announcement on tariffs, which some believe could help increase inflation. The flat early performance follows a session where markets continued their post-election rally, including a record-high close for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, whose futures are ticking lower. Futures for the Nasdaq and S&P 500 are up about 0.3% each. Yields on the 10-year Treasury note are little changed, remaining below the 4.3% level. Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is down more than 1%, trading around the $92,000 price level after stepping back from recent highs. Kohl's (KSS) stock is plummeting 16% in premarket trading after it reported weaker-than-expected third-quarter earnings Tuesday, the day after it announced that Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Tom Kingsbury would stepping down after less than two years running the struggling retailer. Kingsbury, who was named CEO in February 2023, will leave his post on Jan. 15 and be replaced by Ashley Buchanan, CEO of The Michaels Companies. The department store chain reported profit of $22 million on revenue of $3.51 billion, while analysts polled by Visible Alpha were looking for $29.8 million and $3.85 billion, respectively. Zoom Communications (ZM) stock is sinking 9% in premarket trading even though the remote video communication company posted better-than-expected results for the third quarter. The company reported year-over-year revenue growth of 4% to $1.18 billion, above Visible Alpha consensus, while its net income of $207.1 million or 66 cents per share also topped estimates. Zoom raised its full-year outlook for revenue and adjusted earnings per share (EPS), and also reported adding new customers. It also announced its name has changed to Zoom Communications from Zoom Video Communications as it focuses more on artificial intelligence (AI). Intel (INTC) announced it would receive nearly $7.9 billion in government funding as part of a grant from the CHIPS and Science Act.

The company is also pledging to aid in the recovery of small- and medium-size businesses impacted by Hurricanes Helene and Milton in the Southeast. Jessica Ling, executive vice president of global brand advertising at American Express, told WWD that Small Business Saturday was started in 2010 after the U.S. financial crisis of 2008 as a way to drive more foot traffic to SMBs. “Since then, it has continued to evolve to meet the needs of the moment — whether that’s coming out of a financial crisis, navigating a pandemic, adapting to social media marketing or rebuilding after natural disasters like the recent hurricanes in the Southeast.” More from WWD Gen Z Leads in Favoring 'Pay Later' Options for Personal Spending This Holiday Season Holiday Shoppers Are Looking Out for AI-powered Scams and Deepfakes as More Admit Falling Victim Despite Consumers Pulling Back on Holiday Shopping, Small Business Sentiment Remains Upbeat Ling said the company continues to focus on its Small Business Saturday efforts to “remind people of the real impact their dollars make in local communities.” Ahead of this day celebrating the Shop Small movement, Amex released a survey titled “2024 American Express Shop Small Impact Study” looking at how small businesses rely on their communities to be successful and meet financial targets with holiday shopping. The survey was conducted by Teneo on behalf of American Express with more than 1,000 American adults and more than 500 SMB owners in the U.S. Despite 2024 being another tumultuous year in the U.S. with inflation, cost of living and consumer spending downturn, SMB owners are optimistic about their sales for the 2024 holiday season. Ninety-five percent of SMB owners said they are optimistic this season — up from 83 percent for 2023 — with 87 percent predicting stronger holiday sales this year versus last year. Most notably, a majority of SMB owners (84 percent) reported that Small Business Saturday is a critical selling day for their businesses this holiday season. One reason the report’s authors cited consumers looking to support SMBs and local communities being a prime example — many consumers (63 percent) feel a personal connection to their communities when shopping SMBs. “We are looking forward to seeing people across the country get out and support their local businesses this year,” said Ling. “They will also be helping to give back when they do — with Amex donating $1 to hurricane recovery efforts every time a card member uses an eligible American Express card to Shop Small on Small Business Saturday, Nov. 30.” A total of 85 percent of consumers are most likely to Shop Small this holiday season — with 88 percent of Millennials and Generation Z. Amongst those shopping on Small Business Saturday, twice as many Millennials and Gen Z consumers said they plan to spend more this year than last year (52 percent) compared to Gen X/Boomers (26 percent). Consumers reported that they Shop Small to make an impact locally, with 64 percent reporting they shop at SMBs because their purchases directly impact their communities. Sixty-one of consumers are shopping small and need the support this holiday season — with 68 percent of those Millennials and Gen Z. Seventy-five percent of consumers said they view SMBs as essential with 67 percent stating that SMBs are critical to uniting their community and 34 percent of consumers surveyed reporting that shopping small has even inspired them to think about opening their own businesses. One notable finding from the survey is that 90 percent of Millennials and Gen Z said the best way to find a new business is to walk around their local town, as opposed to searching on social media. “Businesses’ online presence will continue to be crucial, but after the pandemic we have seen a shift in younger consumers’ behaviors as they desire more human, face-to-face connections,” said Ling. Curry Hagerty Uflacker, co-owner and chief executive office of Hart Jewelry is one of the Charleston-based businesses Amex has partnered with Amex for Small Business Saturday — she said this has been key to giving their business a platform to share their story and connect with customers during the holiday season. “We believe our customers come to Hart because they desire a unique, intimate shopping experience and niche brands with a point of view,” said Uflacker. “This is especially true when they are making an emotional purchase like personalized jewelry — not merely a transactional one. In a fast-paced retail world where shoppers are completely inundated with seemingly limitless options, our goal is always to retain that relatable, intimate ‘small business’ touch. We hope that our interactive, intimate store experience is the antidote to mass consumption.” Best of WWD The Definitive Timeline for Sean 'Diddy' Combs' Sean John Fashion Brand: Lawsuits, Runway Shows and Who Owns It Now What the Highest-paid CEOs at U.S. Fashion and Retail Companies Make Confidence Holds Up, But How Much Can Consumers Take?

The S&P 500 Index has surged more than 25% in 2024, posting 51 all-time highs, with stock markets from Asia to Europe mostly up. The Aug. 5 scare that sent the VIX for a record jump intraday now looks like just a hiccups. Solid corporate fundamentals, easing inflation and central-bank rate cuts have helped global shares reach fresh records, while optimism about artificial intelligence keeps lifting the biggest companies. France’s CAC 40 Index is one of the rare developed-market gauges heading for a drop this year after President Emmanuel Macron dissolved parliament and lost his relative majority. “The level of the VIX largely reflects the macroeconomic uncertainty embedded in the economy,” said Garrett DeSimone, head quant at OptionMetrics. “With the exception of a few blips, we have not experienced a sustained liquidity crisis posing systemic risks to the economy, which would be a major driver for above-average VIX levels.” The distribution of returns in the S&P 500 paints the picture of a year with little panic or hasty risk reduction. Daily swings — both up and down — didn’t lead to strong outliers, with most price action staying within the norm. The correction in the summer, caused by forced de-risking amid a sudden change in the economic outlook and rates narrative, was an exception, and investors quickly bought the dip. Growing options activity has also helped serve as a market stabilizer, keeping spikes brief. Exchange-traded funds with embedded options-selling strategies have added $30 billion this year, reaching more than $92 billion in assets under management, according to Nomura Holdings Inc. Moreover, investors are increasingly using ultra short-term options, known as 0-DTE, to hedge for specific risk events, helping keep longer-term volatility at bay. “From a technical standpoint, correlations have been low, with some of the low volatility attributed to funds engaging in yield capture through covered call strategies,” DeSimone said.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spain-looks-big-private-equity-125159660.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 4:51 AM","(Bloomberg) -- Bankers are pinning their hopes on a few large private equity-backed listings to rekindle Spain’s IPO market next year, after several candidates postponed plans to go public in recent months blaming tough market conditions. Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field NYC's Underground Steam System May Be Key to a Greener Future NYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge Casino operator Cirsa Enterprises, owned by Blackstone Inc., and travel technology firm HBX Group, backed by Cinven and CPP Investments, are planning to launch their initial public offerings in the first half of 2025, which could raise in the range of €1 billion ($1.1 billion) each, Bloomberg has reported. If successful, the floats, coupled with decreasing interest rates and returning equity inflows, could pave the way for others to follow suit. “That makes the environment more attractive for issuers to come to market in 2025, as long as they can demonstrate financial momentum,” said Salvatore Branca, head of equity capital markets for Southern Europe at BNP Paribas SA. After a quiet few years, 2024 was tipped to be a watershed for Spanish listings spearheaded by Puig Brands SA’s €2.6 billion IPO in May, the country’s largest for nearly a decade. But things haven’t turned out exactly as hoped. Shares in Puig, the owner of beauty brands Rabanne and Charlotte Tilbury, have struggled to recover from disappointing earnings in September and are down 19% since listing. Water and energy utility Cox Abg Group SA has been fluctuating around the price of its downsized IPO. Other local firms have put their listing ambitions on ice, including bakery group Europastry SA, fashion retailer Tendam and Bergé y Compañía unit Astara. Donald Trump’s imminent return to the White House adds a further layer of complexity for companies weighing IPOs. Investors are concerned about some of the US president-elect’s policy plans, including the potential risks for global trade patterns from his threatened tariffs. “The geopolitical context and uncertainties do not help,” said Alvaro Castro, head of equity primary market at Spanish exchange operator Bolsas y Mercados Españoles. Even so, Castro said he remained “reasonably optimistic” about the IPO outlook, given the number of companies that attempted going public this year and the others waiting in the wings. “The important thing is the long term and that companies understand, as they increasingly do, that being listed on the stock exchange brings reputation and visibility to companies,” he said. Valuation Matters Dealmakers are looking to the US for signs of a pick up in IPO activity, with history suggesting that increased American deal volumes are likely to be followed by the rest of the world. Spain may be better positioned than some European neighbors to ride that wave, according to Andre Pereira-Ambrosio, head of ECM for Iberia at Alantra Partners SA. Spain’s economy, hit hard by Covid-19, is on track to grow 3% in 2024 and 2.3% next year, ahead of the euro zone, according to European Union forecasts. Meanwhile, the Spanish IBEX 35 stock index is up around 15% year to date, outpacing the regional Stoxx 600 benchmark. This doesn’t mean the doors will open widely to all IPO candidates. “Mid-to-large cap companies with unique stories will be able to go public under favorable conditions, while small-cap candidates will continue to face challenges,” Alantra’s Pereira-Ambrosio said. “For these smaller companies to access the market, they will have to be more flexible with their valuation expectations.” Indeed, the mismatch in valuation expectations between issuers and investors has been a hurdle to deal activity, and will remain so unless sellers — in particular private equity firms — are able to compromise on price, according to Roberto Scholtes, head of strategy at wealth manager Singular Bank. “The inflection point could rather come from more pressured PE funds asking for lower valuations,” he said. Still, if economic and geopolitical risks wane, and provided transactions come at attractive prices, Spain should see a “more favorable” environment for IPOs, said Natalia Aguirre, head of research and strategy at Madrid-based Renta 4.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily BioPharma Dive newsletter. Amgen on Tuesday said its weight loss drug MariTide helped people with obesity lose up to 20% of their body weight over one year in a Phase 2 trial, paving the way for the company to initiate a larger study aimed at supporting U.S. approval. The weight loss Amgen reported for its monthly shot appeared to be “in line” with the popular obesity drugs Zepbound and Wegovy, Wall Street analysts said. However, the rate of trial participants discontinuing MariTide appeared higher than what was reported in testing for those weekly medicines, sold by Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk. Amgen’s study was among the most closely-watched in the obesity field this year, with investors driving company shares up on their high expectations for MariTide, or maridebart cafraglutide. Amgen’s stock fell by double digits in morning trading Tuesday. “Bulls will be a little disappointed today,” Jefferies analyst Michael Yee wrote in a client note. Billions of dollars worth of investment have flowed into obesity drug research over the past two years, drawn by the success of Wegovy and Zepbound as well as forecasts that have predicted $100 billion or more in annual sales for obesity and diabetes drugs that target GLP-1. Both Wegovy and Zepbound have already established dominant market positions, though. Ozempic, a diabetes drug that has the same active ingredient as Wegovy and is often prescribed off-label for weight loss, is now consumer shorthand for the new obesity shots. Moreover, Novo and Lilly have data showing Wegovy and Zepbound can help in associated conditions, which have helped expand payer coverage. Wegovy gained FDA approval to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and complications in people with obesity and established heart disease, which won it limited Medicare coverage. Meanwhile, Zepbound has shown it helps people with obesity who also have sleep apnea or heart failure. Complicating Amgen’s chances of competing further, both Novo and Lilly have succesor obesity drugs in Phase 3 development that, if successful in the clinic, could reach the market before MariTide. Like dozens of other companies, Amgen is trying to elbow its way in. Similar to Wegovy and Zepbound, MariTide stimulates GLP-1, a gut hormone regulating appetite and satiety. It also acts on a second hormone called GIP, but instead of stimulating it as Zepbound does, MariTide inhibits it. Amgen didn’t disclose full details from MariTide’s Phase 2 trial, which evaluated several doses of the drug, indicating that more would be revealed at future medical meetings and in peer-reviewed journals. The trial enrolled 465 people with obesity or who were overweight, and randomized them to take a placebo, one of four monthly fixed MariTide doses, one eight week fixed dose or one of two “escalation” regimens up to the maximum dose. It also enrolled 127 people with obesity or who were overweight and also had Type 2 diabetes, which researchers then randomized to take a placebo or monthly fixed-dose arms. Amgen reported weight loss from treatment of up to 20% over 52 weeks for trial participants without diabetes who received MariTide, and up to 17% for those with diabetes. The drug also lowered blood sugar levels for the people with diabetes who took it. Around 11% of people in the dose escalation arms dropped out because of side effects, which is higher than the 7% recorded in Phase 3 trials of Zepbound. Based on the Phase 2 data, MariTide’s main differentiation appears to be its less frequent dosing, Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger wrote in a note to clients. Yee, meanwhile, wrote that the MariTide is “more or less similar” to Zepbound on weight loss. Analysts at Piper Sandler took a more positive view of the data, noting that it suggests MariTide appears to match Zepbound’s weight loss more quickly. “A number of questions remain, but we see a drug that provides equivalent weight loss to tirzepatide much faster ... with monthly dosing ... albeit with a key safety tradeoff,” wrote the bank’s Christopher Raymond in a client note. On Tuesday, Amgen said it would start a Phase 3 clinical program of MariTide, which will include trials in people with obesity and heart disease, sleep apnea, kidney disorders and other conditions related to obesity.

Now it has a new mandate to pare that stake, valued at roughly $50 billion, and diversify into a range of assets. So far this year, that has meant starting a money-management arm and attracting talent from some of Canada’s biggest pension plans. Now, Mastercard Foundation Asset Management Corp., which debuted this year, is buying private equity stakes for a discount. The board of Eastman Kodak Co.’s pension plan agreed to sell private equity ownership interests and other illiquid assets valued at $764.4 million to the Mastercard Foundation for $550.6 million, according to a regulatory filing. The sale is expected to be completed at year-end. MFAM’s board features a roster of big names in Canadian finance, including Lynn Patterson, a former Bank of Canada deputy governor, and Jim Leech, who was chief executive officer of Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan for more than six years until retiring about a decade ago. The asset manager’s chief investment officer is John Barker, who previously held that role for more than a decade at health-care system Mass General Brigham. Before that, he was a managing director at Harvard Management Co. Toronto-based MFAM has been on an expansion drive and building out its team, attracting employees from OTPP and other Canadian pension plans. Its leaders include Chief Technology Officer Dan Houle and Danilo Simonelli, who joined as managing director after almost 20 years at Ontario Teachers’. MFAM is currently Mastercard’s biggest shareholder, with a stake of about 10%. Barker plans to diversify the portfolio over the next seven years, unloading 13% to 15% of Mastercard stock each year. MFAM will initially partner with third-party managers before considering direct investment, Barker said in a May interview. The shares, donated to the foundation around the time of Mastercard’s 2006 initial public offering, have climbed more than 13,000% since then, making it one of the S&P 500’s best performers in that span. The foundation’s charitable efforts include working to help young people in Africa and indigenous children in Canada.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-investing-trends-2025-15-100000718.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 2:00 AM","Picking stocks is about predicting the future. As investors can tell you, being early to spot a trend and betting on a company poised to ride it can translate to a handsome return. Those who bought Amazon in 1998, for example, or Tesla in 2012, or Nvidia in 2020 correctly foresaw the respective explosions of online shopping, EVs, and the AI revolution—and made out like bandits. Of course, this isn’t easy to do. One issue is timing. A thesis about the future of a sector might be correct, but it may still be years away. Betting on the right sector but the wrong horse can also be painful, as investors in bankrupt EV maker Fisker or fallen chip giant Intel can attest. In the past, a relatively safe way to invest in macro trends has been to buy so-called cyclical stocks (think travel or entertainment) when the economy is on an upswing, and defensive ones (think consumer staples) when times are bad. Today, though, broader forces like tech transformation and geopolitical upheaval have made this model less reliable. In recent years, for example, utility stocks—a classic defensive play—have been on a tear, while the dominance of the tech-heavy group of stocks known as the Magnificent Seven has been a bigger story than any discrepancy between cyclical and defensive stocks. The investment landscape may grow more unpredictable still as Donald Trump prepares his return to the White House. Nonetheless, Fortune’s finance team put our heads together to come up with stock ideas for the coming year. We began by identifying five trends, and then picking three companies set to ride each of those waves in 2025. In some cases, our picks reflect the ongoing march of technology. Other trends such as geopolitical risk—named by CEOs in a recent Deloitte-Fortune survey as having the biggest potential to create disruption—and health and wellness reflect broader political and social shifts. Finally, markets are unpredictable, so treat the stock picks noted here not as advice, but as a departure point for your own research into which companies might shine in the coming year. —Jeff John Roberts In recent years, the world has become more dangerous as war has broken out in the Middle East and on Europe’s doorstep in Ukraine, while tensions remain high in the Taiwan Strait. According to the think tank Institute for Economics & Peace, there are currently 56 armed conflicts around the globe, the highest number since World War II. Meanwhile, numerous reports show a year-over-year double-digit increase in cyberattacks, as bandits and national armies seek to steal data and wreak havoc. These trends are worrisome but also present an opportunity for investors. The conflicts around the globe have produced a shortage of weapons, particularly missiles and missile defense, making companies that cater to militaries a good bet for 2025. Ron Epstein, a senior analyst at Bank of America, says the U.S. is expected to spend around $1 trillion on defense next year, and that he has buy ratings on all the major companies in the sector. But he singled out RTX (ticker RTX) as occupying a particularly strong position thanks to its Raytheon division’s “fantastic missile franchise” and because its military business is complemented by a successful commercial aircraft unit. Those with qualms about investing in weapons may prefer to put their money into the cybersecurity sector instead. There are a host of publicly traded companies that tout their ability to protect networks and thwart cyberattacks, including the growing number of attacks generated by AI. But performance across the sector has been uneven, as underscored by CrowdStrike, which issued a faulty update in July that grounded Delta’s fleet of planes and cost the airline and other clients billions of dollars One cyber company on an upswing is Fortinet (FTNT), based in Sunnyvale, Calif., with well over $5 billion in annual revenue. Like others in the sector, it does not issue dividends and has a fairly high P/E ratio. At the same time, Fortinet’s share price has handily outperformed the broader market and most of its peers. Founded in 2000, the company is a trusted name in the industry and offers a wide variety of services, catering to a range of sectors such as finance, health care, education, and government. Some investors who foresee global turmoil roiling markets may prefer to avoid individual company stocks altogether, and bet instead on volatility and uncertainty itself. While there are ETFs that loosely track the so-called VIX fear gauge, such plays are for sophisticated, active investor and don’t belong in a buy-and-hold portfolio. A better option for those betting on ongoing turmoil is old-fashioned gold—specifically, through an ETF like SPDR Gold Shares (GLD) that permits you to hold the yellow metal at a reasonable cost. While GLD prices sank in November after the election of Donald Trump, many expect the ETF to continue its recent strong run. Goldman Sachs predicts gold will reach more than $3,000 an ounce in 2025, as conflict and trouble keep the world on edge. —J.J.R. This year has not been kind to the luxury sector. The share prices of upscale companies like Burberry Group, Kering, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, and Movado are all down year to date. This is the result of Americans tightening their purse strings, but also because Chinese consumers—one of the luxury sector’s most important pillars—are feeling pinched by the country’s real estate crisis. But all this offers an opportunity for the discerning investor, says Jelena Sokolova, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar. For the past 30 years, data shows that a luxury down cycle hasn’t lasted more than one to three years—pointing to how high-end consumers can’t stay away from the finer things in life for long. Typically, the industry bounces back quite strongly after those downturns,” says Sokolova. “For a long term perspective, I think there is still potential there.” For the best bets in the luxury space, long-term brand preservation is everything, says Deiya Pernas, cofounder of Pernas Research. Whether the brand “stays true to its heritage” is a key differentiator in this sector, he says, as is its ability to expand its offerings into new categories. According to Sokolova, one brand well poised for a luxury market rebound is Prada (PRDSY), thanks in part to Miu Miu, its stylish sister brand and an up-and-coming industry power player. Its popularity among younger consumers—including those likely to benefit from an upcoming massive intergenerational wealth transfer—has helped the Italian fashion house defy the larger luxury downturn, as Miu Miu notched an eye-popping 105% year-over-year increase in retail sales in the third quarter, to around $347 million. Meanwhile, revenues for the larger Prada fashion group were up in nine months to $4.1 billion, an 18% jump. Another standout in the sector is ultra-luxury brand Hermès (HESAY), whose clientele consists of the 1% of the 1%, and which has been largely insulated from the slump that has seen the share price of rival LVMH fall over 10% year to date. The French-listed Hermès, in contrast, has reported double-digit sales growth every quarter this year. While other luxury brands have been disproportionately affected by slipping sales from their aspirational client segments, Hermès has more customers than it can materially accommodate: The wait lists for its most-sought-after products, the $10,000-plus Birkin and Kelly handbags, continue to grow, as the world’s wealthiest clamor for something they can’t simply walk in and buy off the shelf. Meanwhile, shares of Hermès competitor Kering (KER.PA) are down over 40% year-to-date but analysts expect a bounceback, making this luxury brand a potential bargain. —Alicia Adamczyk The world is consuming more energy than ever—and the trend is going in only one direction. Consider that a single Google search consumes 0.3 watt-hours of electricity, according to the International Energy Agency, but a similar query on OpenAI takes 2.9 wh. And then there are electric cars and our growing collection of always-on gadgets, which contributed to a global record for energy consumption last year, according to the Energy Institute. Powering all this is an increasingly diverse set of energy sources—all of which offer opportunities for investors in 2025. In a sign of the times, the AI boom is poised to resurrect Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania, the site of the worst nuclear accident in U.S. history. The plant’s owner, Constellation Energy (CEG), will spend $1.6 billion over the next four years to restart its undamaged Unit 1 reactor, betting that nuclear has the potential to deliver a massive revenue boost. The bet looks promising, as the company has already signed a deal with Microsoft to supply the software giant’s data centers with nuclear power for at least the next 20 years. The share price of Constellation, America’s largest owner of nuclear plants, has more than doubled this year. Wall Street expects the company to post yearly earnings growth of 30% for 2024, while Visible Alpha predicts free cash flows could reach $1.5 billion. Building new plants is a regulatory nightmare, notes CFRA Research’s Daniel Reuven Rich, which gives existing operators an advantage. “They’re the only game in town,” he says, and it’s become a lucrative one. A thousand miles south, and 250 miles off the coast of New Orleans, the oil and gas company TechnipFMC (FTI) is building an elaborate network of manifolds and umbilical cords for between $250 million and $500 million to help oil giant BP extract 80,000 barrels of oil a day. Last quarter alone, the U.K.-incorporated company doing business from Houston secured $2.5 billion in subsea orders, adding to a backlog of $14.7 billion. Shareholders received $394 million in dividends and share buybacks in the first nine months of 2024 alone. But ATB Capital Markets analyst Waqar Syed says that’s only the beginning. Even as the company is projected to pull in around $9 billion in annual revenue, Syed says the backlog means not all the cash has been counted. “Orders are coming in at a much higher rate than the revenues are,” he says. “At some point their revenue is going to catch up.” Syed predicts FTI’s future cash flows will increase 76% in 2025 to $859.2 million, and the company has committed to return at least 60% of its future cash flow to shareholders. Looking abroad, it may be a good time to consider Spanish energy giant Iberdrola (IBDRY). Through its public U.S. subsidiary, Avangrid, it has doubled down on its renewable investments in the U.S., particularly with offshore wind. The company has pumped a combined $13.28 billion into projects in America and the U.K. over the past year, helping drive a 50% boost in net income through the first nine months of 2024. —Michael del Castillo and Greg Mckenna Since the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022, the explosive demand for artificial intelligence has driven a broader stock market boom. Public companies directly tied to the field have seen their market caps skyrocket, while industries even tangentially related to AI—such as the once-unloved utility sector—have enjoyed a bump. Given all the hype, skeptical investors may fear the sector has crossed the line from boom to bubble, but many analysts say AI stocks still have room to run. Starting with pure plays, it’s hard to bet against the company at the heart of the AI boom: Nvidia (NVDA). There is a ravenous appetite for its flagship GPU chips from a wide variety of companies scrambling to keep pace in the AI era. One analyst closely following the company, CFRA Research’s Angelo Zino, said that Nvidia’s total addressable market is only set to expand. Its sales totaled $30 billion last quarter, up 122% from a year ago, and Zino expects the figure to surge upwards of $50 billion in two years’ time. He expects quarterly free cash flow to soon exceed that of every firm but Apple. It also stands to reason that Nvidia’s most deep-pocketed customers are the best positioned to make the necessary capital expenditures. “The big are only going to get bigger,” says Baird’s Ted Mortonson. “The monopolies are going to get more monopolistic.” Even among the giants of Big Tech, Microsoft (MSFT) is the leading high roller, with Bloomberg Intelligence projecting the company’s capital outlay could hit $53 billion this year. That capex is already generating sales, according to CEO Satya Nadella, who says Microsoft's AI business is on track to surpass an annual revenue run rate of $10 billion. Microsoft has invested $14 billion alone in OpenAI since 2019—the main reason Mortonson believes the Seattle-based cloud titan is the best pick among the traditional tech outfits. Shares recently had their worst day in two years after the company forecast cloud growth to slow next quarter, presenting a potential opportunity to “buy the dip.” That may also be the case in application software, a sector yet to realize the benefits of AI. Salesforce (CRM) has been far from a Wall Street darling recently, with the stock trailing the S&P 500 and posting revenue growth in the single digits. Zino, however, believes the company is well positioned to deliver on so-called agentic AI—think autonomous digital assistants that put generative AI into action. “We think by the end of 2025 there are going to be a lot of investors that really kind of warm up to the Salesforce story,” Zino said. Not everyone agrees. Mortonson, for example, prefers cloud computing platform ServiceNow, which benefits from a close partnership with Nvidia. For those who believe in Salesforce’s long-term AI prospects, however, buying now could prove a bargain. —Leo Schwartz and G.M. According to a report by the Sports & Fitness Industry Association, the number of people getting active has increased every year for a decade. The report adds that threefourths of the U.S. population, or 242 million people, participated in at least one sports or fitness activity in 2023, a 2.2% bump from 2022. For investors looking to capitalize on this trend, the sporting-goods sector is a solid bet. According to David Swartz, a Morningstar senior equity analyst, the field includes names like Adidas, Lululemon, Under Armour, and Puma. But he says one company stands out above the others. “Nike (NKE) has a closer relationship with global and American sports than any other company,” Swartz tells Fortune. Nike’s stock has been pummeled this year over strategic missteps, including a failure to develop new products and a disastrous decision to favor direct-to-consumer distribution. But Morningstar believes it is now undervalued compared with its long-term fair value estimate of $117 per share. Morningstar forecasts compound average sales growth of 5% over the next 10 years, and expects Nike will achieve compound annual revenue growth of 2% in North America. Nike’s stock hit an all-time high of $177.51 in November 2021, but has since dropped by almost 50%. Swartz believes the company is poised for a comeback now that longtime Nike exec Elliott Hill is at the helm—he returned in October—and that Nike “will benefit from the growth of sports, both in the U.S. and globally.” Alongside the trend in increased physical activity is a new focus on self-care. This includes technology that identifies health risks for women, including breast cancer detection. A leading player in the field is Hologic (HOLX), a health care company with around $4 billion in annual revenue that provides 3D mammography technology. It has an 80%-plus share of the U.S. mammography imaging market and 30% internationally, according to Andrew Brackmann, a William Blair equity research analyst. Hologic, which has about 7,000 employees, also offers a range of tests for sexually transmitted infections as well as COVID-19. Since 2021, Hologic has scooped up seven companies and grown earnings at a roughly 10% compound annual growth rate over the past decade, Brackmann tells Fortune. Hologic’s stock is up about 16% this year. The growing field of prenatal diagnosis also offers an opportunity for investors, especially as preterm births in the U.S. have jumped by more than 10% in the past decade. In this field, Brackmann recommends a small firm called Sera Prognostics (SERA), which has created a blood test, called PreTRM, that helps identify which women may deliver prematurely. “There is a massive market need,” he says. Sera, which employs around 63 people, went public in 2021 but has never traded at or near its $16 IPO price. In August, Sera said it plans to publish the results of its PRIME study for the PreTRM test in the spring of 2025. Sera hasn’t gotten much traction with doctors, who have asked for more data, Brackmann says. “When the publication comes out it will generate a lot of buzz,” he notes. He expects Sera, which currently has negligible revenue, to bring in more than $100 million over the next three to five years. —Sheryl Estrada and Luisa Beltran At a time when the country was reeling from soaring prices, Fortune set about to pick 13 “inflation-proof” stocks. How did we do? In the 12 months since we published in November 2023, the benchmark S&P 500 delivered a 34% total return. Our portfolio: 51%. That’s not to say all our picks were winners. Two were blockbusters: chip darling Nvidia (total return, 193%) and big data company Palantir (179%). Other outperformers included e-commerce giant Mercado Libre and hefty dividend payers Kinder Morgan (pipelines) and Boston Properties (real estate). The other eight trailed the S&P, though none delivered negative returns. (Procter & Gamble, the worst performer, still gained 6%.) But overall, the home runs far outweighed the strikeouts. —Matt Heimer This article appears in the December 2024/January 2025 edition of Fortune with the headline ""5 trends for 2025 and how to invest in them.""

The decision follows an annoucement from ICE that it is launching a similar product next month. It’s a change of tack for Eurex, which just weeks ago said it was too early to introduce a contract in 2024 as originally planned. Back then, it said a “key” pre-requisite for such a product is that the EU bond program becomes sustainable and of long-term nature beyond 2026. The bloc only started ramping up debt issuance after the pandemic and currently has no plans to issue bonds that increase its debt load beyond 2026. But the Eurex decision is a welcome development for the EU regardless, which has touted a futures market as a way of boosting trading in its bonds. “The market for EU bonds is continuously developing in terms of depth and liquidity,” the Eurex statement said. “Secondary market trading in EU-Bonds is on a par with some of the largest sovereign issuers.” The EU is looking to improve the liquidity of its bonds with the aim of ultimately achieving lower borrowing costs. That’s included the introduction of a repo facility in October, enticing banks to provide better quotes on its bonds, and lobbying index providers for inclusion in their larger sovereign-debt benchmarks. Bond investors often use futures to hedge their portfolios and all major European sovereign debt issuers including Germany, France and Italy have such markets. Still, it’s not guaranteed that either Eurex’s or ICE’s contracts will attract sufficient volumes.

The tech platform helps bring origination costs down, Pylon’s chief executive officer and founder, Trent Hedge, said in an interview. Citi will be able to buy Pylon mortgages through its trading desk, subject to certain underwriting criteria, Patrick Brett, the head of Citi’s Spread Products Investments Technologies unit, said in an interview. The bank then has the option to either sell them or package them into mortgage-backed securities. The deal will also allow Pylon clients access to Citi’s products and rates and potentially the trading desk’s liquidity. Financial terms of the investment were not disclosed. The deal comes as US homebuyers face persistently high borrowing costs, which has led to a slowdown in home sales over the last couple of years. The average 30-year mortgage rate was 6.9% as of Nov. 15, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association, up about 40 basis points from a month prior. “The consumer attitude has changed, more borrowers are using point of sale loans,” Brett said. “Pylon is extending that into the mortgage market.” “Our connectivity with Citi’s mortgage trading desk delivers the same unobstructed access to Wall Street that was previously only available to the largest market participants,” Hedge said in the statement. Citi made the investment through its SPRINT unit and Citi Ventures, according to the statement.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-uber-bull-tom-123000410.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 4:30 AM","(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street prognosticators tend to huddle around the consensus, afraid to stand out for fear of being wrong. Then there’s Tom Lee. Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field NYC's Underground Steam System May Be Key to a Greener Future NYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge The chief investment officer at Fundstrat Capital has made his name with bold calls (the S&P 500 at 15,000; Bitcoin to $10 million). His unabashedly bullish takes, for which he makes no apologies, have drawn legions of online followers in this anything-goes era of market speculation — fueled by do-it-yourself retail investors. Now, the former JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategist is looking to cash in on his renown with a new exchange-traded fund, the Granny Shots US Large Cap ETF (ticker GRNY), which launched earlier this month and has already raked in more than $400 million. It’s the first of what he hopes will be many to follow. The fund’s name, like the list of equity recommendations Lee has provided clients since 2019, is derived from an unconventional basketball free-throw style he likens to his systematic, theme-based stock-picking process. It may not look the coolest, Lee says, but it has the highest chance of success. “Our clients and their loyalty and the fact that we’re still growing really rapidly as a research firm is not just because we’re bulls,” Lee said in an interview, adding the firm has a dedicated institutional following as well. “It’s because we’ve given them many reasons to understand why markets should do what they’re doing.” The ETF is off to a strong start. GRNY is up 2.2% since its early November launch, compared to a 0.2% advance for the S&P 500 over the same span. Its $412 million of inflows puts it in the top 10% of fund debuts this year based on speed of asset accumulation, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. Still, GRNY is launching amid a difficult run for stock pickers. Roughly two-thirds of large cap managers have underperformed the S&P 500 this year through the end of October, data from Strategas Research show. In fact, more than half of active managers have trailed the benchmark in 14 of the last 15 years. Thematic ETFs have also fallen out of favor recently, with outflows in nine out of 10 months this year through October, Bloomberg Intelligence data show. For more, subscribe to the ETF IQ weekly newsletter That won’t deter Lee. GRNY is based on four longer-term themes, including easing financial conditions and global labor suppliers, and three shorter-term ones like seasonality and style tilt. Stocks that aligned with two or more of the themes are included in the fund. Meta Platforms Inc. falls into five themes, for example, while Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Garmin Ltd. fit into four. “It’s not a black box process,” said Lee, who added that he and his team have received positive feedback for their transparency. “Granny Shots is giving people a really good understanding of why they’re owning this.” Top holdings include police and military equipment producer Axon Enterprise Inc., Tesla Inc. and CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. The fund, which consists of some 35 stocks, will be rebalanced quarterly. The themes, too, are dynamic. Being perennially bullish doesn’t always pay off, of course. Both 2018 and 2022 were difficult years for risk assets and, in turn, Lee’s optimistic outlook. Yet last year his S&P 500 forecast was the most accurate among more than 20 Wall Street strategists tracked by Bloomberg as the gauge advanced 24%. This year is likely to be a similar story as the benchmark’s 26% advance has exceeded even the most bullish estimates. He recently told Bloomberg’s Odd Lots podcast that the S&P 500 could hit 15,000 by 2030. When it comes to Bitcoin, he’s been predicting the digital token would hit $100,000 since at least 2018. In February, he forecast the virtual currency would reach $150,000 by year-end, mainly because of a supply-demand imbalance due to a planned reduction in the rewards miners receive, and incoming president Donald Trump’s pledge to set up a national Bitcoin stockpile. Lee, who co-manages the fund with Ken Xuan, is the latest in a growing list of prominent economists and investors to launch ETFs, joining the likes of Nouriel Roubini, Research Affiliates’ Rob Arnott and others. Still, it takes more than just a recognizable name to launch a successful fund, he said. “I don’t think just because someone has a name that suddenly they can put out an ETF and it attracts assets,” Lee said. Ultimately, the plan is for GRNY to be the first of numerous ETFs based on Lee’s investment philosophy. “We’re already planning a full phase of what follows this one,” he said. --With assistance from Lu Wang.

Annual price gains have fallen every month since February as high mortgage rates continue to push payments out of financial reach for many would-be buyers, dampening demand. High prices and mortgage rates have nearly paralyzed the housing market, which has, in recent months, posted the lowest sales figures in decades. Home prices in the U.S. hit another record high in September, though prices didn't accelerate as much as in previous months, as high mortgage rates continued to drag on the housing market.The national S&P Case-Shiller Home Price Index rose 3.9% over 12 months in September, down from a 4.3% increase in August, Dow Jones Indices said Tuesday. The uptick took the index to a fresh record high, although the annual price increases have been getting shallower in recent months. Annual price gains have decelerated every month since February when prices rose 6.5% year-over-year.Rapid increases in home prices since the pandemic, combined with high mortgage rates for the past few years, have pushed monthly mortgage payments out of reach for many buyers and stifled home sales.""Sales prices of existing homes falling is a bit of good news for buyers, and while 2024 will go down as one of the worst years for sales, maybe we’re finally seeing a sustained deceleration in price increases,"" Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union, wrote in a commentary.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/round-one-warning-shot-zzzz-140026711.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 6:00 AM","(Bloomberg) -- Traders got a stark reminder of President-elect Donald Trump’s fly-by-night approach to economic policy Monday night, when he blasted off threats to use steep tariffs against America‘s three biggest trading partners to stop the flow of drugs and migrants into the US. Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field NYC's Underground Steam System May Be Key to a Greener Future NYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge The 6:35 p.m. social media posts jolted traders from their commutes or early dinners in an effort to assess the market impact. Yes, the dollar surged against the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar, and Treasury yields edged higher. And US stock futures, barely positive after another solid day of gains, slipped some. But for so large a risk to global trade, the market reaction was muted and fairly brief. By 8:30 a.m. in New York, S&P 500 contracts were higher and small caps in the Russell 2000 — thought to be winners under a widespread trade war — were trading lower. Wall Street strategists had a quick explanation. It’s just “round one in a long process,” said JonesTrading’s Dave Lutz. “These threats are viewed as warning shots,” said his colleague Mike O’Rourke. Or as Charlie McElligott of Nomura put it: “zzzzzzz.” Shares of General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. fell about 4% and 2%, respectively, due to their exposure to Mexico and China through the automotive supply chain, and an exchange-traded fund filled with Mexican companies slipped. Yet the so-called Wall Street fear gauge, the Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, was little changed and hovered near levels that indicate extreme calm. Here’s what Wall Street pros were saying about the muted reaction in equities: Dave Lutz, equity sales trader and macro strategist at JonesTrading: “It feels like stocks are discounting a lot of the news, thinking that this is round one in a long process before tariffs are ultimately implemented. And that once implemented, they will probably not be as harsh as this.” Dennis Debusschere, founder and chief market strategist at 22V Research: “It’s being viewed as a negotiating tool for now, by linking it to immigration and drugs. That might not be true longer term, but that is how people are thinking about it now.“ Charlie McElligott, cross asset macro strategist at Nomura “This has always been the ‘Art of The Deal’ playbook since Trump 1.0, start high and hard with negotiating leverage and intent… and go from there, which is frankly exactly what Scott Bessent told us over a month ago before the Election—hence, zzzzzzz.” Mike O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading: “These threats are viewed as warning shots to get China, Mexico and Canada to meet expected responsibilities. In the case of Canada and Mexico, it is not too much to ask that they tighten control of the border to prevent illegal crossings. In the case of China, it is failing to meet the responsibilities regarding fentanyl from the agreements made in during the first Trump Administrations. The currency moves are discounting potential risk to Canada and Mexico if they fail execute on their responsibilities. US Investors realize this is not a big ask by Trump. He is willing to use tariffs to prompt China, Mexico and Canada to take actions they have already agreed to.” Kevin Gordon, Senior Investment Strategist, Charles Schwab & Co.: “I think it’s mostly due to the fact that the threats are just threats right now. We have to wait to see what meat will actually be put on the bones after Trump takes office — not to mention the fact that on the other side of the coin is immigration policy. I think it’s plausible to expect him to stick to his word on these proposals, but it will be difficult for the market to price in anything right now, given the uncertain nature of the details and sequencing of these policies.” Joseph Saluzzi, co-head of equity trading at Themis Trading LLC: “The market may view this more as a temporary move since there are strings attached to the move. In other words, maybe the tariffs on Mexico and Canada will only be a short term thing. Also, market has the momentum and it’s a short week, so sometimes it’s tough to break that.” David Lin, founder & CEO at Linvest21: “Markets have become adept at tuning out political noise, particularly tariff threats that lack immediate action or detailed implementation plans. Instead, investors remain focused on economic fundamentals and corporate earnings. Moreover, President Trump’s Treasury Secretary pick, Bessent, has played a calming role. His early comments on a staged implementation of tariffs and his reputation as a steady hand have reassured markets, helping to mitigate volatility and maintain stability.” --With assistance from Natalia Kniazhevich, Alexandra Semenova and Elena Popina.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/compass-point-analyst-sings-praises-105335212.html,"Tue, Nov 26, 2024, 2:53 AM","As we face the likelihood of significant shifts in economic policy under incoming President Trump, it’s time to start taking a closer look at financial stocks. While you might think first of bank stocks, the finance sector includes much more – everything from insurance companies to fintech, and acts as a bellows for the overall economy. Unlock your investing potential with TipRanks Premium - Now At 40% OFF! Make smarter investments with weekly expert stock picks from the Smart Investor Newsletter Trump’s first term saw solid economic growth, sparking high hopes for a repeat in the next few years, and growth is always positive for the banking and financial sector. The conventional wisdom sees the likelihood of growth outweighing the Federal Reserve’s move toward rate cutting, and that finance will see a net positive in the near- to mid-term. This has Compass Point analyst Dominick Gabriele taking a positive look at fintech, the melding of finance and high tech, and telling investors that it’s time to load up on two tech-oriented financial service stocks. According to the TipRanks database, both of these stocks are Buy-rated and have already seen solid growth in recent months; let’s look into the details, and find out why the Compass Point analyst believes that their good times will keep on rolling. Fidelity National Info (FIS) The first stock up, FIS, or Fidelity National Information Services, is one of the finance market’s major tech players. The company acts as a third-party service provider in the financial industry, processing payments and clearing transactions across the financial industry. The company counts more than 5,800 client firms across 150 countries, and services approximately $8 trillion in assets. Fintech isn’t just big business, it’s huge. Overall, the industry is estimated by Mordor Intelligence to reach more than $600 billion by 2029, and Fidelity National Info has leveraged its expertise to generate nearly $10 billion in total revenues last year. The company boasts a market cap exceeding $46 billion. Shares in FIS have outperformed the overall markets in recent months; the stock has gained over 45% year-to-date, compared to the 25% gain on the broader S&P 500 index in the same time period. When we look into FIS’s financial results, last reported for 3Q24, we find that the company reported $2.6 billion in revenue, up 4.4% year-over-year and some $40 million better than had been expected. The non-GAAP EPS figure came to $1.40, 11 cents per share better than the forecast. Looking ahead to the end of the year, FIS has adjusted its full-year revenue forecast upwards to the range of $10.14 billion to $10.17 billion, compared to the consensus estimate of $10.15 billion. The EPS guidance for 2024 was revised upwards to between $5.15 and $5.20, above the $5.13 consensus expectation. For Compass Point’s Dominick Gabriele, this company holds a solid growth position in a growing industry. He writes of the stock, “We expect a return to pre-COVID valuation as banking segment revenue accelerates to 4.4% YoY in 2025 and holds at 4% in 2026. Our analysis inside leads us to believe FIS can meet or exceed consensus EPS expectations in 2025 and 2026 with room to reach 13% EPS growth in a blue sky scenario. FIS continues to beat consensus expectations since 2023, and we believe investors are gaining confidence in FIS’ management team to deliver on financial metrics. We see both revenue and adjusted EPS YoY growth acceleration in 2025 and 2026 as return on invested capital (ROIC) improves.” Gabriele adds, of this stock’s high potential for the near-term, “FIS is traditionally viewed as a defensive stock but given a potential re-rating, we believe FIS’ stock is attractive even as investors search for beta post U.S. presidential election results.” The analyst goes on to put a Buy rating on the shares, along with a $126 price target that implies a one-year upside potential of 46%. (To watch Gabriele’s track record, click here) FIS has picked up 20 recent analyst reviews, and their overall breakdown of 10 Buys, 9 Holds, and 1 Sell gives the stock a Moderate Buy consensus rating. The stock is selling for $86.08 and its $98.80 average price target suggests that it will gain 15% in the coming year. (See FIS stock forecast) Fiserv, Inc. (FI) The second stock we’ll look at here is Fiserv, which has been in the fintech business since 1984, and has built itself up into a $126 billion giant of the industry. The company uses digital tech to move money and information, the key assets of the financial industry. Fiserv is committed to bringing both excellence and innovation to the fintech sector, and has made its service applicable to every aspect of the finance world, at any scale imaginable: banks and credit unions, large enterprises and financial institutions, software providers, small businesses and individual customers. The company’s services are available to customers online, or via a smartphone app. In terms of actual services, Fiserv offers solutions for account processing and digital banking, as well as networking and card issuer processing. The company can handle a variety of e-commerce tasks, including payments, merchant acquisition, and customer and merchant account management. Fiserv saw more than $19 billion in revenues last year, and its stock is a component of the S&P 500. That last point is important, as FI shares have outperformed their parent index by a wide margin recently. The stock is up more than 67% this year; as noted above, the S&P 500 has gained ~25% during the same time. In the third quarter of this year, its last reported, Fiserv had an adjusted revenue total of $4.88 billion, flat year-over-year and just missing the forecast by $30 million. The bottom-line figure, presented as a non-GAAP EPS of $2.30, was 4 cents better than had been anticipated. Along with these results, the company reported a 23% increase in free cash flow during the first nine months of 2024, to a total of $3.34 billion. Fiserv also raised its outlook for 2024 revenue growth to the range of 16% to 17%. Checking in again with Compass Point’s Gabriele, we see that the analyst is impressed with Fiserv’s continued growth and solid business model. He says, “FI is a steady compounding business with a trusted management team. FI has a strong mix of recurring SaaS revenue in their financial solutions segment (49% of total revenue) and cyclical upside in their merchant segment (51% of total revenue) with overall recurring revenue at ~85%. We believe this mix of business provides a unique balance to generate LT double-digit EPS growth with rising return on invested capital (ROIC). We believe FI can produce accelerating EPS growth in both 2025 and 2026 to ~19%.” These comments are presented along with a Buy rating on the stock – and the analyst’s price target, now set at $278, implies an upside of 25.5% in the year to come. There are 24 recent reviews on record for FI shares, and these include 19 Buys to 5 Holds for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The stock’s rapid gains this year have pushed the share price almost to the $221.89 average target price. It will be interesting to see whether analysts update their targets or downgrade their ratings shortly.  (See FISV stock forecast) To find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks’ Best Stocks to Buy, a tool that unites all of TipRanks’ equity insights.

On Monday, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services posted final payment determinations for its 2025 Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule. Included was a final decision related to CMS pricing for Exact Sciences Corp’s (NASDAQ:EXAS) Cologuard Plus, a second-generation test that received FDA approval in October. William Blair writes that the determinations effectively raise reimbursement by 16% versus the current Medicare rate for the first-generation Cologuard test (to $592 for Cologuard Plus from $509 for Cologuard). Also Read: Colorectal Cancer Diagnostic Focused Exact Sciences Stock Plunges On Weak Annual Guidance, Analyst Sees Compelling Long-Term Entry Point The determination reverses the September preliminary decision but aligns with a proposal made during the public comment period. The analyst writes that reimbursement for Cologuard Plus will now be calculated based on two components: three times the fee for methylation analysis of Septin-9 ($192 x 3) and the fee for a FIT test ($15.92). This pricing adjustment is expected to take effect for Medicare volumes when the test officially launches in late first quarter or early second quarter of 2025. Medicare fee-for-service volumes should reflect the new pricing immediately upon launch, with Medicare Advantage following soon after. The company is also likely to renegotiate commercial contracts for higher pricing, which may gradually roll out over the coming quarters and years. William Blair reiterates the Outperform rating on the stock. The analyst highlights that the update is a positive outcome for the company, as it simplifies the process of implementing a price increase compared to the more complex advanced diagnostic laboratory test (ADLT) pathway. From a financial perspective, this decision is expected to support a moderate pricing boost starting in 2025. Based on William Blair’s estimates, this could add at least 300 basis points to Cologuard's growth rate next year, which is projected to be around 15% overall. Exact Sciences said it will present 10 abstracts demonstrating the breadth of its Precision Oncology portfolio at the 2024 annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium scheduled next month.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medicare-premiums-rise-for-2025-nicking-retirees-social-security-checks-110009345.html,"Sun, Nov 24, 2024, 5:43 AM","Seniors awaiting an increase in their Social Security checks next year may be upset to discover that a chunk of that extra money is already spoken for. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) announced that 2025 monthly Part B premiums will climb to $185, an increase of $10.30 from $174.70 in 2024. And the annual Part B deductible, which most people must pay before their Medicare coverage begins, will rise by $17, or 7%, to $257 from $240. That news follows the Social Security Administration’s announcement of a 2.5% cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) for 2025, which will add about $50 to the average monthly benefit of roughly $1,900, according to the SSA. Ideally, that bump in benefits would provide some breathing room to the more than 72 million retired senior citizens and disabled workers who have grappled with higher prices in recent years. Next year, maybe not. “This marks the second year in a row where the Part B premium has risen by nearly 6%,” Mark Miller, a retirement expert and author of ""Retirement Reboot,"" told Yahoo Finance. “The high dollar amount of the increase will squeeze the Social Security COLA for seniors,” he said. “The squeeze will be most painful for people with lower benefit amounts.” For example, Miller said, someone with a $1,200 monthly benefit will see their COLA reduced to 1.6% once the Medicare increases are factored in. But for someone with a high benefit of $3,500, their COLA still increases by 2.2 percent. In addition, the Medicare Part A deductible that beneficiaries pay if admitted to the hospital will be $1,676 in 2025, an increase of $44 from $1,632 in 2024. Coinsurance amounts for hospital and skilled nursing care will also rise by 2.7 percent. Not everyone will feel the pinch. Under Social Security “hold harmless” rules, a person’s Part B premium increase cannot be larger than their COLA. People receiving less than about $415 in monthly Social Security benefits will not be charged the full Part B premium increase, per Phil Moeller, a Medicare and Social Security expert author of the book, “Get What’s Yours for Medicare.” In general, people who receive Social Security benefits are notified by mail in early December about their new benefit amount. Most beneficiaries can also view their COLA notice online through their personal Social Security account at ssa.gov/myaccount/. Read more: How to find out your 2025 Social Security COLA increase Since 2007, a beneficiary’s Part B monthly premium is based on his or her income. About 8% of Medicare users earn too much to qualify for the standard Part B and Part D premiums and must pay the surcharges, known as Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amounts (IRMAA). Details can be found on the CMS fact sheet. This year, Medicare beneficiaries with income over $106,000 (for single tax filers), $212,000 for joint filers and $106,000 (for married people that file separately) will pay the surcharge. For these beneficiaries, total monthly Part B premiums will range from $259 to $628.90. Your eligibility is determined by the Social Security Administration. The surcharge is calculated on a sliding scale with five income brackets topping out at $500,000 and $750,000 for individual and joint filing, respectively. These figures change annually with inflation. Calculations have a two-year lag time. Whether you pay a surcharge in 2025 depends on the income shown on your 2023 tax returns. “Unfortunately, it’s easy to trigger IRMAA when you first retire due to the two-year look back feature,” Miller said. “It’s also easy to encounter the surcharges if you’re enrolled in Medicare but still working full time. It’s a feature of Medicare that really angers retirees — and with good reason. You’re paying more for health insurance but not receiving anything additional in return.” Have a question about retirement? Personal finances? Anything career-related? Click here to drop Kerry Hannon a note. If you haven’t reviewed your Medicare coverage for next year, maybe the urgency of a deadline will help. There is still time to shop around to save on your Medicare coverage. Open enrollment for 2025 is underway, ending on Dec. 7. If you're eligible for Medicare, you can compare 2025 coverage options among Original Medicare, Medicare Advantage, and Part D prescription drug plans. Medicare’s online searchable Plan Finder on the Medicare.gov site allows you to review plan options. If you have a limited income, you might be eligible for Medicare’s Extra Help, which covers Part D premiums and deductibles and caps drug costs. Free one-on-one counseling is available through state Health Insurance Assistance Programs (SHIP). “It’s particularly important to review your plan this year,” Juliette Cubanski, deputy director of the program on Medicare policy at KFF, previously told Yahoo Finance. “We’re seeing some changes not just in terms of premiums, but in terms of cost-sharing, deductibles, and aspects of coverage that could affect both what people pay, but also their ability to access the medications that they need,” she said.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/will-musk-do-for-america-what-he-did-for-twitter-heres-what-the-numbers-say-110037470.html,"Sat, Nov 23, 2024, 4:35 AM","Elon Musk, the richest person in the US, is being treated by lots of people — including President-elect Donald Trump — as a cost-cutting genius. That’s why Trump has put Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy in charge of coming up with plans to drastically slash federal government expenditures. But when you look at what’s happened to the value of X, the platform formerly known as Twitter, since Musk bought control of it two years ago and fired 80% of its employees, you see that his cost-cutting crusade has turned into a financial fiasco for him and his 19 coinvestors. It’s important to understand what Musk has wrought at X because he will be trying to do to America what he did to Twitter. And the massive mess that Musk has created at X hasn’t gotten anything like the attention it deserves. Here's a reminder. According to the most recent available numbers, which we’ll get to in a bit, Musk and his co-investors have lost more than $25 billion on their Twitter takeover. That’s right. More than $25,000,000,000. How can I know that when X is a private company that doesn’t release financial results? It’s because Musk’s coinvestors include the Fidelity group of mutual funds. Fidelity, you see, is required to value its funds' holdings in X at their market value rather than at their cost because investors buy and sell mutual fund shares based on the shares’ net asset value. According to Fidelity's financial filings, its funds' stake in X has fallen almost 80% in value since the Musk takeover. For example, Fidelity’s Contrafund (FCNTX) valued its stake at $53,469,000 when Twitter morphed into X in October of 2022 but valued that stake at only $11,383,550 as of Sept. 30, the most recent available number. That’s a 78.7% drop. Buying Twitter was a $46.5 billion deal: $44 billion went to shareholders and about $2.5 billion went to expenses. Musk and his coinvestors put about $33 billion into the takeover, with X borrowing the remaining $13.5 billion. Apply a 78.7% drop to that $33 billion investment, and you see that Musk and his coinvestors are down about $26 billion. Of this, about $20.4 billion is Musk’s portion of the loss, and the other $5.6 billion is the coinvestors’ loss. Obviously, I can’t prove that Musk eviscerating 80% of Twitter’s workforce is responsible for the almost 80% loss that Musk et al. have suffered. No one can. But the evisceration of the workforce and the subsequent evisceration of X’s value certainly raises the question of whether Musk can be trusted to cut federal spending to the bone without inflicting massive damage on tens of millions of people. We’re all entitled to answer that question in our own way. But even though Musk is arguably the most successful investor of our time, to me the Twitter/X numbers are telling us that the answer to this question is “no.” (Disclosure: I have bought one share of Musk’s Tesla (TSLA) and one share of Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) to give me guaranteed access to the companies’ shareholder documents.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-isnt-frothy-even-with-this-rally--the-kimchi-premium-helps-explain-why-110059272.html,"Sat, Nov 23, 2024, 3:00 AM","This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings One of the hardest jobs in the business is price targets. As we enter the 2025 outlook season, that becomes exceedingly clear as strategists lay out their cases based on underlying economic growth metrics, corporate projections, probabilities, and experience. But what if you had almost none of those data points? That’s what the crypto analysts have to do. Without having fundamentals and executive management team outlooks to look at, you’re not left with much more than sentiment — and the challenge to get creative in measuring it. As our Chart of the Week shows, bitcoin has surged ever higher since the election as demand has risen. It's been surfing as high as the $99,000 mark as it nears six digits for the first time, thanks to the promise of an executive branch filled with crypto allies — if not believers — who will unlock the next wave of demand. “Anecdotally, we are seeing renewed interest in crypto from casual observers,” Sean Farrell, Fundstrat’s head of digital asset strategy, wrote in a note to clients this week, noting that “friends and family” are back to asking about crypto. Once again, we’re at the point in the cycle where the bitcoin conversation is spilling over from more niche financial media to pretty much everybody. And just like the spikes of 2017 and 2021, it's just in time to be a key topic around the Thanksgiving table. Comparisons that invoke the big question, of course, about whether this is the latest top. But according to Farrell, “looking beyond social cues to more quantifiable market indicators, the current landscape does not exhibit the frothiness of the March rally or the late 2021 cyclical peak.” One such “quantifiable” market indicator of sentiment and froth is the difference in price between bitcoin in South Korea and bitcoin on, say, Coinbase — the other component of our Chart of the Week. The crypto industry calls this the “Kimchi Premium” or the “Korea Premium Index,” and it stems from the country’s idiosyncratic capital control laws that prevent arbitrage. If you buy in South Korea, you have to sell it there. (This phenomenon helped inspire Sam Bankman-Fried’s arbitrage play.) “When speculative fervor commences, we end up seeing a premium on the price of BTC on Korean exchanges relative to other crypto exchanges,” Farrell wrote. “Currently, the premium is around 0%, signaling a lack of overexuberance among Korean traders.” Usually, he added, the premium surges past 10% if the market is peaking. This illustrates how complicated reading sentiment and demand actually is. Despite record highs, questions from family and friends, a rise in “buy bitcoin” queries on Google, and Coinbase’s high position in the app store, this premium — as well as various other creative sentiment tools Fundstrat and others use to measure — are far from flashing warning signs. In fact, Farrell says that with the political tailwinds, there’s room to run. “The past week’s rally should not be dismissed as mere speculative exuberance,” he wrote.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-stock-sees-biggest-weekly-gain-since-january--and-analysts-say-theres-more-room-to-run-210910624.html,"Fri, Nov 22, 2024, 1:16 PM","Netflix stock (NFLX) closed at a fresh record every day this past week, with shares securing their biggest weekly gain since January — and they could keep soaring. A growing number of analysts are calling for the streaming giant's shares to soon trade in the quadruple digits. On Wednesday, Pivotal Research analyst Jeff Wlodarczak raised his price target on Netflix to a Street high of $1,100 a share, implying over 20% upside based on current trading levels of around $900. Bank of America's Jessica Reif Ehrlich followed one day later, boosting her target to $1,000 from $800. Jefferies analyst James Heaney also raised his target to $1,000 earlier this week. The price target increases come despite some concerns over slowing growth for the streaming giant. Wall Street analysts who cover Netflix have a median price target of just around $800 a share, according to the latest Bloomberg consensus estimates. One of the main catalysts for the recent price target boosts is the company's continued foray into live events, with the most recent boxing match between Jake Paul and Mike Tyson attracting over 108 million global viewers last weekend to become the most-streamed sporting event of all time. For context, the 2024 Super Bowl, which was the most-watched American TV broadcast ever, pulled in 124 million US viewers. The Netflix event's impressive numbers came despite the streamer experiencing several technical glitches throughout the broadcast, which analysts (and investors) mostly shrugged off. ""We view the event as a (very) successful learning experience for NFLX and expect these technical issues will not happen again with future live events,"" Pivotal Research's Wlodarczak wrote on Wednesday. The analyst said the event's success likely means Netflix will ""accelerate its offerings of 'eventized' live programming,"" which will help lower subscriber churn and increase the streamer's ability to raise prices. ""The NFLX service remains a highly compelling, frankly relatively inexpensive, entertainment alternative for consumers, which bodes well for future subscriber/average revenue per user growth,"" he said. Since the start of the year, Netflix shares have surged roughly 85%, far outpacing the broader markets and streaming rivals, including Disney (DIS) and Comcast (CMCSA). Over the 5-day period ending on Friday, the stock climbed about 9%. Much of the uptick has been driven by the company's push into live content and the positive impact that could have on its ad-supported offering. Last week, Netflix said its ad tier, now two years old, has reached 70 million global monthly active users, a significant jump from the 40 million users the company revealed at its second Upfront presentation in May. Netflix's next big live event will be its NFL Christmas Day doubleheader, with the Kansas City Chiefs vs. Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens vs. Houston Texans. Beyoncé will serve as the headline performer during the Ravens vs. Texans halftime show, which analysts said should help attract viewers outside of the US. The company inked a three-season deal with the NFL earlier this year to air the Christmas Day games, which will be produced by CBS Sports (PARA). The streamer reportedly coughed up about $75 million per game, according to the Wall Street Journal. Jefferies' Heaney, who described the success of the Paul-Tyson match as a ""breakthrough"" moment for Netflix's live events strategy, said he's increasingly confident the NFL Christmas Day games will outperform linear viewership and serve as a catalyst to ad growth. BofA's Reif Ehrlich agreed, adding, ""Live and advertising are complementary growth drivers, as more live programming drives additional high value, premium ad inventory. Netflix's ability to monetize this premium live inventory will be key to making advertising a multiyear growth driver."" Netflix recently beat Wall Street expectations across every major financial metric in its third quarter results on Oct. 17, with shares surging to all-time highs as many analysts call Netflix the winner of the hard-fought streaming wars. Still, the company recently revealed that year-over-year engagement levels came in roughly flat — a potential headwind when it comes to its ability to raise prices and boost growth. ""With much of the subscriber growth seemingly representing improved monetization of an existing (and not growing) user base, we question whether the momentum can continue into next year,"" MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote in a recent note to clients. Valuation has also been a concern, with Fishman adding that Netflix's stock ""is massively expensive for a company whose own guidance implies a revenue deceleration into 2025."" Last month, Netflix said its revenue growth is expected to slow from an expected 15% this year to between 11% and 13% in 2025. Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-begins-rolling-out-recall-feature-to-developers-as-ai-pc-push-continues-180029894.html,"Fri, Nov 22, 2024, 10:00 AM","Microsoft (MSFT) is preparing to roll out its long-delayed artificial intelligence-powered Recall feature for Windows 11 PCs to developers as part of its Windows Insider program. The company initially announced Recall back in May when it debuted its Copilot+ PCs, AI PCs that have a specific set of features for running native AI applications. Recall is designed to capture screenshots of the various tasks you perform while using your computer, whether that’s browsing the web or working on a document. The idea is for you to be able to search through Recall’s screenshots and then be able to take action on them. Say you were searching for flights and hotels for an upcoming trip or doing research for a work project but closed out your browser. You’d be able to search Recall for information related to those topics and pull up the appropriate screenshots. With Microsoft’s Click to Do feature, which is also in preview, you’d then be able to take action on those screenshots. For instance, you’d be able to copy text, navigate back to the website Recall captured, or edit images. It sounds very convenient for keeping track of your activity and going back to tasks you need to finish, but Recall immediately set off alarm bells among security researchers and privacy experts. The fear is that hackers or other cyber criminals could gain access to Recall’s screenshots and get their hands on sensitive user data. Microsoft subsequently made a series of changes to Recall including making it an opt-in feature, rather than an opt-out feature, meaning users have to choose to use it instead of it automatically being available. The company also said Recall screenshots, or Snapshots as Microsoft calls them, are encrypted and can only be accessed using the company’s Windows Hello authentication feature. You can also choose whether or not Recall saves information from specific websites. The app will also recognize when you’re entering sensitive information like credit card numbers, passwords, and other personal identification numbers and temporarily stop saving screenshots. Microsoft also says you’ll be able to disable Recall through the Windows settings menu and that the feature is automatically removed from PCs that are managed by administrators for work and school. The Recall preview will initially only be available for Windows 11 laptops running Qualcomm’s (QCOM) Snapdragon processors. Intel (INTC) and AMD (AMD) laptops will have to wait. All of this is part of Microsoft’s effort to get users to buy into its Copilot+ PC effort. The general idea for the platform is to bring generative AI capabilities to Windows PCs through both on-device and cloud-based AI services. Microsoft already offers its marquee AI feature, Copilot, to users, but is continuing to expand on the software to give users more reasons to upgrade to AI PCs. Microsoft isn’t the only company using AI as a major selling point. Apple has already rolled out its first set of Apple Intelligence features for its iPhone, iPad, and Mac line of products, and Google is outfitting its software and Pixel line of phones with its own AI. It’s difficult to tell if consumers are truly interested in AI just yet, though. If you want Microsoft’s latest Surface laptop outfitted with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chip—an excellent device—you’re buying an AI PC, even if that wasn’t your intention. Ditto if you buy a new iPhone. Even if you’re not interested in the AI features, you’re still buying an AI smartphone. We’ll have to wait and see just how many users end up taking advantage of AI PC and AI smartphone software and how often they use it to get a better sense of whether the categories are successes in and of themselves.

The most-held cryptocurrency has been surging since the US presidential election as the crypto community expects a more friendly regulatory regime with President-Elect Trump as ""HODLer-in-chief."" That added to an already torrid rally this year, prompted by the introduction of spot bitcoin ETFs. On the policy front, encouraging signs have been mounting: Coinbase (COIN) CEO Brian Armstrong reportedly met with Trump to discuss his picks for head of the Securities and Exchange Commission. And SEC boss Gary Gensler and FDIC Chair Martin Gruenberg, seen as crypto foes by the industry, are stepping down around Inauguration Day. What crypto insiders and lobbyists say they want are “clear rules” around crypto. That seems to boil down to regulators making buying bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies easier. From the price action, it’s hard to see where anyone’s having trouble buying bitcoin. Its price has more than doubled this year, with a nearly 30% leap since the day after the election. But investors point to rules that required firms that held crypto on their balance sheets on behalf of clients to record those custody holdings as liabilities, among other issues. Mike Novogratz, CEO of Galaxy Digital, bemoaned the regulatory frictions in an interview with Yahoo Finance: “Fear of litigation. You couldn't get banked. You know, our audit at Galaxy cost three times what it would if we were a non-crypto company.” He expects all that to change, with policy from the top down allowing it to be easier to invest in crypto. From Trump to Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick, “All the guys around the table like our space. They believe in the digital asset world. They believe in blockchains and bitcoin and so the whole energy of this administration is going to be so different than the Elizabeth Warren, Gary Gensler era,” Novogratz said. And for prospective investors, bulls, and even governmental benefactors, it's much easier to sell (and buy) the bitcoin story and get people onboard when the price is going up. As bitcoin's history has shown, the best defense against complicated philosophical questions about what's behind it — no promises, goods, or ownership as cash, gold, and stock provide — is a growing price. With markets serving as a natural discounting mechanism, bitcoin and other crypto prices have already risen in anticipation of that D.C. energy shift, whether or not it will actually unlock further demand. What’s clear is that the biggest bitcoin catalyst continues to be momentum. Price gains beget price gains, perhaps more so than with any other asset. And the number keeps going up. Until it doesn’t. “At one point, there will be a washout,” Novogratz said. “I don't see it. It maybe doesn't happen until next year, but by definition, when there is tremendous one-way direction, something happens and everyone runs the other direction. And, you know, that's the nature of the beast in crypto at this point.” Julie Hyman is the co-host of Market Domination on Yahoo Finance. You can find her on social media @juleshyman.

The S&P 500 (^GSPC) advanced 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained over 400 points, or almost 1%, to close at a record. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.2%. The major gauges closed out the week with wins of over 1%, despite getting off to a lackluster start as the post-election rally stalled. Markets regrouped after Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings fell short of definitively settling the question of whether AI would keep boosting stocks. Some of the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech megacap stocks closed lower on Friday, including Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), dogged by the potential forced sale of Google Chrome. Consumer Discretionary (XLY), Industrials (XLI), and Financials (XLF) led the sector gains this week, with XLF closing at an all-time high. Wall Street is still waiting to learn whom Trump will tap for his Treasury secretary — an announcement that could sway markets, given its importance to the economy. The president-elect tapped former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi to be the US attorney general after his prior pick, Matt Gaetz, withdrew his name from consideration on Thursday. Meanwhile, surging bitcoin continued to move near the landmark $100,000 level, buoyed by growing confidence that the Trump administration will support pro-crypto policies. The leading token broke above $99,500 early on Friday before retreating amid hopes for looser regulatory oversight after SEC Chair Gary Gensler said he will step down soon. Smaller cryptocurrencies also got a boost. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Stocks rose on Friday with the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closing at a record high. The blue-chip index added more than 400 points, or about 1%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained almost 0.4%. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose slightly. All three major averages rose more than 1% for the week. The 'Magnificent Seven' stocks were mixed on Friday, with Nvidia (NVDA) shares dipping more than 3% while Tesla (TSLA) shares popped almost 4% on Friday, helping lift the Consumer Discretionary (XLY) sector. Investors also gravitated towards Industrials (XLI) and Financials (XLF), which also led the weekly sector gains. Oil moved higher for the week as traders priced the threat of a supply disruption amid an escalating Russia-Ukraine war. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) hovered around $99,200 as of 4 p.m. ET as investors watched the cryptocurrency climb toward the $100,000 milestone. Next Thursday, the stock market will be closed due to the Thanksgiving holiday. The biggest winning sectors this week were the ones leading Friday's gains — Consumer Discretionary (XLY), Industrials (XLI), and Financials (XLF). Here's a five-day chart of the sector action. Consumer Discretionary includes EV giant (TSLA), which is up for the week. Investors have also been rotating into Industrial stocks and bank stocks since Donald Trump's presidential win earlier this month. Oil moved up more than 1.5% on Friday as the Russia-Ukraine war escalated. West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) futures climbed to settle at $71.24 per barrel, while Brent (BZ=F), the international benchmark, rose above above $75. Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Friday he will continue testing a new missile after a recent strike against Ukraine in response to Kyiv’s use of US- and British-made weaponry this week. Crude prices were on pace for a weekly gain amid concerns that an escalated war could lead to the interruption of Russian supply. Nvidia (NVDA) shares dipped more than 3% to hit session lows on Friday afternoon despite quarterly results earlier this week that beat analyst expectations. Enthusiasm over how much higher shares of the chip giant can run seems to have stalled as investors have rotated out of the AI darling and into Consumer Discretionary (XLY), Industrials (XLI), and Financials (XLF). Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reports: Microsoft (MSFT) is preparing to roll out its long-delayed artificial intelligence-powered Recall feature for Windows 11 PCs to developers as part of its Windows Insider program. The company initially announced Recall back in May when it debuted its Copilot+ PCs, AI PCs that have a specific set of features for running native AI applications. Recall is designed to capture screenshots of the various tasks you perform while using your computer, whether that’s browsing the web or working on a document. Read more here. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) rose back above $99,000 as investors watched the cryptocurrency climb toward the $100,000 milestone. The token has been at the center of the Trump trade over optimism that the incoming administration will implement pro-crypto policies. Year to date, bitcoin is up more than 120%. Tesla (TSLA) shares popped 4% on Friday, helping lift the Consumer Discretionary (XLY) sector. Shares of the EV giant are on track for a weekly win. The stock is up roughly 40% since the presidential elections earlier this month over optimism that CEO Elon Musk's support for President-elect Donald Trump will result in looser regulations around autonomous driving. Satellite TV provider DirecTV (T, TPG) will no longer merge with rival Dish Network (SATS) after bondholders rejected the offer. The deal, which was contingent on a key debt exchange, would have created one of the nation's largest pay-TV providers. Both companies had discussed a possible combination more than two decades ago. “While we believed a combination of DirecTV and Dish would have benefited all stakeholders, we have terminated the transaction because the proposed exchange terms were necessary to protect DirecTV’s balance sheet and our operational flexibility,” DirecTV CEO Bill Morrow said in a statement. Shares in EchoStar, which owns Dish Network, fell by more than 4% on Friday following the news. The deal would have helped aid EchoStar's heavy debt load while also helping cut costs for the owners of DirecTV. AT&T spun off DirecTV in 2021, moving it into a joint venture with private equity investor TPG. At the time, it was valued at about $16 billion with the telecom giant taking a $15.5 billion impairment charge in 2020 to account for subscriber losses. DirecTV was dealt yet another blow after it lost its coveted Sunday Ticket package to Alphabet's YouTube TV (GOOGL, GOOG) in late 2022. Amid those struggles, AT&T recently revealed it would sell its entire 70% stake to TPG for $7.6 billion in a move that allows the telecom operator to fully exit the TV business. That deal is still on. AT&T previously had agreed to hold on to its stake in DirecTV for a three-year period, which expired on July 31. Nvidia (NVDA) shares dropped more than 2% on Friday, dragging on the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC). Shares of the AI chip heavyweight opened in the red after wavering between positive and negative territory on Thursday in reaction to the company's latest quarterly results. Other 'Magnificent Seven' stocks were also under pressure, with Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) down more than 1% after losing more than 4% in the prior session. E-commerce giant (AMZN) was also down less than 1%. Meanwhile, Tesla (TSLA) stock rose more than 1%. The Nasdaq was struggling to stay in green territory, down roughly 0.3% by 10:30 a.m. ET. US economic output is roaring as businesses prepare for lower interest rates and a new administration in Washington. S&P Global's flash US composite PMI, which captures activity in both the services and manufacturing sectors, came in at 55.3 in November, up from 54.1 in October. Economists had expected the index to tick up to 54.1. The composite PMI reading for November also signaled the fastest expansion of business activity since April 2022. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said the data shows business ramping up activity amid a changing operating environment, headed into 2025. “The business mood has brightened in November, with confidence about the year ahead hitting a two-and-a-half year high,"" Williamson said. ""The prospect of lower interest rates and a more pro-business approach from the incoming administration has fueled greater optimism, in turn helping drive output and order book inflows higher in November."" Super Micro Computer (SMCI) — an AI server maker that uses Nvidia's chips and has a major deal with Elon Musk's xAI — continued a sharp ascent Friday. Shares rose over 9% in early trading, putting the stock on track to record a weekly gain of over 65%. The stock's rally this week has been driven by the company's announcement that it's hired a new auditor and submitted a compliance plan to avoid delisting by the Nasdaq. Super Micro's prior accountant, Ernst & Young, resigned in late October, saying it was ""unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by management,"" and the server maker has been at risk of delisting. Super Micro is reportedly being investigated by the Department of Justice over allegations of accounting violations and other questionable business dealings outlined in a scathing report by short seller firm Hindenburg Research in late August. Reddit (RDDT) stock fell over 8% in early trading on Friday as investors reacted to a Bloomberg report that a company shareholder — Conde Nast parent Advance Magazine Publishers Inc. — is looking to establish a credit facility using its stake in the social media platform. Citing people familiar with the matter, Bloomberg reported that Advance Magazine Publishers Inc. is offering 7.8 million shares for $145.38 to $148.54 each, which would be valued at as much as $1.2 billion. That price range represented as much as an 8% discount on Reddit's closing price Thursday of $158. Reddit stock has been on a massive rally over the past month, surging more than 90% since its earnings beat in late October. The social media company went public in March in one of 2024's few hot IPOs, surging nearly 50% after its debut. Shares rose 16% on Thursday alone. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) added 250 points, or 0.6%, shortly after the market open as shares of Home Depot (HD), Honeywell (HON), and Nike (NKE) rose. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) gained 0.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) stepped above the flat line. Stocks wavered at the open on Friday, but the major averages were still on track to end the week with wins. Meanwhile, investors watched the price of bitcoin (BTC-USD), with the leading token trading a stone's throw away from $100,000. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose slightly, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was little changed. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) fell slightly. Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) shares extended losses after dropping more than 4% on Thursday amid the threat of a forced sale of Google's Chrome browser. Bitcoin climbed above $99,400 early on Friday before retreating. The cryptocurrency has been on fire since Donald Trump's presidential victory earlier this month, amid optimism that his incoming administration will implement crypto-friendly policies. By 9:30 a.m. ET, bitcoin was trading at just under $98,000. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) neared the $100,000 level Friday in its latest flirtation with the milestone.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/your-credit-report-is-missing-key-data-that-lenders-are-refusing-to-report-140042485.html,"Sat, Nov 23, 2024, 6:00 AM","I pay my credit card balance in full each month, but you'd never know it by looking at my credit report. In fact, I wouldn't look that much different from someone who pays only the minimum payment, which is considered riskier behavior by lenders. The weird thing: That information used to be in my credit report up until 10 years ago, when the biggest credit card companies stopped reporting that payment data because it created too much competition among lenders. As a result, people like me who pay off those balances are missing out on a better credit score and all the perks that come along with that, according to a recent study. ""It's harming anyone who's repaying their credit card in full. They're not being rewarded for that behavior through a high credit score,"" Benedict Guttman-Kenney, co-author of the study, told Yahoo Finance. ""It's also not incentivizing people to repay their credit card debt."" The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the government watchdog over financial services, has the power to force lenders to report this critical data, but it's unlikely the agency will have enough teeth to do so under the next administration. ""I think the CFPB is going to shift a lot in how things are administered,"" Brian Riley, director of credit advisory services at Javelin Strategy & Research, told Yahoo Finance. Read more: How to check your credit score From 2009 to 2013, most credit card issuers shared with the credit bureaus what people were scheduled to pay each month and how much they actually paid, even though they were not required to under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. The share of accounts on credit reports showing that information was 89% in 2013, Guttman-Kenney's study found. A year later, that percentage dropped to 55%, and by 2022 only 36% of credit card accounts included that data in a person's credit report. What happened after 2013 that prompted such a decline? That year, TransUnion — one of the three mega credit bureaus — launched a trended data product, which showed whether a potential borrower was getting riskier or less risky based on a historical view of their accounts. One of the pieces of information included in that product was the actual payment amounts on the borrower’s debts. TransUnion pitched its product this way: The data could help lenders ""identify specific credit trends and payment behaviors that allow them to make more precise lending decisions,” an executive said two years after the launch. “These added insights will help our clients confidently engage new credit-worthy and credit-seeking populations. The result: More consumers will gain access to credit."" And, of course, lenders would come away with more new customers. It was such a promising spiel that the two other bureaus, Experian and Equifax, quickly followed with trended data products of their own. Soon after, though, that payment information started disappearing from all our credit reports. A separate study conducted by the CFPB found almost the exact results. So, what on earth spooked the credit card issuers? It turns out that the trended data worked too well. It allowed lenders to target potential cardholders who would be very profitable — and who presumably were customers of other issuers. Lenders could home in on those who spend a lot and generate revenue from transaction fees. And they could zero in on cardholders who pay the minimum or just above and rack up a lot in interest charges. ""Any bureau in the country can take an order from a top issuer that says 'I want accounts that look like this, so I can solicit them,'"" Riley said. ""If that information is out there, it would be easier for competitors to find those customers they want to poach."" Trended data rankled the six largest credit card issuers the most. Together, American Express, Bank of America, Capital One, Citibank, Discover, and JPMorgan Chase have cornered two-thirds of the credit card market since the early 2000s, said Guttman-Kenney, who co-authored the study with Andres Shahidinejad, and those six suppressed the data the most. ""They're larger, so they have more to potentially lose,"" he said. That's why they quit reporting payment amounts to the credit bureaus: ""to preserve their status quo in the market."" The CEOs of the big six said as much themselves. In response to a CFPB request in 2022, one chief exec said the company found that “other major issuers were no longer providing this information"" and that left his company at a ""competitive disadvantage."" Read more: Does getting your credit card declined hurt your credit score? The ones at a real disadvantage, though, are consumers. By not reporting that payment data, borrowers who pay down their outstanding balances appear riskier than they otherwise are. Because of it, they may get worse terms when they take out credit, such as higher interest rates or smaller credit limits. Competition in the market is also generally good for consumers because it drives down prices, lowers interest rates, increases credit limits, and improves rewards. It also allows new lenders to compete for customers instead of a market where six issuers dominate. In fact, consumers whose lenders reported payment data were more likely to open new credit card accounts for up to two years after trended data was introduced, Guttman-Kenney's study found. ""What these lenders are doing [now] is they're preventing customers from getting better credit card offers from competitors,"" he said. Read more: 10 tips to improve your credit score The CFPB could mandate credit card issuers to report this data again. It has the rule-writing authority that it could choose to exercise. There's precedent, too. Before the formation of the CFPB in July 2010, the Federal Trade Commission had this authority and, in 2009, wrote rules that required lenders to report credit card limits to the credit bureaus. The circumstances looked similar. Lenders refused to share this information because adding a credit limit would make a person look less risky (and more attractive to competitors) by lowering their total utilization rate — the percentage of available credit they use. ""So lenders were strategically hiding the credit card limit as a way of preserving [their customer base],"" said Guttman-Kenney. That sounds familiar. Once credit limits were reported on credit reports, people's credit scores increased on average, and switching to new credit cards increased, Guttman-Kenney said. So far, the CFPB hasn't made any moves to address reporting payment amounts. However, a new personal financial data rights rule does require financial institutions, including credit card issuers, to transfer an individual’s personal financial data to another provider at the person's request for free. Theoretically, consumers could provide that payment data to a new credit card lender on their own. That is, of course, if the new rule isn't rolled back under a second Trump administration. In Donald Trump's first term, the then-acting director of the CFPB, Mick Mulvaney, pulled back hard on enforcement and regulatory actions that occurred under his predecessor, Riley said. A similar sentiment could be brewing following Trump's 2024 election and the GOP's control of Congress. Republicans have long loathed the CFPB.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mixing-it-up-porsche-unveils-a-new-gas-powered-911-carrera-t-and-electric-taycan-gts-160019197.html,"Sun, Nov 24, 2024, 7:31 AM","For Porsche (DRPRY), being flexible is sehr gutes Geschäft, or very good business. The German luxury and sports brand is known for the iconic 911 sports car, but of course in recent years sales successes like the Macan and Cayenne SUVs and the fully electric Taycan showed a different path was possible. In fact, a couple of years back, it decided that 80% of its cars would be EVs by the end of the decade — and ushered plans for new EVs like the Macan EV and replacements for the 718 Boxster and Cayman, which would also be EVs. How things change. The general EV market isn’t growing as much as experts thought, and many luxury brands like Mercedes and Audi have seen EV sales plummet. Porsche also backed away from its ambitious electrification plans. Porsche too saw Taycan EV sales slip in 2024, but the company attributed this drop to supply chain issues and customers waiting for the updated Taycan. Now the wait is over: The new Taycan is here. And so is the new 911 Carrera T, the stripped-down 911 — meaning it's more lightweight than the regular 911 and includes some of the more performance-oriented options only available on higher trim levels. For Porsche, debuting both cars at the same time makes sense. That's because it is what their drivers want: more gas-powered sports cars and performance-oriented EVs. There's a market for both. “When it comes to [a Porsche], it's meant to be a driver's car. It's meant to be engaging, it's meant to be practical … and there's no reason why an electric car can't do that,"" said Porsche North America’s product specialist Frank Wiesmann to Yahoo Finance when discussing the Taycan. By the same token, Weismann noted Porshe is ""still very passionate about very analog cars,” meaning the 911 with its manual transmission and a howling gas engine. After all these years, it doesn't get more analog than the 911. The new 911 Carrera T comes with lightweight glass and less sound-deadening material to give the car a more raw feel, but it now includes rear-wheel steering as a standard option, sits lower, and has better brakes, among other sporty options. But the biggest change may be that the Carrera T is manual transmission only. “The US is pretty much the biggest market for us when it comes to people that are looking for a transmission like that,” Wiesmann said. “So if you're really wanting to be one with the car, row your own gears and have that engaging element that many purist drivers still find very important. They want to shift themselves. That's just an additional layer of involvement with the car.” Indeed, Porsche said 70% of US buyers of the prior Carrera T selected it with the seven-speed manual. Now it comes in six-speed flavor, with a sportier short-throw shifter and new linkages, giving it a more direct, mechanical — or analog — feel. On the opposite spectrum is the Taycan. Porsche’s first all-electric vehicle impressed me with its ferocious horsepower, torque figures, and race-tuned chassis and suspension setup. The new GTS improves on those characteristics, with Porsche Active Ride suspension that irons out the bumps on the road, new aero and design bits, and nearly 100 more horsepower, now hitting 690 hp. Porsche hopes the new changes across the Taycan EV lineup will help boost sales. For a car that starts at $99,400, all the new updates will help in a highly competitive marketplace featuring competitors like the Tesla Model S and Lucid Air. Taycan isn't just competing against EVs but gas-powered cars and hybrids too. And that’s why Porsche went multi-energy, as some have called it, with hybrid Cayenne SUVs and Panamera sedans also in the product portfolio. And the 911 gets hybrid power too, in the new 911 Carrera GTS. “We always wanted to remain flexible with the powertrain strategy,” Weismann said. “Some people really want an EV environment at home, where they park the car, charge the car; the way they use it supports that. And other people do not, and they might be a little bit skeptical, and maybe a hybrid that offers some electrification but still retains the familiarity and security of a gas engine makes that entry a little easier.” Weismann and Porsche’s decision to switch it up and offer various powertrain options here isn't unique in the industry, but what is unique is that the sporty brand feels all options — even hybrids — have something to offer from an enthusiast perspective. “It really speaks to no matter what the powertrain is, it always should reflect the company's core values,” Wiesmann said. The 2025 911 Carrera T and Taycan GTS will arrive in dealerships next year, with the Carrera T starting at $135,995 and the Taycan GTS at $149,895. Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-worlds-biggest-business-leaders-talk-tariff-man-trump-133023414.html,"Sun, Nov 24, 2024, 6:08 AM","This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings We have entered phase two of the Trump tariff concerns among the upper echelon of power brokers at the world's biggest companies. I would loosely characterize phase one as a shell-shocked, bantering state that emerged in the seven days after this month's election. Leaders I talked to in the election's aftermath were still trying to process the outcome and what it meant in the near term to their workers and businesses. Not many were sure if Trump would make good on his litany of head-scratching promises — and if they did have a view, they had no intention of sharing it on the record with yours truly. As a reminder, Trump has floated 60% or higher tariffs on China and up to 20% on most goods out of other countries. Now, welcome to phase two, where leaders are beginning to speak publicly on the issue and work connections behind the scenes in an attempt to change the president-elect's mind on tariffs. ""I've also spent time with our team talking about, OK, when something is announced, we want to be doing pricing actions with our customers of some magnitude. And so we've actually started to have some of those conversations with our channel customers in the last week or two,"" Stanley Black & Decker (SWK) CEO Don Allan told me this week on Yahoo Finance (video above). ""We won't do anything until we see something that says, here's what the new world of tariffs is going to be."" Allan said he's been spending time with politicians and people close to the incoming Trump administration to help them understand the detrimental impact of potential tariffs. Explained Allan, ""When I look at our industry, if I took our Chinese operation that we have today that makes power tools and brought it over in the US, the cost to make that product would be about 60% to 70% higher. So it's substantial, which the consumer will not pay for. And so if we're going to reduce our China exposure, which we are, we'll be looking at other Southeast Asian countries like Vietnam or maybe Mexico, where we certainly have a significant operation already."" Allan's worries about tariffs are being echoed elsewhere. ""Look, if [tariffs do] happen, it would create macroeconomic implications, and it would likely be in the form of additional inflationary pressures on consumers. But it's also important to note we have increased flexibility to continue to evolve our supply chain, and we'll ensure we're in the strongest possible position as trends unfold,"" Gap (GAP) CEO Richard Dickson told me on the phone after another quarterly earnings beat. Fellow apparel CEO Dan Sheridan of Brooks Running told me on the Opening Bid podcast that tariffs would send sneaker prices much higher. ""An additional 20-25 [percent tariff] ... it's huge. The conversation is massive,"" he said. ""To absorb that as a business begins to take investment out of R&D ... We have to pass those on to the consumer and you can't pass a 25% lift in cost completely."" Speaking of macroeconomic implications, Goldman Sachs' chief Jan Hatzius sought to bring a dose of blunt reality to investors on the topic this week. ""Moving toward a broader trade war would reinforce US dollar upside but put pressure on global equities. Unusually high US equity valuations not only dampen long-term expected returns but also amplify the potential reaction to any economic weakness,"" Hatzius said in a new research note. Subscribe to Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast Hatzius said tariffs could ultimately tighten financial conditions in the near term and weigh on US economic growth. ""We want lower prices for our customers and members. We advocate for them ... for lower prices and value. And so we will do everything that we can to not raise prices. But right now, this is speculation. We don't know what categories of items could — or even what countries — tariffs could apply to. We are familiar with this. And if we look back historically when tariffs were enacted seven years ago, it did result in higher prices for customers,"" Walmart CFO John David Rainey said on Yahoo Finance's Morning Brief. The bottom line is that Corporate America is beginning to speak out against the self-imposed Tariff Man. Whether they can do it to his face if need be, who knows. But leaders have a point on tariffs, and their point may be proven out in the form of much higher prices for consumers and lower stock prices to boot.

S&P Global's flash US composite PMI, which captures activity in both the services and manufacturing sectors, came in at 55.3 in November, up from 54.1 in October. Economists had expected the index to tick up to 54.3. November's S&P composite PMI signaled the fastest expansion of business activity since April 2022. Chris Williamson, chief business economist at S&P Global Market Intelligence, said in a press release that the data shows businesses' ramping activity amid a changing operating environment headed into 2025. “The business mood has brightened in November, with confidence about the year ahead hitting a two-and-a-half year high,"" Williamson said. ""The prospect of lower interest rates and a more pro-business approach from the incoming administration has fueled greater optimism, in turn helping drive output and order book inflows higher in November."" The uptick in activity was largely driven by the services sector. The services component of S&P's report showed the index registered 57 this month, up from 55 in October and the highest level in 32 months. Meanwhile, the manufacturing sector remained in contraction with a reading of 48.8, up from 48.5, and the highest level in four months. Any reading above 50 for these indexes represents expansion in the sector; readings below 50 indicate contraction. Still, Williamson noted that the totality of the data points to another solid quarter of economic growth to end the year. ""The rise in the headline flash PMI indicates that economic growth is accelerating in the fourth quarter, while at the same time inflationary pressures are cooling,"" Williamson wrote. ""The survey's price gauge covering goods and services signaled only a marginal increase in prices in November, pointing to consumer inflation running well below the Fed's 2% target."" The upbeat projection on the US economy to end the year falls in line with current estimates for fourth quarter gross domestic product (GDP). The Atlanta Fed's GDPNow Tool model, which incorporates data from the current quarter to project GDP, estimates the US economy will have grown at an annualized rate of 2.6% in the fourth quarter. In an economic outlook note sent to clients on Thursday, Deutsche Bank chief US economist Matthew Luzzetti increased his projections for GDP in 2025 in part due to the incoming Trump administration. ""Stronger momentum heading into 2025 combined with modest tax cuts, a deregulation push, and more supportive financial conditions should produce faster growth next year, which we now see at 2.5% versus 2.2% previously,"" Luzzetti wrote.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/this-week-in-bidenomics-the-republican-economy-takes-off-190718096.html,"Fri, Nov 22, 2024, 11:07 AM","Republicans are suddenly warming to the US economy. Democrats have become gloomy. The economy itself hasn’t changed much in recent weeks, but something else has: There was a presidential election. Donald Trump’s narrow win in the 2024 presidential race highlights an oddity of modern economics: Confidence in the economy is partisan. Democrats and Republicans each feel better about the economy when their party is in control of the government and worse when the other party is running things. For some Americans, the actual state of the economy matters less than who’s in charge of it. This dichotomy shows up neatly in the latest University of Michigan consumer sentiment data. The sentiment index for Republicans jumped from 53.6 in October to 69.1 in November, putting it at the highest level since shortly after President Joe Biden took office in 2021. Among Democrats, sentiment dropped from 91.4 in October to 81.3 in November. That’s the lowest level for Democrats in 18 months. Democrats are still more optimistic than Republicans, but a large gap grew much narrower immediately after the election. The flip was even more stark when respondents gave their outlook for future economic conditions. The index for future expectation soared from 61.4 to 89.2 among Republicans, while it tumbled from 93.1 to 75.4 among Democrats. Republicans are now more optimistic about future conditions than Democrats for the first time since October of 2020. Independents are more sober-minded and stable. They’re less optimistic than partisans on either side on both current sentiment and the future outlook. Both readings fell slightly for Independents from October to November, which may better reflect what’s happening in the real economy, rather than the political one. Similar patterns held around the presidential elections in 2012, 2016, and 2020, with backers of the winning party suddenly becoming more optimistic and those affiliated with the losers more dreary. The Michigan pollsters used to ask about party affiliation only sporadically, but they made it a routine monthly question after the 2016 election. So how is the economy actually doing? Meh, according to most Americans. Accounting for all political persuasions, the Michigan index ticked upward in November, but it remains depressed, well below 2021 levels before a bout of inflation kicked in, and even further below pre-COVID levels of 2019. Inflation factors heavily into the Michigan methodology, and inflation still nettles Americans bearing the higher cost of rent and groceries. Drop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter. Other indicators are stronger. The Consumer Board Confidence Index is slightly more buoyant than the Michigan one. Job growth is strong, and GDP growth is decent. Inflation, which peaked at 9% in 2022, is getting back to normal. Goldman Sachs puts the odds of a recession during the next year at a meager 15% (and it’s the same for both Republicans and Democrats). But Trump himself is a wild card in the future outlook for the economy. His plans to slap new tariffs on imports and deport millions of migrants doing low-income work could nick economic growth and push inflation higher than it would otherwise be. Trump still hasn’t revealed how aggressively he’ll pursue either of those goals, but markets are bracing for a modest impact. Long-term interest rates have been rising, for example, in anticipation of higher inflation under Trump and tighter monetary policy to combat it. Democrats might feel sure that a Trump crash is coming. Republicans see smooth sailing ahead. Maybe you’re really as well off as you persuade yourself to be.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/feds-preferred-inflation-gauge-highlights-holiday-shortened-trading-week-what-to-know-this-week-122846140.html,"Mon, Nov 25, 2024, 4:01 AM","Stocks drifted higher leading into the shortened trading week, which includes the Thanksgiving holiday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained nearly 2% for the past week, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) added over 1.5%. This week, a fresh reading on the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, will highlight the economic calendar. Updates on third quarter economic growth and housing activity are also on the schedule. In corporate news, quarterly results from Zoom (ZM), Dell (DELL), Best Buy (BBY), CrowdStrike (CRWD), and Macy's (M) are likely to catch investor attention. Markets will be closed on Thursday for Thanksgiving, and Friday's trading session will end early at 1 p.m. ET. Recent sticky inflation readings have raised questions about whether the Fed will cut interest rates in December and how much the central bank will lower rates over the next year. Earlier this month, the ""core"" Consumer Price Index (CPI), which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, showed prices increased 3.3% in October for the third consecutive month. Meanwhile, the ""core"" Producer Price Index (PPI) revealed prices increased by 3.1% in October, up from 2.8% the month prior and above economist expectations for a 3% increase. On Wednesday, Federal Reserve governor Michelle Bowman expressed concern that the Fed’s progress toward 2% inflation has “stalled” and said the central bank should proceed ""cautiously"" when cutting interest rates. ""We have seen considerable progress in lowering inflation since early 2023, but progress seems to have stalled in recent months,"" Bowman said in a speech at the Forum Club of the Palm Beaches. Read more: Jobs, inflation, and the Fed: How they're all related Economists expect more signs of that stalling in the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) release due Wednesday. Economists expect annual ""core"" PCE — which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy — to have clocked in at 2.8% in October, up from the 2.7% seen in September. Over the prior month, economists project ""core"" PCE at 0.3%, unchanged from September. Bank of America Securities US economist Stephen Juneau wrote in a research note that a print in line with expectations will ""certainly lead Fed participants to reassess their inflation and policy outlook."" ""That said,"" he added, ""we still expect the Fed to cut rates by 25bp in December, but the risk appears to be tilting towards a shallower cutting cycle given resilient activity and stubborn inflation."" On Monday, markets were pricing in a 44% chance the Federal Reserve doesn't cut interest rates at its December meeting, up from a roughly 24% a month prior, per the CME FedWatch Tool. While a holiday-shortened trading week will limit stock action, one of Wall Street's hottest trades since election night is likely to keep surging. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has shot up nearly 50% since Donald Trump won the presidential election, as crypto enthusiasts have cheered a changed regulatory outlook. On Thursday, SEC Chair Gary Gensler announced he will be stepping down on Jan. 20, and bitcoin quickly rose to nearly $100,000 per coin for the first time ever. FedWatch Advisors chief investment officer Ben Emons told Yahoo Finance the rise of bitcoin is another sign of the risk-on mood in markets present since Trump won the election. ""We may not be so much in an environment like 2021 when it was frothy,"" Emons said. ""This is more about we're going to potentially really go into a different environment next year with the economy, with faster growth, and more liquidity. [So] then, yes, bitcoin should be trading at higher levels. So breaking $100,000 [per coin] is quite likely here."" Read more: Bitcoin clears another record: Is now the time to invest? Wall Street research firms are beginning to issue 2025 outlooks for the equity market. Largely, these reports have been bullish. Research teams tracked by Yahoo Finance have projected the benchmark index will finish as low as 6,400 next year or as high as 7,000. But, as DataTrek co-founder Nicholas Colas pointed out, many of the current targets fall in line with the traditional average annual return of the S&P 500 over the last century. And that roughly 11% annual return rarely ever comes over a one-year period. ""While the mean long-run return is a comforting anchor for expectations, much less discussed is that the range around that average is very wide,"" Colas wrote. He pointed out that the standard deviation from the 11.7% average annual return is 19.6 percentage points. That means any return from a 7.8% decline to a 31.2% increase could be considered ""entirely consistent with historical norms,"" he noted. This brings Colas to what he sees as the true takeaway from Wall Street's recent bullish calls — it's more about the direction of the market than the actual projection strategists slap on the S&P 500. And Colas largely agrees with the upside many have been pointing to for next year. ""The most important issue for anyone invested in the US equity market is the stability of the US economy in 2025,"" Colas wrote. He cited the US labor market's solid footing, lower interest rates, and an incoming administration that's expected to bring tax cuts and deregulation as reasons the economy will remain resilient in the coming year. ""We remain positive and believe the S&P 500 can rally more than its long-term average over the coming year,"" Colas wrote. ""The setup going into 2025 more closely resembles exceptionally strong years rather than weak ones. We therefore expect the S&P 500 to gain around 15 percent in 2025, ending the year at 6,840 based on [Thursday's] close.""

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/author-qa-the-7-year-old-making-your-money-decisions-170840901.html,"Sat, Nov 23, 2024, 9:08 AM","Untwisting your relationship with money can take years of therapy. For me, overhearing tense financial conversations between my mom and dad when I was a kid triggered me to throw up a wall when my husband would initiate money talks, or I simply avoided them. I’m a work in progress, but recognizing the source of my angst has made all the difference. Aja Evans, a board-certified therapist specializing in financial therapy, knows all about that dance. Her mission: to help people dig inward to understand the roots of how their finances spark their emotions, learn to change that behavior, and manage their money with poise and tenacity. In her new book, “Feel Good Finance: Untangle Your Relationship with Money for Better Mental, Emotional, and Financial Well-Being,” Evans deftly explores how our thoughts, feelings, and behaviors directly affect the way we manage our finances. Here's what Evans had to say about how recognizing the psychological power of money in our lives can set us up for financial success in a conversation with Yahoo Finance’s Kerry Hannon. Edited excerpts: Kerry Hannon: Who is this book for? Aja Evans: My target reader is women because a lot of times they’ve been socialized not to talk about money and grew up without the information. They’re living their lives and going to work every day and feeling weird about their money and not understanding why they don't know how to invest in the way they think that they should, or why it's hard sometimes to keep on top of their budget. Read more: How to budget: Your complete guide to budgeting for 2024 One nugget that came out early in the book is how we deal with money forms between the ages of 7 and 9. Can you elaborate? Research suggests that’s the age range when people are really forming their money beliefs. What you believe about money and how it makes you feel, you pick up from people around you as you grow up. It could be your parents, different family members, school friends. That's when you're starting to formulate the foundation of your money beliefs that then can potentially carry you through adulthood. You give an example of a woman who was a hoarder of her savings and fearful of even buying a car for herself. What was that all about? Her household growing up was unstable, and holding onto her money gave her security and made it difficult to spend the money when she really did need something. How did you help her recognize it and make changes? We worked on realizing that she can spend this money and still be stable. She didn’t have to blow her whole savings. Being able to afford to buy the car is about stability as well. It was shifting her perspective on what stability can look like. Yes, you have the money. You have enough money for your emergency fund, but you also have enough money to buy the car too. And that will also make sure that you're safe, that you're stable, that you can get to work. You pose reflection questions to help us explore our feelings about money. What are a few that you consider particularly important and why? One is what's your earliest money memory? These core memories that you hold can help you uncover how those impact you today. I ask: Are they hindering you in any way? Or do you feel like they are driving you forward? Are they still values that hold true, or are they some things that may be hindering you because you could do different things with your money, or grow your money in a different way, but it feels frightening? People get so worked up that they don't do it at all. They think: ‘I'm overwhelmed. I'm so anxious, I'm going to walk away. I'm not going to do it.’ I also ask: What do you need to feel more confident with your money? Is that a community to have more conversations about it? Is it feeling like you can trust people to have those conversations? Is it personal finance education to start feeling like you know what you’re talking about? For a lot of women, knowing what they're talking about is important to be comfortable taking on the risk of investing, or even making a budget. Read more: How to start investing: A step-by-step guide How can our emotions impact our spending? Many times people don't realize that they are trying to cope with how they feel about themselves, or wanting other people to see them in a certain way. I use the acronym HALT. Are you hungry, angry, lonely, or tired? That can allow you to see if you are trying to cope with something that you’re going through internally or emotionally by spending money. Are you buying things because you’re really angry at somebody, or because you're lonely right now and looking for that quick dopamine hit? You write about the mash-up of net worth and self-worth. Can you explain? This comes up so frequently with my clients — especially since my practice is based in New York City. It's a very competitive city and what ends up happening is people are seeking the external validation of their salaries and their titles that tell them that they’re valuable. I flip that and work with people to realize that you're valuable no matter what you're making. You're valuable no matter what your net worth is, and that you can have good self-esteem and be a worthy human no matter what your net worth is. I have an example in the book of a woman who was offered a job she really wanted to take, but it was a huge pay cut from her previous job. She wrestled with that, and we worked on the emotional and psychological aspects of her decision. She ultimately took the job, and she learned to shift her spending. She began finding value in herself when she wasn't hiding behind what she was able to buy. Have a question about retirement? Personal finances? Anything career-related? Click here to drop Kerry Hannon a note. How does understanding ourselves help us with our relationship to money? People struggle with shame and guilt around money. Those are the top two feelings that I talk about with my clients when it comes to money, and they’re dealing with it in isolation, white knuckling it through, especially if they are struggling financially or made some financial mistakes. The work is to start understanding where that negative talk is coming from. You can't get there unless you understand what your own motivations are, what you value and what your money beliefs are. Anything you would like to add? It’s imperative that women are in a position to know what's going on with their finances. That is all about options. I want you to save. I want your retirement to look good so that you can ride off into the sunset and have a beautiful life. But I also want you to be able to invest in people, communities, charities, companies that you really want to see make a difference in the world. And we cannot do that if we don't have the money because money is power. Kerry Hannon is a Senior Columnist at Yahoo Finance.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-predictions-for-the-space-economy-in-2025-150052650.html,"Sat, Nov 23, 2024, 7:00 AM","2025 could prove to be one of the most transformative years on record for the space economy. Between Elon Musk’s close ties with the incoming president, a new administration that is expected to be strongly pro-growth and anti-regulation, and the emergence of Starship, a rapidly reusable rocket that will shake up all the givens of accessing orbit, we are on the verge of significant changes that accelerate the growth of the space economy. There are pros and cons to these upcoming changes. On the one hand, a more pro-growth administration will reduce and simplify the abundance of federal and local regulations that hamper new launch and development efforts and increase the costs for businesses. It could also lead to even more privatization of US space operations and greater federal funding support for space companies developing dual-use technologies. On the other hand, strong deregulation could prioritize growth over environmental protections. It could also pose challenges to the Earth observation sector and other climate monitoring technology. Another key question is how much more dominant will SpaceX become in the next four years? The company is already the apex player in launch (the modern space economy wouldn’t even exist without the Falcon 9), so will its few competitors be innovative and strategic enough to keep up with the major growth that is coming? Musk’s close ties to the president-elect are only part of the equation here. The arrival of Starship will have a monumental impact on the space economy by accelerating growth in existing markets, enabling entirely new industries, and making existing infrastructure obsolete. As we look ahead, here are 10 predictions for the space capital markets in 2025. 1. The next four years Under the new administration, expect an even greater focus on promoting the space economy and on commercial space integration into government programs. Given Musk’s role in the administration and as one of the largest donors of the campaign, SpaceX will be the greatest beneficiary, but others will benefit as well, most notably from a light-touch regulatory regime for novel space activities overseen by the Commerce. 2. Starship comes online Starship will reach orbit and begin operational flights in the first half of 2025, carrying Starlink V2 satellites. With its rapidly accelerating test program reaching a nearly monthly launch cadence in 2024, Starship will double its flight rate in 2025, aided by less regulatory resistance from the FAA, which Musk will have influence over in his new role as the head of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. This vehicle will usher in the next phase of the space economy by significantly reducing the cost and complexity of payload missions; opening the door to crewed missions to the Moon and Mars, as well as lunar development; and setting the stage for emerging industries ranging from orbital habitats and manufacturing platforms to point-to-point travel and extended stay tourism in orbit and beyond. 3. Mars or bust Expect an acceleration of plans for a crewed landing on Mars using primarily SpaceX/Starship architecture, unlike the more complicated NASA-led architecture for Artemis. Support for Artemis will likely continue but will be accompanied by a major review and reconsideration of architecture. For example, a significant number of major programs, such as SLS, Orion, and ML2 are over budget, behind schedule, and/or otherwise troubled. However, any changes to SLS would likely cause domestic headaches, particularly at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala., which supports 24,000 jobs and manages the SLS program. Additionally, the Gateway was designed to accommodate international collaboration in the Artemis program but with an America-first approach, and this approach could find less support. 4. More competition for SpaceX despite a direct line to the White House Although SpaceX holds a dominant position in launch and satellite internet, 2025 will see competition emerge from several key players. Amazon’s (AMZN) Project Kuiper will begin operations next year, which poses the single greatest threat to Starlink’s market dominance. Direct-to-device connectivity will come online in 2025, with Starlink V2 and Apple (AAPL) moving to improve space-based communications for iPhones with a $1.7 billion investment in GlobalStar and AST SpaceMobile delivering for telecom partners like AT&T (T) and Verizon (VZ). Starlink will also see increased global competition from the Chinese G60/Thousand Sails constellation, which will see half of its first phase launched in 2025. New launch vehicles will also come online next year, including Rocket Lab’s (RKLB) Neutron and Blue Origin’s New Glenn. These will pose a direct challenge to the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, although Starship is poised to move the goalposts and supersede them. 5. Space Superiority Geopolitical strains continue to fuel an increase in US Defense spending, with benefits for the US Space Force (USSF), which will be accelerated under the new administration. We expect this to show up most clearly in Resilient Global Positioning Systems (R-GPS) and Alternative Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (AltPNT) as conflicts continue and China’s BeiDou continues to displace GPS in aligned countries. Through Starshield, the USSF will increasingly rely on SpaceX for national security missions across GPS, geospatial intelligence, satellite communications (SatCom), space domain awareness, in-space transportation, and more. The establishment of a Space National Guard is inevitable under the new administration and will further expand public-commercial alliances and technology integrations. 6. Incumbents adjust to the new world order In 2025, Boeing (BA) and Airbus (AIR.PA) will sell off their space businesses after failing to keep up with the pace of change. These divestitures by entrenched government contractors mark a pivotal moment in the space economy, as it changes the competitive landscape, establishes a new power broker system, and creates new opportunities and risks in the government’s extended capabilities in space. Meanwhile, expect an acceleration in SatCom M&A as leading incumbents — such as SES (SES) and Intelsat (combined in 2024), DirectTV and Dish (2024), Viasat and Inmarsat (2023), Eutelsat and OneWeb (2023) — push for greater consolidation to better compete with Starlink and other new non-geostationary satellite orbit (NGSO) entrants. 7. Connecting the digital and physical worlds Over the next year, artificial intelligence will continue to transform capabilities across the space economy, but it will be most prevalent in “spatial intelligence” as it facilitates the integration of geospatial data into Big Tech. The successful integration of MapBox with OpenAI’s ChatGPT search is just one early example of the possibilities evolving in this marketplace. World Labs, founded by AI pioneer Fei-Fei Li, has raised $230 million to develop spatially intelligent large world models (LWMs) that can understand and reason about the 3D world from images and other modalities. Companies are already in a race to automate systems that enable proliferated architecture, and AI is the only real solution to the bottleneck. Expect these efforts to accelerate dramatically in 2025, particularly due to stronger federal support for Big Tech and AI innovation as the next administration looks to increase its lead over China. 8. Coordination of orbital traffic goes from elective to essential While China has launched a lot of rockets to date, it still only comprises a small percentage of the total global mass to orbit. Expect that to change in 2025 as Chinese mega-constellations like G60, Geely, and more begin to launch in earnest. The exponential growth in satellites in orbit (currently faster than Moore’s Law) will force the conversation of coordination despite geopolitical tensions. Due to the US government’s restrictions on direct collaboration with China, these efforts will be led by private industry. This will create a new wave of privatization in space traffic coordination and there is a strong probability that the Commerce Department’s Traffic Coordination System for Space (TraCSS) program will either be canceled or significantly restructured to emphasize commercial data. 9. Political climate Under the next administration, the US is about to make a sharp turn on climate policy, which will have negative impacts on certain environmental protections and new efforts by geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) companies to improve climate monitoring and solutions. The biggest risks for the GEOINT industry are a reduction in federal funding and specific programs, like NASA's Earth Observing System (EOS) and NOAA’s Modeling, Analysis, Predictions, and Projections (MAPP) programs, as well as an overall challenge (and perhaps dismantling) of environmental, social, and governance (ESG) incentives for businesses and investors. At the same time, extreme weather events like heat waves, floods, and wildfires will become increasingly frequent, impacting more people and further straining insurance markets. Private capital will have to step up to continue to fund energy transition and climate projects, like MethaneSAT and FireSAT, in an effort to fill the gap left by cuts in climate change and civil Earth observation programs by the new administration. 10. Play stations Whoever buys Boeing’s International Space Station (ISS) operations business will continue their push for an extension of the ISS beyond 2030. Meanwhile, Vast will launch its Haven station in 2025, providing an exit option for a government program that is underfunded and unwanted. The current administration has already been rethinking its Commercial Low Earth Orbit Development Program (CLD), and that skepticism is likely to intensify in the next administration. The reality is that space stations are extremely costly and difficult to maintain, and Starship provides an effective alternative that checks a number of key boxes: It's less expensive, easier and faster to launch and become operational, and you can have multiple stations for less than the cost of one ISS today. Between the practicality of Starship and Musk’s influence in the White House, there is a strong possibility that space stations will become another SpaceX domain. While the last decade has seen remarkable progress in the space economy, the next four years will experience many dramatic changes — beginning with a rapid phaseout of incumbents and new political priorities in 2025. The space economy is poised for a surge in growth and development that will be fueled by deregulation and enhanced US defense spending, but the disruptive effects of Starship, as well as SpaceX’s growing influence over federal policy, will have far-reaching impacts across many space industries. Chad Anderson is the managing partner of Space Capital and an investor in SpaceX, along with dozens of other space companies. Between 2019 and 2021, Anderson went to the White House on a quarterly basis to provide data on the space economy, and he also joined National Space Council meetings, so he has insights on how the next administration will move forward on space.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-picks-scott-bessent-the-investor-favorite-for-treasury-secretary-000710469.html,"Fri, Nov 22, 2024, 4:07 PM","President-elect Donald Trump announced Friday evening that investor Scott Bessent will be his nominee for Treasury secretary, picking a campaign trail partner and early frontrunner for the job after a long and contentious process. Trump called him ""one of the World's foremost International Investors"" in his announcement, adding that he is ""a strong advocate of the America First agenda."" Bessent beat out a series of other candidates from former Federal Reserve governor Kevin Warsh to Apollo Global Management (APO) CEO Marc Rowan to cap a drawn-out process that saw candidates’ chances seem to rise and fall by the day. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management). Assuming he is indeed nominated and then confirmed, Bessent will face the difficult challenge in the months ahead of simultaneously working to calm US and global markets while also being tasked with selling many of the president-elect's economic plans. The issue is that many of those ideas remain unpopular in business world corners — specifically renewed tariffs and, perhaps, increased deficit spending. In a live Yahoo Finance video appearance earlier on Friday, Hoover Institution fellow Lanhee Chen offered that Trump's nominee would need to be well-qualified, aligned with his economic agenda, and also serve as ""a calming force to markets."" From the beginning of the process, Bessent was often viewed as the front-runner for the post, but saw his fortunes rise and fall. The former Soros Fund Management investing chief met with Trump multiple times in the weeks following the election after being a regular campaign trail partner of the president-elect. The race was anything but drama-free, with betting markets have yo-yoing in recent days and Polymarket odds putting three different candidates as the favorite at various points. Trump ended up settling on the figure who often appeared with him on the campaign trail, citing Bessent's expertise before rally crowds, specifically the notion that stocks were on the rise because of the prospects of a Trump victory. Trump described Bessent's mission Friday as one to help ""usher in a new Golden Era for the United States,"" including the stopping of trade imbalances. Bessent is currently the CEO of Key Square Capital Management and made a notably public case for the job since Trump's victory. At various points in recent weeks, Bessent was live on the set of Fox and Friends offering ""any way I can help,"" and appearing with Trump ally Steve Bannon to discuss his vision for the US economy. He also published op-eds in the Wall Street Journal and on FoxNews.com to discuss issues close to the president-elect. Bessent has also donated more than $3.1 million to Trump and other Republicans during the recent election season, according to government records. Evercore ISI in a note to clients this week called Bessent ""the investor favorite given his knowledge of macro and markets and his credibility with the bond market."" During Trump's first term, the Treasury secretary role was a rare area of relative stability and persistent influence throughout the term, with Steven Mnuchin holding the post for Trump's entire term even as turnover at the White House and other Cabinet agencies was rampant. Mnuchin, who was succeeded by current Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, also found himself at the center of an array of issues, notably the negotiations that led to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Many provisions of that law expire at the end of 2025, leaving Bessent to likely assume a central role on the same issue. Ben Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/a-resale-pioneers-plan-to-stay-in-business-for-a-century-140254761.html,"Fri, Nov 22, 2024, 6:02 AM","Only 30% of family businesses make it to the second generation. One reason is that nearly half of owners who expect to retire within five years do not have a successor in place. Secondhand clothing retailer Buffalo Exchange bucked that trend when Rebecca Block took over as CEO in 2024. Block’s parents, Kerstin and Spencer, launched the business with a single store in Tucson, Ariz., in 1974, when the used clothing market was still nascent. “The whole concept of thrift and secondhand clothing has changed enormously in the last 50 years,” Block told Yahoo Finance. “People don't view used clothing as a stigma. They view it as a source of pride.” The buy, sell, trade retailer has grown with the popularity of the industry, expanding to 41 locations across 15 states with annual revenue hovering around $100 million per year. Over the same span, the company has successfully navigated the concept, startup, and growth stages of forming a business. Recently it has taken on the transform or exit stage, where entrepreneurs evaluate whether to retire, sell the business, or pass the company to the next generation. As Block plots her company's future as a second-generation owner, she plans to combine what has worked in the past with modern data to make key decisions, like choosing new store locations. “We do try very hard to be in communities that have student populations, and then we look in places that are kind of alternative,” Block, said. “We moved into demographics research and figuring out what are really our customers based on the stores that we have, and then we could look for those demographics in other areas.” Block is also working to modernize Buffalo Exchange to compete against the rise of digital players in the recycled fashion market. The company has tried to sell clothes online on three occasions, but Block said it wasn’t economical for the business. Instead, the company has decided to lean into its brick-and-mortar identity. ""I just don't think that when you're online, you're getting an experience,"" she said. ""You're looking at things, but you're not really having a tactile, sensational experience with the items in a fun environment."" Buffalo Exchange's change of hands from mother to daughter officially happened in early 2024, but the handover process was almost a decade in the making, a strategy that generally leads to a smoother transition, according to NYU Stern School of Business professor Thomaï Serdari. “It is always better to take longer to set up the succession plan and ensure that the new generation feels comfortable,” Serdari said. This kind of planning is crucial as the company looks ahead to its next 50 years, which may require defying even steeper odds, as only 12% of family businesses make it to the third generation. To make this happen, Block is following a proven recipe for the business and integrating her potential successor, her daughter Melissa, into the business sooner rather than later.

Shares of Super Micro — the AI server maker that uses Nvidia's (NVDA) chips and has a major deal with Elon Musk's xAI — rose 11.6% in Friday trading to roughly $33. Even with that gain, shares are still far below highs above $120 in March following SMCI’s addition to the S&P 500. The stock’s rally kicked off Monday in anticipation of Super Micro’s submission of a compliance plan to the Nasdaq (^IXIC) as it looks to avoid delisting. Shares skyrocketed when the company officially announced it had submitted the plan and hired a new auditor, BDO. Super Micro's prior accountant, Ernst & Young, resigned in late October. Super Micro has been grappling with the fallout from an August report by short seller firm Hindenburg Research, which pointed to alleged accounting malpractices, violations of export controls, and shady relationships between top executives and Super Micro partners. Following the Hindenburg report, Super Micro delayed filing its annual 10-K and most recent quarterly 10-Q reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which put the company at risk of being delisted from the Nasdaq. Super Micro is also reportedly being investigated by the Department of Justice. The deluge of bad news has sent shares tumbling over the last few months. EY’s resignation, in particular, pushed Super Micro stock down more than 30% in a single day in late October. The accountant wrote in its resignation letter that it was ""unwilling to be associated with the financial statements prepared by [Super Micro] management.” Adding to its woes, Super Micro’s fiscal first quarter earnings report on Nov. 5 missed Wall Street’s expectations. As Wedbush analyst Matthew Bryson wrote in a note to investors at the time, the company blamed lighter sales on delays of Nvidia’s Blackwell AI chips and issues with its SEC filings. Bryson maintains a Neutral rating on the stock and recently lowered his price target for shares to $24 from $32. Other firms such as Barclays (BCS), Wells Fargo (WFC), and KeyBanc have suspended coverage of the stock. Super Micro said Monday that it is on track to submit delayed filings to the SEC ""and become current with its periodic reports within the discretionary period available to the Nasdaq staff to grant."" Wedbush’s Bryson wrote in a separate note on Nov. 19 in response to Monday's news, “We see retaining a new auditor is a significant positive step for SMCI as it resolves perhaps the most substantial concern regarding SMCI's ability to remain listed … and creates a potential path for SMCI to file its financials and restore NASDAQ compliance.” He added that “even if the best case scenario plays out, we believe EY's resignation will necessarily still create some lingering concerns around the health of SMCI's financials,” given concerns about the reported DOJ investigation, questionable relationships between Super Micro’s top executives and its customers and suppliers, and its new accountant BDO’s own regulatory issues. Super Micro shares this week were also helped by Nvidia’s blowout earnings report and the company’s assurances that Blackwell production is on pace. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang gave Super Micro a shoutout during the AI chipmaker’s earnings call, mentioning SMCI as one of its “great partners.” Friday's stock move means SMCI short sellers are now down $1.4 billion in mark-to-market losses since shares hit a year-to-date low of $18.01 on Nov. 14, according to data from S3 Partners. ""SMCI is turning into a squeezable stock, with short sellers’ buy-to-covers arm-in-arm with long buyers pushing SMCI’s stock price higher,"" S3 Partners Managing Director Ihor Dusaniwsky told Yahoo Finance.

Craig Newmark, the 71-year-old founder and former CEO of classifieds site Craigslist, is alarmed about potential cybersecurity risks in the US. “The deal is our country is under attack now,” he told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on the Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in below). “It’s not like I’m in the recruiting line after Pearl Harbor because my dad volunteered in the '40s, but I guess that’s what I should be doing.” Newmark, who stepped down from the company in 2000 but kept a position answering customer complaints, has foregone reaping financial rewards in semi-retirement. Instead, he started Craig Newmark Philanthropies to primarily invest in projects to protect critical American infrastructure from cyberattacks. He told Sozzi he is now spending $200 million more to address the issue, on top of an initial $100 million pledge revealed in September of this year. He encouraged other wealthy people to join him in the fight against cyberattacks. “I tell people, 'Hey, the people who protect us could use some help. The amounts of money comparatively are small, so why not help out,'” he said. Cybersecurity has had a banner year in the spotlight, with issues going beyond past annoyances where consumers simply need to change passwords, call a credit bureau, or cancel an account after a breach. This past summer, a Microsoft (MSFT) Windows update containing a defect hit 8.5 million computers. It resulted in flight cancellations and hampered health and payment services. Concerns swirled about potential infrastructure attacks on a global scale, such as the Paris Olympics. In October, utility company American Water Works (AWK) announced a cybersecurity attack that temporarily shut down its customer portal and paused billing. Shares of cybersecurity stocks have subsequently soared: Palo Alto Networks (PANW) and CyberArk Software (CYBR) are up 38% and 53% year to date, respectively. Wall Street is staying bullish on each stock, according to Yahoo Finance analyst recommendation and price target data. The global financial impact of cybercrimes could reach $13.82 trillion by 2028 from $9.22 trillion in 2024, the Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia estimated. The need for municipalities and other government entities to act rather than react remains paramount, warns Newmark. “I think a lot about this,” said Newmark. “I’ve started to fund networks of smart volunteers who can help people protect infrastructure, particularly [for] the small companies and utilities across the country who are responsible for most of our electrical and power supplies, transportation infrastructure, [and] food distribution.” “A lot of these systems have no protection, so an adversary could just compromise them, saying unless you do what we need, we can start shutting off these things,” he continued. Should that happen, recovery “could take weeks and weeks without your water supply or electricity."" Newmark is a self-professed tech nerd. The IBM alum worked at Big Blue for 17 years before founding Craigslist in 1995. While he continues to follow Craigslist from afar, Newmark said these days he's most focused on ensuring his wealth ends up at the correct causes. ""My deal is that I want all that money to go straight to the nonprofit world — I just have to figure out where that goes and how do I handle it over the next five to 20 years,"" Newmark said.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-f1s-las-vegas-grand-prix-will-be-bigger-and-better-than-last-year-215928900.html,"Sat, Nov 23, 2024, 5:00 AM","The Formula 1 circus lands on the Vegas Strip this weekend for the second annual Las Vegas Grand Prix. Last year’s race was plagued by complaining residents and businesses over traffic, city obstructions, and a race track that damaged Carlos Sainz’s Ferrari when a manhole came loose, requiring a very expensive repair. Nonetheless, the actual race was quite exciting, and screaming F1 race cars created the look and feel that Las Vegas, and F1 owner Liberty Media, hoped to create. With a more tightly contested championship among drivers and teams at the top this year, the anticipation is growing. Liberty Media’s (FWONK) gamble on the US, and in particular Vegas, where Liberty has spent a whopping $600 million to develop for a 10-year race deal, appears worth taking. While experts predict this year’s race will pull in slightly less than the $500 million or so in revenue for Formula 1 and the $1.5 billion in Las Vegas economic impact achieved in last year’s race, the contest and its weeklong festivities will still be a boon for all those involved. The 300,000 or so attendees expected for the race tend to spend nearly four times as much as regular Vegas visitors, the city said. And that’s good for F1, the city, and, of course, the teams that actually do the racing. “It'll be bigger and better than last year,” Williams F1 team principal James Vowles said to Yahoo Finance. “There was some teething issues; that’s fairly normal when you're trying to put together the scale of operation that Formula 1 is, and you have to say that the three US races, but especially Las Vegas, it is just this jewel in the crown of what we have across the whole calendar, and it could be that we have a championship decided this weekend. So it's ... sort of excitement that brings it all together,” Vowles added. BWT Alpine F1 team principal Oliver Oakes believes Liberty Media is the main driver behind F1’s recent success in Vegas and the sport overall in the US, which really emerged during the pandemic and following the release of the Netflix F1 series, “Drive to Survive.” “[Liberty Media has] done an amazing sort of job bringing the sport to everybody. I think everyone talks about ‘Drive to Survive’ and the effect that’s had, but actually I think it goes much ... wider than that,” Oakes told Yahoo Finance. “You can see now every event in F1 is a three- or four-day weekend, whether that’s sprint races thrown in, whether that’s concerts on event, it’s fantastic. And they’ve been the ones driving this growth.” Both Williams and Alpine are interesting stories in F1 this year. Neither team is fighting for the championship; they are “midfield” fighters this year, with Alpine leapfrogging Willams after a surprise double-podium race finish last week at Interlagos in Brazil. While Alpine might be higher up in the rankings, or Constructor Standings as F1 calls them, Williams is ascending. The team has signed a number of high-profile partners in the last couple of years, with Duracell (BRK-B), Gulf Oil, Michelob (BUD), and Broadcom (AVGO) among the big names. The team signed Japanese industrial giant Komatsu (KMTUY) and Latin America e-commerce site MercadoLibre (MELI) this year, as well as re-signing energy company Gulf Oil. The team is also majority-owned by US-based private equity firm Dorilton Capital. Vowles believes Dorilton is an asset for the team, surprising given the reputation of sharp-elbowed PE operators. ""This is not what I would call traditional private equity; this is not about getting a multiple and selling out. This is about bringing a team back to where it deserves to be, winning world championships,” Vowles said about the team’s ownership structure. Vowles added that he has learned a lot from Dorilton on how to transform an organization from the ground up, and the VC firm has provided Williams with investments it needs both now and for funding projects that may take years to pay off. Vowles also said, surprisingly, that he speaks to Williams' board of directors almost every day. Alpine F1 is another interesting story. The team is majority-owned by French automaker Renault (RNLSY), and the name Alpine refers to Renault’s storied performance brand. But the team is in the midst of a transformation too. It has taken on new ownership in the form of big celebrities and sports icons like actor Ryan Reynolds, NFL quarterback Patrick Mahomes, and top golfer Rory McIlroy. The team also decided to no longer build its own engines and will instead get its engine supply through Mercedes, which Williams F1 does as well. The changes at Alpine have led to rumors that the team is up for sale, with suitors like GM reportedly knocking at the door. Though he didn’t directly deny that the team was for sale, similar to Williams' Vowles, Oakes believes the right structure and ownership are in place. “I think actually people can really see now that the backing from Luca [De Meo, Renault CEO], from the group, the sort of direction we’ve taken with going out to get the best engine, to put the team really, front foot forward and climbing back up the grid — I think it’s exciting times for the team,” Oakes said. “You know, for the first time, I think there’s some real leadership there as well and real support, so it’s looking good for the future,” he added.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rising-price-paying-national-debt-124058886.html,"Sun, Nov 24, 2024, 4:40 AM","WASHINGTON (AP) — Donald Trump has big plans for the economy — and a big debt problem that will be a hurdle to delivering on them. Trump has bold ideas on tax cuts, tariffs and other programs, but high interest rates and the price of repaying the federal government’s existing debt could limit what he’s able to do. Not only is the federal debt at roughly $36 trillion, but the spike in inflation after the coronavirus pandemic has pushed up the government's borrowing costs such that debt service next year will easily exceed spending on national security. The higher cost of servicing the debt gives Trump less room to maneuver with the federal budget as he seeks income tax cuts. It's also a political challenge because higher interest rates have made it costlier for many Americans to buy a home or new automobile. And the issue of high costs helped Trump reclaim the presidency in November's election. “It's clear the current amount of debt is putting upward pressure on interest rates, including mortgage rates for instance,"" said Shai Akabas, executive director of the economic policy program at the Bipartisan Policy Center. “The cost of housing and groceries is going to be increasingly felt by households in a way that are going to adversely affect our economic prospects in the future.” Akabas stressed that the debt service is already starting to crowd out government spending on basic needs such as infrastructure and education. About 1 in 5 dollars spent by the government are now repaying investors for borrowed money, instead of enabling investments in future economic growth. It's an issue on Trump's radar. In his statement on choosing billionaire investor Scott Bessent to be his treasury secretary, the Republican president-elect said Bessent would “help curb the unsustainable path of Federal Debt.” The debt service costs along with the higher total debt complicate Trump's efforts to renew his 2017 tax cuts, much of which are set to expire after next year. The higher debt from those tax cuts could push interest rates higher, making debt service even costlier and minimizing any benefits the tax cuts could produce for growth. “Clearly, it's irresponsible to run back the same tax cuts after the deficit has tripled,” said Brian Riedl, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and a former Republican congressional aide. “Even congressional Republicans behind the scenes are looking for ways to scale down the president’s ambitions.” Democrats and many economists say Trump's income tax cuts disproportionately benefit the wealthy, which deprives the government of revenues needed for programs for the middle class and poor. ""The president-elect’s tax policy ideas will increase the deficit because they will decrease taxes for those with the highest ability to pay, such as the corporations whose tax rate he’s proposed reducing even further to 15%,” said Jessica Fulton, vice president of policy at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a Washington-based think tank that deals with issues facing communities of color. Trump's team insists he can make the math work. “The American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail, including lowering prices. He will deliver,” said Karoline Leavitt, the Trump transition spokeswoman. When Trump was last in the White House in 2020, the federal government was spending $345 billion annually to service the national debt. It was possible to run up the national debt with tax cuts and pandemic aid because the average interest rate was low, such that repayment costs were manageable even as debt levels climbed. Congressional Budget Office projections indicate that debt service costs next year could exceed $1 trillion. That's more than projected spending on defense. The total is also greater than nondefense spending on infrastructure, food aid and other programs under the direction of Congress. What fueled the increased cost of servicing the debt has been higher interest rates. In April 2020, when the government was borrowing trillions of dollars to address the pandemic, the yield on 10-year Treasury notes fell as low as 0.6%. They're now 4.4%, having increasing since September as investors expect Trump to add several trillions of dollars onto projected deficits with his income tax cuts. Democratic President Joe Biden can point to strong economic growth and successfully avoiding a recession as the Federal Reserve sought to bring down inflation. Still, deficits ran at unusually high levels during his term. That's due in part to his own initiatives to boost manufacturing and address climate change, and to the legacy of Trump's previous tax cuts. People in Trump's orbit, as well as Republican lawmakers, are already scouting out ways to reduce government spending in order to minimize the debt and bring down interest rates. They have attacked Biden for the deficits and inflation, setting the stage for whether they can persuade Trump to take action. Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, the wealthy businessmen leading Trump's efforts to cut government costs, have proposed that the incoming administration should simply refuse to spend some of the money approved by Congress. It's an idea that Trump has also backed, but one that would likely provoke challenges in court as it would undermine congressional authority. Russell Vought, the White House budget director during Trump's first term and Trump's choice to lead it again, put out an alternative proposed budget for 2023 with more than $11 trillion in spending cuts over 10 years in order to potentially generate a surplus. Michael Faulkender, a finance professor who served in Trump's Treasury Department, told a congressional committee in March that all the energy and environmental components of Biden's Inflation Reduction Act from 2022 should be repealed to reduce deficits. Trump has also talked up tariffs on imports to generate revenues and reduce deficits, while some Republican lawmakers such as House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington, R-Texas, have discussed adding work requirements to trim Medicaid expenses. The White House was last pressured by high rates to address debt service costs roughly three decades ago during the start of Democrat Bill Clinton's presidency. Higher yields on the 10-year Treasury notes led Clinton and Congress to reach an agreement on deficit reduction, ultimately producing a budget surplus starting in 1998. Clinton political adviser James Carville joked at the time about how bond investors pushing up borrowing rates for the U.S. government could humble the commander in chief. “I used to think that if there was reincarnation, I wanted to come back as the president or the pope or as a .400 baseball hitter,"" Carville said. ""But now I would like to come back as the bond market. You can intimidate everybody.” (Bloomberg) -- The junk-bond rally in emerging markets risks being just an interlude between the debt crisis of the past four years and a new bout of distress in the next four, if Donald Trump does what he says he will.Most Read from BloombergNYC's Underground Steam System May Be Key to a Greener FutureNYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion PledgeIn Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the FieldNYC Mayor Adams Names Jessica Tisch to Lead Police Hea The outcome of elections can shape policies and decisions for years to come, and it's no exception in the U.S. Following Donald Trump's election as the 47th president of the United States and Republicans gaining control of the Senate and the House of Representatives, some companies and industries could potentially benefit from the change in administration at the national level.

U.S. President Joe Biden has cited the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act as helping to push his sweeping infrastructure agenda and create more jobs nationwide. ""We passed legislation to rebuild our infrastructure, build a clean energy economy, and bring manufacturing back to the United States after decades of offshoring,"" Biden said. ""These investments in industries of the future are ensuring the future is made in America, by American workers. And they’re creating opportunities in communities too often left behind."" Subsidies provided under these laws have lured a number of chipmakers and other companies to create or expand production facilities in the United States. Still, the investments were not enough for Biden's fellow Democrats, who lost control of the White House and the U.S. Senate in this month's election and failed to recapture the U.S. House of Representatives. Some Democrats have blamed the loss on economic concerns and a disconnect from voters despite policies designed to boost the working and middle class, such as efforts to address price gouging and support for unions. Republican U.S. President-elect Donald Trump capitalized on consumers' desire for lower prices even as he pledged to impose tariffs ranging from 20% to 60% and to implement mass deportations that could impact various industries, particularly the food and agricultural sectors. Americans see inflation as a critical issue and want Trump to tackle rising prices within his first 100 days in office, a Reuters/Ispos poll last week found.

It was the monetary policy committee’s seventh straight hold and its last meeting for 2024. The next rate decision is scheduled for early January. The US and Israeli officials have said that talks on a cease-fire with Lebanese-based Hezbollah militants have made progress in the past week. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government is yet to announce a deal. Governor Amir Yaron has said inflationary pressures brought on by the conflicts against Hamas and Hezbollah will likely keep rate cuts off the table until the second half of 2025. The country’s annual inflation stood at 3.5% as of October, above the government’s target range of 1% to 3%. That’s largely due to supply-side constraints. The construction and agriculture sectors have been hit by a shortage of Palestinian workers who are banned from entering Israel, causing rent and food prices to rise significantly over the past year. Israel’s aviation market has also suffered with many international carriers avoiding the country. That’s sent airfare costs soaring. Inflation may accelerate to as much as 4% after a value added tax increase in January and probably won’t fall back into the bank’s target range before the end of 2025, according to Yoni Fanning, a strategist in Tel Aviv at Mizrahi Tefahot Bank. At the same time, the central bank sees the economy growing just 0.5% this year, down from its earlier projection of 1.5%.

John Fernald, economist emeritus at the San Francisco Fed and a professor at INSEAD in Fountainebleau, France, has long been cautious about extrapolating from short-term trends to conclude that the U.S. is entering a new period of breakout productivity growth like that from 1995 to 2004, which enabled big economic gains without inflation. Some Fed policymakers and analysts have expressed the hope that generative artificial intelligence and other innovations may already be setting the nation up for such a period, which lays the groundwork for improvements in living standards.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/california-could-offer-electric-vehicle-160946164.html,"Mon, Nov 25, 2024, 2:17 PM","SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California could offer rebates for electric vehicle purchases if the incoming Trump administration eliminates a federal tax credit for people who buy electric cars, Gov. Gavin Newsom said Monday. Newsom, a Democrat, proposed creating a new version of the state’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program, which was phased out in 2023 after funding 594,000 cars and saving 456 million gallons of fuel, Newsom’s office said. “Consumers continue to prove the skeptics wrong – zero-emission vehicles are here to stay,"" Newsom said in a statement. ""We’re not turning back on a clean transportation future — we’re going to make it more affordable for people to drive vehicles that don’t pollute.” Newsom’s proposal is part of his plan to protect California's progressive policies ahead of Republican President-elect Donald Trump's second term. He called the state Legislature to convene in a special session to help “Trump-proof” state laws by giving the attorney general’s office more funding to fight federal challenges. But a budget shortfall could complicate California’s resistance efforts. Early budget projections show the state could face a $2 billion deficit next year, according to a report released last week by the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office. That’s an improvement from an estimated $46.8 billion deficit the state faced last year, but the shortfall could still curtail the state’s ability to expand new programs and fight federal legal challenges. Legislative leaders in both chambers have said the state needs to stay prudent in anticipation of future budget deficits. Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for Trump's transition team, said the president-elect would deliver on his campaign promises, “including stopping attacks on gas-powered cars.” “When he takes office, President Trump will support the auto industry, allowing space for both gas-powered cars AND electric vehicles,” she said in a statement. Money for the new rebate system could come from the state's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which is funded by polluters under the state’s cap-and-trade program, the governor's office said. Officials didn’t say how much the program would cost or how the rebates would work. California has surpassed 2 million zero-emission vehicles sold, according to Newsom's office. The state has passed policies in recent years to transition away from fossil fuel-powered cars, trucks, trains and lawn mowers. Trump previously vowed to end federal electric vehicle tax credits, which are worth up to $7,500 for new zero-emission vehicles. There’s also a $4,000 credit for used ones. But Trump later softened his stance as Tesla CEO Elon Musk became a supporter and adviser. Newsom's proposed rebates could exclude Tesla and other automakers in an effort to promote more market competition and innovation, according to the governor's office. But that is subject to negotiation with the state Legislature. Musk called Tesla's possible exclusion “insane” in a post on X. About 42% of rebates went to people buying or leasing Tesla vehicles under the state's previous clean vehicle rebate program, according to data from the California Air Resources Board. Trump criticized Newsom on social media after the governor called for a special session, calling out the high cost of living in California and the state’s homelessness crisis. Trump said Newsom was “stopping all of the GREAT things that can be done to ‘Make California Great Again.’” Newsom said on his podcast earlier this month that he reached out to Trump after the election. He said at a news conference last week that he still hadn’t heard back from the president-elect. California's defunct Clean Vehicle Rebate Program offered rebates on electric cars as high as $2,500. The outlook for the U.S. economy is improving, according to a group of leading economists, and investors can thank the Federal Reserve and the incoming Trump administration. The Tesla billionaire and co-head of the Department of Government Efficiency says he wants workers in the office five days a week. “Meanwhile, some idiots are still building manned fighter jets like the F-35,” Musk posted on X. Is retirement on your radar?  Before calling it quits and initiating your Social Security retirement payments in 2025, however, there's one thing you'll want to do -- weigh the financial cost of claiming benefits now instead of waiting.

The Moody’s rating is now above those of Fitch Ratings and S&P Global Ratings. The Gulf country now stands on par with the likes of Hong Kong and Belguim, according to Moody’s, which changed its outlook for the kingdom to stable from positive. “The upgrade reflects our assessment that economic diversification has continued to progress, and the momentum will be sustained,” Moody’s said in its statement. “Continued progress will, over time, further reduce Saudi Arabia’s exposure to oil market developments and long-term carbon transition.” The rating company said the stable outlook “indicates balanced risks to the rating at a higher level.” Still, “progress in the large diversification projects may crowd-in the private sector and spur the development of non-hydrocarbon sectors at a faster pace than we currently assume,” Moody’s analysts said. They expect the country’s non-oil economy to average between 4% and 5% in coming years, in line with government estimates. The Gulf kingdom has been running consecutive quarterly budget deficits and is forecast to have annual fiscal shortfalls for years to come, according to government figures. The Saudi government has also ramped up debt issuances this year. Its debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to rise to 35% by 2030, according to Moody’s Economic output is now seen growing less than 1% this year, down from a prior forecast of 4.4%, according to government figures, while projections for 2025-2026 have also been significantly scaled back. Despite the kingdom’s upgrade and positive fiscal indicators, “global growth and broader oil market developments are not conducive to high levels of public spending,” according to the Moody’s statement. “A large decline in oil prices or production could intensify the trade-off between progress in economic diversification and fiscal prudence, potentially leading to a weaker sovereign balance sheet than we currently assume.” Ongoing regional conflict may also pose risks for the sovereign’s outlook, according to the rating company.

In an op-ed published by the Wall Street Journal, the billionaire appointed to head up the new Department of Government Efficiency (D.O.G.E) along with his co-lead Vivek Ramaswamy, laid out plans to reduce the overall size of the government and cut costs. And one part of that blueprint included mandating a full return-to-office for all Federal workers. “Requiring federal employees to come to the office five days a week would result in a wave of voluntary terminations that we welcome: If federal employees don’t want to show up, American taxpayers shouldn’t pay them for the COVID-era privilege of staying home,"" they wrote. In doing so, Musk and Ramaswamy seem to be openly announcing what some critics have long argued is a disguised impetus behind strict RTO mandates: Job cuts. One survey this year of more than 1,500 U.S. managers found that a quarter of C-suite executives were hoping that return-to-office policies would encourage employees to voluntarily quit. After all, it’s certainly cheaper than having to do layoffs and pay severance. Other CEOs have discussed potential attrition due to five-day RTO mandates. Last month, Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman told staffers during an all-hands meeting that it’s “OK” if people don’t want to work in an office environment because there are “other companies around.” That led many employees to sign an open letter to corporate leadership noting his remarks were “inconsistent with the experiences of many employees” and “misrepresenting the realities of working at Amazon.” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy pushed back against allegations that the company’s RTO requirement was an excuse to lay off workers and said the decision was “not a cost play.” The Federal government is the nation’s largest employer, with over 2.2 million civilian staffers. Until now, each agency has been able to decide what workplace policy works best for them. Of the total number of Federal workers, roughly half work on-site, according to an August report from the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. While remaining employees are eligible for remote work, the report found that only 228,000, or roughly 10%, were in remote positions where there was no expectation that they work in-person. And those who have the option to work remotely spent about 60% of working hours in-person at various job sites. It's unclear if Musk and Ramaswamy will actually be able to implement a five-day RTO for Federal workers. And of course, the question remains: Will these CEOs return to the office themselves?

His firm expects a renewed maximum-pressure campaign from the US against Iran to take offline production of roughly 500,000 barrels per day. But a “whole-hog” effort could succeed in curtailing Iranian oil exports by 1 million to 1.2 million barrels per day, which would also remove the threat of oversupply forecast for the global crude market next year, according to McNally. Iran said it will increase its nuclear fuel-making capacity after it was censured by the United Nations atomic watchdog, ratcheting up tensions with the West just days after it signaled a willingness to ease them. Iran’s earlier attempt at compromise was seen by some as an olive branch toward President-elect Donald Trump. Now, with the watchdog on the clock to produce a report that can be used to revive UN sanctions, Trump has the potential to inflict more pain on the Persian Gulf nation’s economy than he did during his first term. Oil prices in New York are up about 4% this quarter, trading near $70 a barrel, partly on increased global geopolitical tensions. Trump will also likely persist with the current administration’s efforts to dampen Russian energy exports, McNally said. A resolution to the Russia-Ukraine war might entail “an armistice, but no peace treaty, no ending of sanctions,” he said said. “If anything, sanctions are getting tighter, not looser.” Tighter sanctions that limit global energy supplies might come at odds with Trump’s campaign pledge to reduce domestic gasoline prices by slashing regulations on US oil producers. “The only option any US president has to increase oil supply is to call OPEC+ leadership and successfully convince them to open the taps,” McNally said. “Believe me, I looked for the magic wand years ago,” he added, referring to his time as an energy adviser in the George W.

Edward Kim, who is currently serving as Williams' deputy, will take over on an acting basis as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. Williams' office has an unusual degree of independence from the Justice Department and is known for bringing high-profile financial fraud and public corruption cases. Trump, a Republican, earlier this month said he would nominate former Securities and Exchange Commission chair Jay Clayton to lead the office. The position requires confirmation by the U.S. Senate. During his tenure, Williams secured convictions of former billionaire financiers on fraud charges - which he has long indicated was a top priority. One-time cryptocurrency executive Sam Bankman-Fried was found guilty last November on charges of stealing about $8 billion from customers of his FTX exchange, and Archegos Capital Management founder Sung Kook ""Bill"" Hwang was convicted in July of manipulating stock markets, costing Wall Street banks billions. Bankman-Fried and Hwang both deny wrongdoing. ""I am confident I am leaving at a time when the office is functioning at an incredibly high level – upholding and exceeding its already high standard of excellence, integrity, and independence,"" Williams said in a statement. Williams has also sharpened his office's focus on public corruption. In July, he secured the conviction of former New Jersey Democratic Senator Bob Menendez on charges of fraud and acting as a foreign agent. In September, he brought bribery charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, also a Democrat. Menendez has vowed to appeal, and Adams has pleaded not guilty. A ROCKY RELATIONSHIP Williams, the office's first Black U.S. Attorney, took office in late 2021. He led the Southern District of New York's securities and commodities task force before being nominated to the district's top post by President Joe Biden. He once clerked for former Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens, as well as current Attorney General Merrick Garland when Garland was an appellate judge. In resigning before Trump takes office, Williams will avoid potentially suffering the fate of one of his predecessors, Preet Bharara, who was fired as U.S. Attorney in early 2017 soon after Trump became president. Bharara, appointed to his position by Democratic President Barack Obama in 2009, has said Trump initially asked him to stay on. Trump had a rocky relationship with Bharara's successor, Geoffrey Berman, whose office secured a guilty plea from Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen and indicted two associates of former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Williams' office closed a probe into Giuliani without bringing charges. Berman wrote in a 2022 memoir that the Trump administration sought to pressure him to bring criminal charges against political opponents. ""Throughout my tenure as U.S. Attorney, Trump's Justice Department kept demanding that I use my office to aid them politically, and I kept declining,"" Berman wrote. During his successful 2024 presidential election campaign, Trump pledged to use the Justice Department to go after his political enemies, which legal experts said could undermine the impartiality of career prosecutors and shatter norms of prosecutorial independence. Williams praised his office's career attorneys as ""patriots"" and said they acted with independence.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-trade-muddles-inflation-outlook-110000054.html,"Mon, Nov 25, 2024, 3:00 AM","(Bloomberg) -- A stock-market rally boosted by President-elect Donald Trump’s victory is set to put upward pressure on the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, which in turn could keep interest rates elevated. Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas NYC's Underground Steam System May Be Key to a Greener Future In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field NYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge Record NYC Thanksgiving Travel Signals Airport, Traffic Mess The post-election surge in stock prices will register as an increase in the cost of portfolio management and investment advice services, a category within the personal consumption expenditures price index that largely follows swings in the market. Moves within that category have a direct impact on Fed policy decisions as they feed into a key metric of broader services inflation that officials watch closely. Services inflation has been a relatively stubborn component of the overall PCE index, which is seen rising 0.2% in October from the prior month and 2.3% from a year ago in data due Wednesday. Skanda Amarnath, executive director of Employ America, estimates stock-market effects account for more than a third of excess core services inflation compared with the pre-pandemic trend. “Either stocks have to correct or the Fed’s going to be in a position where they’re forced to slow down their cuts and be a little hawkish,” Amarnath said. “If the equity market corrects more sharply this month, then a lot of things get a lot easier.” The S&P 500 climbed ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election on bets Trump would win and reached a record high after he did, as investors piled into the so-called Trump trade — betting the president-elect will enact pro-business policies once he returns to the White House in January. Economists have a pretty good idea of what the portfolio management category will show in Wednesday’s data. That’s because PCE uses similar source data as another monthly government report on producer prices, which showed portfolio management fees advanced 3.6% from the prior month in October, the most in six months. The component was introduced in the government’s price analysis in the early 2000s. It is based on changes in the amount of revenue mutual fund and asset managers receive for providing investment advice. The category tends to track the equity market reliably — with a roughly one-month lag — because better-performing stocks mean higher fees for asset managers. The PCE equivalent accounts for roughly 1.5% of the overall basket — not a lot, but enough to move the needle when markets see significant swings. The stock-market momentum “is likely to remain a persistent source of inflation amid expectations of easier business conditions next year under the Trump administration,” Bloomberg economists Eliza Winger and Estelle Ou wrote in a note last week.

The euro zone's biggest economy has been the bloc's laggard in recent years and the outlook is bleak as export demand is lacklustre, its oversized industry is in recession and consumers are proving too cautious, building up savings instead of spending cash buffers. ""Germany is stuck in a period of economic weakness which has now lasted two and a half years,"" Nagel said in a speech. ""Stagnation is likely in the final quarter of this year,"" Nagel said, adding that this would mean negative growth and Germany would be falling behind the rest of the bloc. While weak growth is a drag on consumer prices, Nagel also cautioned against quick ECB rate cuts, arguing that risks remain. Wage growth may still prove too quick, underlying inflation is still high and trade policies of the new U.S. administration could prove inflationary, he warned.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-treasury-pick-wants-shadow-110000517.html,"Sat, Nov 23, 2024, 3:00 AM","(Bloomberg) -- Scott Bessent, the veteran hedge fund manager who Donald Trump picked to become the next Treasury secretary, wants tariffs, a shadow chair for the Federal Reserve and maybe a weaker dollar. Most Read from Bloomberg NYC's Underground Steam System May Be Key to a Greener Future In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field NYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge NYC Mayor Adams Names Jessica Tisch to Lead Police Head Amid Probes Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting If confirmed by the Senate, he will have a sprawling remit: oversee public financing, economic sanctions and the Internal Revenue Service; engage in international economic diplomacy; and help ensure the smooth functioning of financial markets. Bessent, who currently runs macro hedge fund Key Square Group LP, will be crucial to implementing the president-elect’s agenda, which includes renewing some of Trump’s 2017 tax cuts that expire next year and loosening financial regulations. Below is a roundup of what Bessent has said over the past year on policies that will influence the US economy. Listen to the Here’s Why podcast on Apple, Spotify or anywhere you listen. Federal Reserve Trump has said that a president should have some say over interest rates and monetary policy, a move that would undercut the longstanding independence the central bank has enjoyed from the executive branch. Bessent doesn’t seem to disagree with Trump, and even criticized the Fed himself in September after its jumbo rate cut. “If you were concerned about the integrity of the institution, you would not have done it. You especially would have not done a jumbo cut. In reputation, everything is optics ... tell me on what planet is it conceivable that waiting two months is make or break, versus the integrity of the institution.” — Bloomberg News, Oct. 11 Bessent will also have a hand in helping Trump choose a replacement for Fed Chair Jerome Powell when his term expires in May 2026, and at least three other appointments to the board in the next four years. Trump has flirted with the idea of firing Powell before, but Bessent has floated a fresh idea. “You could do the earliest Fed nomination and create a shadow Fed chair. And based on the concept of forward guidance, no one is really going to care what Jerome Powell has to say anymore.” — Barron’s interview, Oct. 9. “If you believe forward guidance is good, why can’t you give forward guidance on who the Fed chair is going to be. You could do one of two things: The current Fed chair could be reappointed, so you’ve created a path there. Or the new Fed chair nominee would give forward guidance beyond the current Fed chair’s sell-by date.” — Bloomberg Radio on Oct. 11. Tariffs Trump has vowed to impose massive new tariffs, eyeing a duty of 10% to 20% on all foreign goods and 60% or higher on goods coming from China. On the campaign trail, he also made threats of even-higher rates on specific countries and products. While Bessent has at times suggested that Trump is signaling a maximalist approach as a negotiation tactic, in an op-ed Nov. 15 for Fox News he signaled strong support for tariffs. “For too long, the conventional wisdom has rejected the use of tariffs as a tool of both economic and foreign policy. However, like Alexander Hamilton, we should not be afraid to use the power of tariffs to improve the livelihoods of American families and businesses.” “Tariffs are also a useful tool for achieving the president’s foreign policy objectives. Whether it is getting allies to spend more on their own defense, opening foreign markets to US exports, securing cooperation on ending illegal immigration and interdicting fentanyl trafficking, or deterring military aggression, tariffs can play a central role.” Markets Treasury secretaries have traditionally refrained from attributing market gains to the work of their bosses since that would mean taking the blame for a downturn — not to mention that the stock, currency and bond markets move for often unrelated, and even inexplicable, reasons. But when markets go up, Trump enjoys a boast. In a Nov. 11 op-ed in the Wall Street Journal under the headline “Markets Hail Trump’s Economics,” Bessent did the job for Trump. “Asset prices are fickle, and long-term economic performance is the ultimate measuring stick. But recent days prove markets’ unambiguous embrace of the Trump 2.0 economic vision. Markets are signaling expectations of higher growth, lower volatility and inflation, and a revitalized economy for all Americans.” “The rally in equities was particularly unusual given that interest rates also moved higher. The combination of the steepening yield curve, stable inflation expectations and the rise in stocks indicates that markets expect the Trump agenda to foster noninflationary growth that will drive private investment.” Dollar Policy It’s no secret that Trump likes the dollar’s role as the world’s reserve asset, and the accompanying economic and geopolitical power. But he also wants a weak enough foreign-exchange rate to buoy the US manufacturing sector. The dueling forces may become a pillar of his administration’s economic agenda, and as Treasury chief, Bessent will oversee US currency policy. “The reserve currency can go up and down based on the market. I believe that if you have good economic polices, you’re naturally going to have a strong dollar.” — Oct. 13 interview in Financial Times “It’s a market reaction and he understands that tariffs cause a stronger dollar, so a weaker dollar with tariffs is an economic abnormality. We could see what’s called the dollar smile. What we have now is high interest rates and high deficit and inflation above target. If you get inflation down ... interest rates could come down, and you would have a market-based dollar depreciation. But in terms of an over-weak dollar policy, I wouldn’t expect that at all.” — Nov. 5 Bloomberg TV interview “Trump’s election drove the largest single-day increase in the US dollar in more than two years, and third largest in the last decade. This is a vote of confidence in US leadership internationally and in the dollar as the world’s reserve currency.” — Nov. 11 op-ed in the Wall Street Journal Debt and Taxes Bessent will also oversee management of the government’s nearly $29 trillion debt pile. He’s said Trump will aim to shrink federal budget deficits to 3% of gross domestic product, from roughly 6.2% at the end of the latest fiscal year. “I think we’re going to do it through deregulation, energy dominance and re-privatizing the economy ... I think a priority is going to be turning off the [Inflation Reduction Act] ... I don’t think anyone is going to have a problem with slowing down or cutting off this IRA.” — Nov. 6 interview with CNBC Issuing ultra long-term bonds “would have been a great idea,” Bessent said in a June 7 Bloomberg interview. “When rates are very low, you should extend duration,” he said. “I think it’s very unfortunate what Secretary Yellen’s doing. She’s financing at the front end, and she’s making a bet on the carry trade, which is not good risk management.” Bessent will also play a key role shepherding the extension of Trump’s signature 2017 tax cuts, many of which are set to expire in 2025. “I’ve already been in conversations with a lot of the Republicans who will chair those committees and I can tell you in the Republican Congress, especially in the House, there’s a big appetite for pay-fors. So it will be a negotiation.” — Nov. 6 CNBC interview --With assistance from Saleha Mohsin.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-pandemic-program-help-main-140007499.html,"Fri, Nov 22, 2024, 6:00 AM","(Bloomberg) -- A Federal Reserve pandemic program aimed at supporting mid-size businesses is now having the opposite effect on some of them, burying them in high interest rates and balloon payments and leading to layoffs at companies struggling to stay afloat. Most Read from Bloomberg Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting NYC Mayor Adams Names Jessica Tisch to Lead Police Head Amid Probes Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll The central bank designed the Main Street Lending Program to help businesses that were generally too big to apply for forgivable loans through the Paycheck Protection Program and too small to tap US capital markets. The program, which marked the Fed’s first effort to systematically support American businesses in such a way since the Great Depression, ultimately made 1,830 adjustable-rate loans ranging in size from $100,000 to $300 million. While much of the $17.5 billion in loans has been repaid, $1.23 billion in interest and principal payments was in default as of Oct. 31. The government watchdog charged with overseeing the program expects defaults to grow dramatically as businesses contend with two major challenges: a massive 70% lump sum payment due next year and a steep interest bill. “There’s been this double whammy,” said Justin Paget, an attorney and partner at Hunton Andrews Kurth LLP, which has represented lenders and borrowers on about 10% of the program’s loans. Policymakers made the rates on the loans adjustable, a feature that became crippling for borrowers when the Fed began to rapidly raise rates two years later to quell inflation. “A lot of the businesses felt that they would have a bigger bounce back in cash flow and profitability coming out of Covid,” he said. “For many of them, those forecasts just haven’t come to fruition.” Main Street was one of the many programs launched in 2020, backed by funds from the $2.2 trillion CARES Act and approved by the US Treasury. Lawmakers rushed to shore up the economy with the largest stimulus package in US history, but had no way of foreseeing the ultimate path of the pandemic or the surge in inflation that would follow. The challenges of implementing the brand-new program and the burden it has become for many of its borrowers raises questions about whether it’ll remain in the Fed’s crisis toolbox. “I’d be very surprised if they did this type of program again,” said Eric Rosengren, former president of the Boston Fed, which runs Main Street. Main Street is the central bank’s only emergency lending effort to experience actual credit losses — losses that could have been much larger if the program had reached its $600 billion lending cap. The Fed still expects to be made whole over the lifetime of the program, however, with interest payments covering some losses and an up to $75 billion Treasury backstop absorbing the rest. “The Main Street Lending Program worked with banks to provide much needed loans to small and medium-sized businesses and nonprofits that were in sound financial condition before the pandemic, but that were hurt by the sudden reduction in economic activity through no fault of their own,” a Fed spokesperson said. “The program, along with other efforts, helped keep workers employed and businesses afloat during a very difficult and uncertain time.” Tough Terms Banks underwrote the loans but the Fed assumed the majority of the risk, as lenders were only required to retain 5% of the balance on their books. By design, the program was meant for companies in need of funding but deemed too risky to qualify for a traditional loan. “Many people in Congress were hearing from mid-sized businesses saying a lot of employment is going to be lost if we end up closing,” Rosengren said. “There was a risk that many of these firms that employ substantially more than a small firm would possibly not make it to the other side.” While the lending terms were onerous, Main Street offered the only survival option for some companies. The payment schedule — which required no payments on interest or principal in the first year — is now snowballing. Interest rates have risen in a way unimaginable four years ago, following a decade of both low inflation and borrowing costs. Those supersized interest payments, Paget said, have thwarted businesses’ ability to invest in their own firms. Tejune Kang’s marketing company, Atypical Digital, faithfully made interest payments on its $3.5 million loan, even as they surged from $11,000 a month to $25,000. But he couldn’t keep up when the first balloon payment came due last year. Though Kang was able to get a six-month extension, the $65,000 combined monthly interest and principal bill was still too much. “It feels like — did I take money from the devil? What did I sign up for?” Kang said. “It’s a tough situation.” The Fed has allowed some businesses to extend their loans, but not past 2026. Atypical Digital, which works with companies including Adobe Inc. and Toyota Motor Corp. on everything from web optimization to software customization, saw large contracts dry up during the pandemic. It turned to smaller companies to fill the gap, but the contracts brought in less money. To help make the payments, Kang has laid off about 60% of his staff. While the Main Street loans didn’t have a specific employment mandate like the PPP did, the Fed told companies to make “commercially reasonable” efforts to retain employees while loans were outstanding. Main Street Lending Program Basics Backstopped through the CARES Act and the Fed started purchasing loans in July 2020 Available to companies with $5 billion or less in revenue or up to 15,000 employees Minimum loan size: $100,000 Operated through five facilities, including two for nonprofits The program made a lot of sense for businesses that were particularly affected by the pandemic, like those in the service sector, which made up a majority of the loans. Smaller cruise companies, gyms and entertainment venues comprised many of the borrowers. Even so, take-up was low. In total, the $17.5 billion of loans represented just 3% of the program’s $600 billion cap. Low usage along with the burdensome loan terms have led critics to argue Main Street should have been a direct help program, more similar to the PPP, rather than loans that have to be paid back. At the time, however, there was little appetite to add to the pandemic bill. Bharat Ramamurti, who headed a Congressional commission charged with overseeing the Fed’s pandemic programs, said some defaults in a program like this are inevitable. “If there weren’t any, I would argue that it meant that the facility wasn’t doing a good job because it was being far too restrictive in terms of what types of companies were getting support,” he added. But Brian Miller, the Special Inspector General for Pandemic Recovery, expects many more companies to default over the next year. “The defaults are going through the roof and will continue to do so,” he said. Some of those defaults include borrowers who never intended to use the money for their businesses, Miller said. As a result, defaults can also be used as a warning signal for law enforcement to find and punish fraud, which permeated several pandemic-era programs. More than 70% of Miller and his staff's investigations into Main Street loans involve a default, a spokesperson for SIGPR said. That was the case in the investigation of a $424,168 Main Street loan, borrowed by an Oklahoma woman ostensibly to cover payroll and expenses for her children’s clothing company, according to the government watchdog. Instead, she used the funds to build a house and buy a luxury car before defaulting on the loan. She pleaded guilty to bank fraud and money laundering charges, and was sentenced to 20 months in federal prison in November 2023. Post-Pandemic World For some Main Street borrowers, the realities of the post-pandemic economy — unforeseen in 2020 — are making paying back the debt impossible. World of Beer, a restaurant and bar chain specializing in craft brews, used part of its $8 million Main Street loan to open a new location in the lobby of an office building in Arlington, Virginia. It was banking on a steady stream of after-work clients that never materialized in a sluggish return-to-office environment. World of Beer filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, following other casual dining establishments this year, and has shuttered all three of the locations it opened with the Main Street money, said Steven Berman, an attorney and partner at the law firm Shumaker, Loop & Kendrick, LLP, which is representing World of Beer in its bankruptcy case. “People misjudged how dramatically Covid would affect the way people move around in town, the way people do businesses, where they go, how they spend their money,” Berman said. “And then you add to that inflation, increased interest rates and an increase in cost of goods needed to run a food and beverage company and you sort of have a perfect storm of economic negatives that have affected a lot of businesses in the country.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Clear’s Dominance in Airports Could Be Coming to an End An Airline’s Florida Resort Dreams Look More Like a Nightmare Jaylen Brown Is Taking On Nike With $200 Sneakers Why ‘Premiumization’ Has Made Flying So Much Better—and Worse What Happens When US Hospitals Go Big on Nurse Practitioners ©2024 Bloomberg L.P.","Federal Reserve pandemic program aimed at supporting mid-size businesses is now opposite effect on some them, burying them high interest rates and balloon payments and leading to layoffs at companies struggling to stay afloat.

In an analysis in Foreign Policy magazine earlier this month, Marc R. DeVore, a senior lecturer at the University of St. Andrews’s School of International Relations, and Alexander Mertens, a professor of finance at the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, explained how Russia can’t produce enough to replace what it’s losing on the battlefield. For example, the military is losing about 320 tank and artillery cannon barrels a month, while Russian factories can only produce 20 each month, forcing the Kremlin to dig into aging Soviet stockpiles. But that’s not enough, and Russia will run out of barrels sometime in 2025, DeVore and Mertens estimated. In addition, Russia is losing about 155 infantry fighting vehicles a month, but its defense industry can only make 17 a month. The supply-and-demand economics of artillery shells and troops are also unsustainable. ""Russia cannot continue waging the current war beyond late 2025, when it will begin running out of key weapons systems,"" they wrote. But the Kremlin's mobilization of the economy to support the war has also left it vulnerable to an eventual end to hostilities. DeVore and Mertens noted that paring back massive defense spending will trigger an economic downturn and leave many without work. ""The experience of other societies—in particular, European states after World War I—suggests that hordes of demobilized soldiers and jobless defense workers are a recipe for political instability,"" they warned. The war has also distorted the composition of Russia's economy, favoring defense firms at the expense of small- and medium-sized firms that serve the civilian sector, which won't be able to absorb soldiers and workers displaced by the war's end. A peace deal would leave Putin with three unpalatable options, according to DeVore and Mertens. The first would be to shrink the military and defense industry, sparking a recession that threatens the regime. The second is to maintain a massive military that eventually chokes off economic growth. ""Having experienced the Soviet Union’s decline and fall for similar economic reasons, Russian leaders will probably seek to avoid this fate,"" they added. The third option is to maintain the military and use it to seize the resources it needs—""in other words, using conquest and the threat thereof to pay for the military."" They pointed to offshore gas reserves in the Black Sea, other natural resources in Ukraine, or the withdrawal of Western sanctions as possibilities. ""Russia's supersized military sector incentivizes the Kremlin to use its military to extract rents from neighboring states,"" DeVore and Mertens said. ""The alternatives—demobilizing and incurring a recession or indefinitely funding a bloated military and defense industry—pose existential threats to Putin's regime."" Peace, in some form, could come sooner rather than later as President-elect Donald Trump has signaled he is eager to find a way to stop the fighting.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/economists-see-stubborn-inflation-gradual-140000258.html,"Fri, Nov 22, 2024, 6:00 AM","(Bloomberg) -- Economists see the Federal Reserve taking a more measured approach to interest-rate cuts next year amid stubborn inflation and limited prospects that price pressures can cool much under President-elect Donald Trump. Most Read from Bloomberg Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting NYC Mayor Adams Names Jessica Tisch to Lead Police Head Amid Probes Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll The Fed’s preferred inflation gauges will run a touch faster in the coming year than expected last month, according to the latest Bloomberg monthly survey of economists. They project the so-called core personal consumption expenditures price index — which excludes the volatile food and energy categories — to advance 2.3% on average next year. That’s up from the 2.2% projection in last month’s survey. Economists also adjusted their fourth-quarter 2024 projections higher in the wake of firmer inflation readings more recently, helping explain a more patient Fed. While forecasters still largely expect central bankers to lower rates next month for a third straight meeting, they anticipate policymakers will hold borrowing costs steady in January. For all of 2025, economists now see a 3.25% to 3.5% range for the federal funds rate, indicating one less rate cut than they projected a month ago. Investors and economists have generally pared back expectations for how low rates will fall. Fed officials have also indicated they’re in no rush to keep cutting rates after every policy meeting as long the labor market remains resilient and the economy continues to power ahead. Though Trump’s agenda may be good for business, some of his proposed policies — including higher tariffs and demand-spurring tax cuts — risk rekindling inflation. The president-elect’s proposals includes tariffs of as much as 20% on all imports and 60% on Chinese goods, as well as mass deportation of undocumented migrants. “We have only made a moderate upward adjustment to our inflation forecast for 2025 to account for an additional 30% increase in tariffs being levied against China,” said Kathy Bostjancic, chief economist at Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. “We feel it is premature to assume any other changes to tariff and immigration policies and we will need to wait to see what the new administration proposes and is eventually enacted.” Bloomberg’s latest survey of 83 economists Nov. 15-20 also showed upward adjustments for growth in imports through the first quarter of next year, highlighting a rush by companies to stock up prior to any increase in tariffs. Stronger Growth Economists also marked up their 2025 economic growth projections. Forecasters see gross domestic product averaging 2% in 2025, up from last month’s 1.8% forecast. That reflects stronger expectations for consumer spending, which they revised up through mid-2025. The prospect of a smooth political transition and a lower tax environment means that companies that delayed investment and hiring plans may now be prepared to “start putting money to work,” said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING. “This improved clarity has led us to modestly revise higher our growth forecasts for the first half of 2025.” Economists see a 25% chance of recession in the next year, unchanged from last month and the lowest reading since March 2022. They also expect payrolls growth to average 126,000 in 2025 after an anticipated 172,000 this year.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/iran-braces-trump-reset-economy-060000602.html,"Sat, Nov 23, 2024, 10:00 PM","(Bloomberg) -- When Donald Trump first entered the White House in 2017, Cyrus Razzaghi was running an Iranian business consultancy, advising US, Japanese and European companies about how to grab opportunities in a market emerging from years of economic isolation. Most Read from Bloomberg NYC's Underground Steam System May Be Key to a Greener Future In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field NYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge NYC Mayor Adams Names Jessica Tisch to Lead Police Head Amid Probes Record NYC Thanksgiving Travel Signals Airport, Traffic Mess That all changed the following year, when the then-US President abandoned Iran’s landmark nuclear deal with world powers and imposed severe economic sanctions instead. “We had to diversify away from Iran and somehow hedge ourselves for further animosity,” Razzaghi, chairman of Ara Enterprise Consultancy Group, said by phone from Tehran. “At one point we thought there was going to be a war.” As Trump prepares for a second term as US president, all eyes are on whether he will revive his so-called maximum pressure policy against Iran that came to mark his first spell. But with Iranians struggling with economic hardship after years of sanctions, its leaders are signaling they’re keen to establish a different relationship this time around. On Tuesday, the United Nations nuclear watchdog said Iran had agreed to stop producing uranium enriched to levels near those required for making bombs — an unprecedented move seen by some as an olive branch to Trump. New Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, a straight-talking reformist, has prioritized sanctions relief, rapprochement with the West and economic “normality” for Iranians since his surprise election win in July. “We are very worried and concerned about Trump’s return, though I wouldn’t rule out a deal with Trump either,” Razzaghi said. Oil Trade A hardline approach by Trump could significantly impact Iran’s oil trade, with the President-Elect having squeezed flows from the Islamic Republic during his first term that ended in 2021. “On top of the sanction list will be Iranian crude oil exports,” said John Evans, an analyst at brokers PVM Oil Associates Ltd. in London. “The playbook will be similar to the one experienced during the first Trump presidency.” Like other producers, Tehran is contending with a 15% slide in crude prices since late June and the prospect that an impending global glut will trigger a further slump next year. Iranian oil output has recovered considerably in recent years, as refiners in China — Tehran’s biggest customer — snap up cut-price barrels and the Biden administration eases enforcement of sanctions to rein in gasoline costs. It’s unclear if the recovery could prove resilient against another Trump term, even with the formidable logistical network the Islamic Republic has built up to circumvent sanctions. Economic Hardship In Iran, Pezeshkian faces myriad economic challenges, including inflation of more than 30%, fuel shortages, high capital outflows and the loss of skilled and educated workers through migration to Europe and the US. The rial has tanked to successive record lows against the dollar and has so far lost more than 90% of its value since May 2018. “Reducing tension with the US is essential for Iran’s economic stability,” said Maciej Wojtal, chief investment officer at Amtelon Capital. “The new government has sent clear messages, indicating a willingness to negotiate – a shift from its usual strategy of escalating uranium enrichment as leverage.” Wojtal said. Wrangling over Iran’s atomic activities remains a factor however, with Tehran saying Friday it will increase the number of centrifuges in its nuclear program in response to a censure by the United Nations’ watchdog — even as it commits to stop producing weapon-ready uranium. Blackouts, Protests The lack of critical investment needed for Iranian infrastructure has forced Tehran to increase imports of high-quality gasoline as its own refineries struggle to keep up, while introducing rolling electricity blackouts as power stations struggle to supply homes and industry. All of this points to even higher inflation, which Pezeshkian can ill afford at a time of regional conflict and instability — abroad and at home. Iran was hit by deadly protests in 2019, triggered by a rise in gasoline prices, and a national uprising three years later, the biggest popular rebuke against Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the country’s system of religious rule since 1979. “Pezeshkian’s job is to bring about national reconciliation and he’s been somewhat successful,” said Vali Nasr, a former senior advisor to the US State Department and a professor at Johns Hopkins University. Pragmatic Team Pezeshkian has appointed a foreign-policy team led by Abbas Araghchi that not only negotiated the original nuclear agreement in 2015 but had to deal with the chaos unleashed after Trump walked away. Their presence “shows the Iranians are definitely interested in a deal with the US,” Nasr said. “They are pragmatic enough to know that if they find a way forward, it’s much better to deal with someone who can get a deal done.” It’s unclear how Trump’s new government will respond to Iranian pragmatism. His cabinet nominations so far include staunch allies of Israel — which which the Islamic Republic has exchanged direct fire twice this year — and people who have advocated bombing Iran. Iran’s challenge is that it “needs a direct channel to Trump to overcome the resistance of the anti-Iranian regime ecosystem that Trump is wrapped into,” said Ali Vaez, director of the Iran Project at the Washington-based International Crisis Group. One factor that could work in Iran’s favor is the changed geopolitical landscape facing Trump in the Middle East. During his first term, he was able to rely on support from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, who both fully embraced his maximum-pressure strategy and tighter sanctions on Iran. But the relationship between Riyadh and Tehran has improved significantly since then, with their mutual opposition to the civilian deathtoll of Israel’s wars against Iranian proxy groups in Gaza and Lebanon drawing them closer together. Both countries refreshed a bilateral agreement brokered by China at a meeting in the Saudi capital on Nov. 20. For businessman Cyrus Razzaghi, there’s nothing new about the uncertainty. He’s advising clients that a fresh round of maximum pressure is likelier than a deal, but they should always keep an open mind. “Back in 2016, there was a lot of wishful thinking in Tehran that this guy is a businessman, he could give us a really good deal. Soon the reality hit everybody,” Razzaghi said. “But one must be hopeful there’s still a chance for some kind of a deal because Iran has also learned from the past.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek What Happens When US Hospitals Go Big on Nurse Practitioners Why the Flying Experience Feels So Much Worse Clear’s Dominance in Airports Could Be Coming to an End An Airline’s Florida Resort Dreams Look More Like a Nightmare Don’t Get Out of the Points Game, Says the Points Guy ©2024 Bloomberg L.P.","(Bloomberg) -- Donald Trump entered the in 2017, Cyrus Razzaghi running an business consultancy, advising Japanese and European companies about how to grab opportunities in market emerging from years of economic Most Read Underground May Be Key to a Greener Future In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium for Women’s Takes the NYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes Pledge NYC Mayor Adams Names Jessica Tisch Lead Police Head Probes NYC Airport, Mess That changed following year, then-US President abandoned landmark nuclear deal world powers severe economic sanctions had to diversify somehow hedge for animosity,” Razzaghi, chairman of Ara Enterprise Group, said by phone Tehran. “At point thought there was to Trump for a second term as US president, all eyes are on whether he will revive so-called maximum pressure policy against Iran that came to mark his first spell. with Iranians struggling economic hardship years of sanctions, leaders are they’re keen to establish a different relationship this time around.

The report is also expected to reveal resilient household spending and steady income growth at the start of the fourth quarter. Consumer outlays, unadjusted for price changes, are forecast to climb 0.4% after a 0.5% advance the previous month. Personal income is seen rising 0.3% for a second month, buoyed by healthy yet moderating job growth. While Fed policymakers will receive another set of inflation data — the November consumer and producer price indexes — before their Dec. 17-18 meeting, they won’t see another PCE price gauge as they debate whether to lower rates. What Bloomberg Economics Says: “Several Fed officials discussing US economic conditions of late have echoed a theme recently introduced by Chair Jerome Powell — a December rate cut isn’t a done deal and the central bank can slow its easing pace given subsiding risks to the economy.” — Anna Wong, Stuart Paul, Eliza Winger, Estelle Ou and Chris G. Collins. For full analysis, click here The income and spending report packs the biggest punch for investors during a Wednesday data barrage ahead of the Thanksgiving Day holiday. The government that day will also release revised third-quarter gross domestic product, durable goods orders, jobless claims and merchandise trade deficit figures. On Tuesday, investors will parse minutes of the Fed’s early-November meeting for hints of policymakers’ appetite for a third straight rate cut next month. As of Friday, market participants assigned slightly better than even odds for another quarter-point reduction. For more, read Bloomberg Economics’ full Week Ahead for the US Turning north, Canada’s third-quarter gross domestic product on Friday may help officials decide between a second 50 basis-point rate cut or a more cautious 25 basis-point move in December. Output data pointed to 1% growth, but economists expect the expenditure-based figures to land closer to a central bank estimate of 1.5% annualized expansion, supporting the case for more gradual reductions. Elsewhere, Chinese survey numbers, a likely pickup in euro-area inflation, and monetary decisions — including a possible large rate cut in New Zealand — are among the highlights. Click here for what happened in the past week, and below is our wrap of what’s coming up in the global economy. Asia China’s economic health will stay in the spotlight, with purchasing managers’ indexes set for release at the end of the week. Policymakers and economists will look for further signs that Beijing’s recent stimulus is gaining early traction. Last month, both the factory and service sector PMIs showed resilient or expanding activity for the first time since April. New Zealand’s central bank may consider a jumbo rate cut on Wednesday. The reduction is likely to be a half-percentage point rather than anything bigger as the Reserve Bank looks to balance caution over lingering inflation with the need to restart a stalled economy. The Bank of Korea is expected to stand pat on Thursday as it monitors the impact of its pivot toward lower rates in October. Reserve Bank of Australia chief Michele Bullock’s views on the policy outlook will be under the microscope when she speaks at an event a day after the latest monthly inflation figures are released. Elsewhere, rate decisions are also due in Sri Lanka and Kazakhstan. New Zealand, Hong Kong and Thailand will release trade figures in the coming week, Singapore has inflation numbers, and Japan will report on factory production, retail sales and the latest price growth data from Tokyo. For more, read Bloomberg Economics’ full Week Ahead for Asia Europe, Middle East, Africa Inflation will take center stage in the euro zone, where data releases will start on Thursday before a report for the region as a whole the following day. Price growth is predicted by forecasters to have quickened in all four of the largest economies. Inflation in the euro area probably accelerated to 2.3% in November, the fastest reading for four months. Investors will also watch for the European Central Bank’s survey of consumer-price expectations on Friday. Several appearances are scheduled over the course of the week by policymakers, including Chief Economist Philip Lane. ECB officials have become increasingly sanguine on inflation prospects and will probably view the anticipated re-acceleration as a short-lived blip. “Prices are increasing less quickly than wages on average — this also allows us to lower interest rates,” Governing Council member Francois Villeroy de Galhau told Ouest-France newspaper in an interview published late Saturday. Germany’s Ifo index of business expectations on Monday — the first since Donald Trump’s re-election raised the prospect of new tariffs — will also be a highlight. In the UK, the Bank of England is likely to draw attention. Governor Andrew Bailey will address business leaders on Monday, and the latest financial stability report will be published at the end of the week. Turning to Sweden, data on Friday may show the economy succumbed to a recession in the third quarter. Before that, two Riksbank officials are scheduled to speak. For more, read Bloomberg Economics’ full Week Ahead for EMEA Several monetary decisions are scheduled in the wider region: On Monday, Israel’s central bank is likely to hold its base rate at 4.5% at a time when wars in Gaza and Lebanon are causing price pressures and slowing the economy. On Tuesday, Nigerian officials may hike borrowing costs to cool price growth stoked by gasoline, currency weakness and floods. Governor Olayemi Cardoso has said the central bank wants a positive inflation-adjusted interest rate to attract investment and support the naira. The spread between inflation and the benchmark is now about 660 basis points. Lesotho, whose currency is pegged to the rand and is experiencing slowing price growth, is expected to follow South Africa and cut by a quarter point. In Mozambique on Wednesday, policymakers may keep their rate at 13.5%, concerned by the impact election unrest may have on inflation. A day later, Gambian officials, encouraged by weakening price growth, may cut benchmark borrowing costs, currently set at 17%. On Friday, Ghana is expected to leave its benchmark at 27% because of concerns about missing its year-end target for inflation at 18%. Latin America In Mexico, the central bank’s quarterly inflation report and minutes of Banxico’s Nov. 14 decision to deliver a third straight rate reduction to 10.25% are keenly awaited. Analysts have been trimming their 2024 and 2025 GDP forecasts while Banxico notably raised its fourth-quarter inflation projection to 4.7% from 4.3% at its November meeting. Governor Victoria Rodríguez on Nov. 19 indicated that, given the progress in slowing consumer-price increases, more easing lies ahead. Jobs data for October are also on tap in three of the region’s big economies. Brazil’s national unemployment may eclipse the previous low of 6.3% to set a new mark. In Colombia, the early consensus has the urban jobless rate falling to 8.9%, well below the average for the series. Chile’s current unemployment level of 8.7% points to the slack in the labor market and economy. In addition to the jobs report, Chile also posts October retail sales, commercial activity, industrial production, manufacturing production and total copper output. Budget figures and the Brazilian central bank’s weekly readout of market expectations bookend the mid-month inflation report, which is likely to show consumer prices taking another leg up, both above target and the top of its tolerance range. Local economists have raised their year-end forecasts in 26 of the central bank’s last 28 weekly surveys.

Spot gold was down 1.8% at $2,664.53 per ounce, as of 0619 GMT, after declining more than 2% earlier in the session.  Gold's five-session rally has paused due to some profit-taking and Donald Trump's pick of Bessent as the next U.S. Treasury secretary, hinting at tempered use of tariffs and easing U.S.-China trade uncertainty, said IG market strategist Yeap Jun Rong. Shares climbed in Europe and Asia on Monday, tracking last week’s gains on Wall Street, and analysts said investors were viewing President-elect Donald Trump’s choice of billionaire investor Scott Bessent as his nominee for Treasury secretary as a relatively market-friendly choice.  In Asian trading, Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index gained 1.3% to 38,780.14 while the Kospi in Seoul rose 1.3% to 2,534.34.

The Russia-Ukraine conflict has rapidly intensified following months of bloody attrition, with the use of longer-range missiles by both sides this week. At the same time, Iran said it will increase its nuclear fuel-making capacity after it was censured by the UN’s International Atomic Energy Agency. A gain in equity markets also gave crude a boost, though the rally was capped by a stronger dollar that makes commodities priced in the currency less attractive. Euro-area business activity unexpectedly shrank, a sign of the risks from heightened discord over trade. Still, bullish signs for crude emerged this week. WTI’s nearest timespread strengthened to 48 cents — indicating tighter supplies — after briefly flipping into a bearish contango structure earlier this week for the first time since February. Oil has swung between weekly gains and losses since mid-October, with a strong dollar, ample supply and indications of weak demand providing headwinds. At the same time, geopolitical tensions — including the Kremlin’s revamp of its nuclear doctrine this week — have caused temporary gains but failed to provide an extended uplift in the face of widespread expectations of a crude surplus next year. “The market is still complacent about geopolitical disruption risk,” Bob McNally, president of Rapidan Energy Group, said in a Bloomberg Television interview. “President Trump will be willing to crimp Russian energy exports to get leverage for deals he wants to cut.” The US, meanwhile, sanctioned Russia’s Gazprombank, closing a loophole that Washington kept open over the course of the war because the lender is key for energy markets. The penalties increase the risk of a cut-off of some of the remaining Russian gas flows to a handful of central European nations.

Most Read from Bloomberg New York City’s ‘Living Breakwaters’ Brace for Stormier Seas In Kansas City, a First-Ever Stadium Designed for Women’s Sports Takes the Field NYC's Underground Steam System May Be Key to a Greener Future NYC Gets Historic Push for 80,000 Homes With $5 Billion Pledge “We believe that the Fed should put easing on hold, barring weak payrolls data in December,” strategists Jabaz Mathai and Alejandra Vazquez said in a Nov. 22 report, referring to the US employment report for November slated to be released on Dec. 6. And even if job creation is weak, “it can be argued that other labor market data such as jobless claims are indicating a resilient labor market.” The strategists recommended that investors position for a pause by the Fed next month by paying the rate on the overnight index swap contract corresponding to the Fed’s December rate decision. They first endorsed the trade on Nov. 5 when the rate was 4.404%, and it has since climbed to about 4.46%, at which level it prices in just under 50% odds of a quarter-point rate cut. The caveat, they wrote: “This is a dovish Fed and the threshold to skip is high.” Meanwhile, Citi economists are holding out for a half-point Fed rate cut in December — while acknowledging that the odds have faded. While soft November jobs data would allow the Fed to cut rates by a half-point, if the US unemployment rates holds steady at 4.1% rather than rising, a quarter-point cut is likelier, the economists Andrew Hollenhorst and Veronica Clark said in reports this month. The Fed cut interest rates by a half point on Sept. 18 at a point when Wall Street was divided on whether policymakers would opt for a quarter-point move instead for their first reduction in years. By the time they followed it up with a quarter-point move on Nov. 7 amid signs of economic resilience, economists at Bank of America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. had scrapped calls for another half-point cut this year. Bond investors more broadly have pared wagers on how much Fed easing can be expected over the next year. In addition to strong performance by the US economy and stock market, the Nov. 5 presidential election of Donald Trump stoked wagers that inflation could re-accelerate. OIS contracts linked to next year’s Fed meetings are priced for about 73 basis points of cuts over the next 12 months to a level of about 3.86%. As recently as early October the expected rate was under 3%. Citi’s economists expect the November jobs report to show job creation short of 150,000, compared with a median forecast of 220,000 in Bloomberg’s survey. For the Fed to pause in December would require job growth of at least 300,000 and an increase in November core consumer prices of at least 0.35%, they said.

The Fed’s 2% inflation goal will not be a focus of review, the Fed said in a statement. “We are open to new ideas and critical feedback and will take on board lessons from the last five years and adapt our approach where appropriate to best serve the American people, to whom we are accountable,” Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in the statement. Discussions among policymakers will begin with the Jan. 28-29, 2025 Fed meeting. The central bank will also continue to host “Fed Listens” events, community outreach meant to incorporate a diversity of voices into officials’ thinking. The Board of Governors will host a research conference focused on the framework review May 15-16 that will include speakers and panelists from outside the central bank.

The report includes a survey of the Fed’s financial-market contacts conducted from late August to late October by New York Fed staff members. It also includes the central bank’s assessment of developing risks in four main areas, including asset valuations, borrowing by businesses and households, leverage in the financial sector and funding risks. More than half the respondents — 54% — cited fiscal debt sustainability as a salient risk, up from 40% just a half year ago. More debt issuance by the Treasury could start to crowd out private investment or limit policy responses if there’s an economic slump, the survey found. The banking sector remained “sound and resilient overall,” with capital ratios hovering around record levels and high liquidity, the Fed said. But in financial markets, the Fed found valuations remain elevated, liquidity “generally low” and leverage across hedge funds at or near the highest level observed since data became available in 2013. The central bank also singled out life insurers for a steady decline in the liquidity of their assets amid greater use of alternative investments. Taking a look at households, the Fed said credit card and auto loan delinquencies were above average, especially among those with lower credit scores. Overall, they judged vulnerabilities related to household and business debt as “moderate.” “These borrowers hold a relatively small share of aggregate debt, and their high delinquency rates reportedly reflect, in part, more borrowing by some households during and after the pandemic, rather than an abrupt broad-based weakening in households’ ability to repay,” the report said. Stablecoin Status The central bank said funding risks have eased but remain “notable.” The report flagged that stablecoin assets “grew substantially” since the prior report and had a total market capitalization of more than $170 billion by the beginning of November — a notch below a record high seen in April 2022. “These digital assets are structurally vulnerable to runs and lack a comprehensive federal prudential regulatory framework,” the Fed said. The new report arrives shortly after the US presidential election, which has already had a big impact on most corners of US financial markets as investors expect less regulation and possibly bigger deficits from the incoming administration. Bitcoin, following an embrace by President-elect Donald Trump, skyrocketed to near $100,000 a token. The S&P 500 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 have been hitting new records, while Treasuries have been selling off as a resilient economy prompted investors to pare expectations of aggressive interest-rate cuts by the Fed. With an eye on last year’s bank failures, the Fed said that most lenders were relying less on uninsured deposits. Those tend to attract customers who might quickly yank their money away if there’s a hint of trouble at a lender, a vulnerability that contributed to bank failures in the weeks surrounding the March 2023 turmoil. Some lenders have now increased deposits collected through brokers and from other short-term sources of cash, according to the report. “The stability of this type of funding during periods of stress may be lower than that of traditional core insured deposits,” the Fed said. --With assistance from Vildana Hajric and Ye Xie.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-thinking-former-fed-governor-181153787.html,"Fri, Nov 22, 2024, 1:20 PM","President-elect Donald Trump could be considering a former member of the board of governors of the Federal Reserve to be his Treasury secretary, and eventually Fed chair once Jerome Powell’s term ends. It so happens to be Kevin Warsh, according to the Wall Street Journal, which cited people familiar with the matter. Warsh and Trump reportedly discussed the two-step process on Wednesday in Mar-a-Lago; it is the center of the political universe, after all. Warsh may be a front-runner for Treasury secretary, per the Journal, but Trump is still undecided. Plus, Trump apparently is still debating how he’ll handle the Fed vacancy; he might even wait until it gets closer to the day Powell is set to leave. “President-elect Trump is making decisions on who will serve in his second administration. Those decisions will continue to be announced by him when they are made,” Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for the Trump-Vance transition team, said in a statement. Warsh did not immediately respond to Fortune’s attempt to reach him. Earlier, Trump seemed to be choosing between Howard Lutnick, the chairman and chief executive of Cantor Fitzgerald, who had the backing of the world’s richest man Elon Musk; and Scott Bessent. That was before Lutnick was nominated for Secretary of Commerce. As for Bessent, the founder and chief executive of Key Square Group, he’s being floated to lead the National Economic Council, before eventually being nominated as Treasury secretary—if Warsh actually becomes Fed chair, some sources told the Journal. Sort of confusing, right? Let’s not forget that Marc Rowan, chief executive of Apollo Global Management, is in the mix, too. Obviously, no one but Trump knows who’ll be his Treasury secretary, let alone his Fed chair. Even so, what do we know about Kevin Warsh? Well, he was a Fed governor from 2006 to 2011; he studied public policy at Stanford University before attending Harvard Law School; he was an executive at Morgan Stanley; and he was a part of President George W. Bush’s administration. It appears Warsh is currently a lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. Apparently, Warsh was in the running to be Fed chair for Trump’s first term before he picked Powell, whom Trump appears to no longer be a fan of, and wanted to oust at a prior point in time. The Journal reported that Trump asked Warsh on Wednesday about his earlier stance on tariffs, citing one person familiar. Six years ago, during Trump’s first administration, Warsh wrote an op-ed in the Journal that read: “Mr. Trump’s mercantilist rhetoric may prove more than a negotiating tactic, auguring new tariffs and trade restrictions the world over. Economic isolationism would do great harm to our economic growth prospects.” It doesn’t seem to have taken him out of the running; JD Vance ended up being Trump’s running mate despite things the senator said about him in a former life. Not to mention, Warsh already has a prominent supporter in the world of economics. The president of Queens’ College, Cambridge, Mohamed El-Erian, told Bloomberg TV on Friday that Warsh would bring a good understanding and knowledge of economics, policy-making experience, and private-sector experience. He’d do “a really good job,” El-Erian said. Trump has made a lot of nominations for his Cabinet, but this is a big one. We’ll see who he picks, and until he does so, everyone is still in the running.

The print was under the 4.83% reading in the previous two-week period. In separate economic reports Friday, the statistics agency revised year-on-year third-quarter output to 1.6%, up from the 1.5% print in the third-quarter flash reading reported Oct. 30. Underscoring the loss of momentum at the end of the third quarter, GDP-proxy data for September fell to 0.29% from the same month a year earlier, below the 0.45% median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The closely-watched core inflation metric, which excludes volatile items such as food and fuel, slowed to 3.58% from 3.74% in the prior reading, below 3.71% median estimate. The central bank targets inflation at 3%, plus or minus one percentage point. When the preliminary data was released, growth data in the third quarter had been slightly better than economists had predicted. “The good inflation print increases the chance that Banxico cuts 50bp in December,” wrote Kimberley Sperrfechter, emerging markets economist at Capital Economics, in a note. “Our base case remains a 25bp cut given the strong economic activity print in 3Q and upside pressure to US interest rates.” The end of summer price adjustments turned electricity into the top item that contributed to inflation in this two-week period. The continued deceleration in services prices could also be an important factor for the central bank. Mexico’s central bank, known as Banxico, in voting to cut its key interest rate for a third straight meeting last month, signaled a deepening concern over growth even as annual inflation has remained above target in the face of double-digit borrowing costs. An overall slowdown in Latin America’s second-biggest economy has analysts and investors pricing in additional cuts, but they are divided on how low policymakers are willing to go. Banxico board members, led by Governor Victoria Rodriguez in their last meeting noted the sustained slowing of the core component, even though the balance of risks for the trajectory of inflation remained biased to the upside. They listed volatility in financial markets as one of the main global risks. “All in all, we continue to believe Banxico will be able to increase the pace of cuts to 50bp as soon as at its next meeting in December, and take the reference rate down towards 7.50% before year-end 2025,” said Gabriel Casillas, chief of Latin America economics at Barclays Plc. The central bank would likely proceed gradually but could accelerate the pace of easing if the Mexican peso stops depreciating against the US dollar, wrote Alberto Ramos, chief Latin America economist at Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC, in a note.

""Concerns over U.S. fiscal debt sustainability was the top-cited risk. It was noted that increased Treasury issuance could begin to crowd out private investment or constrain policy responses in an economic downturn,"" the U.S. central bank survey found, while a potential weakening of the economy and possibility of a global trade war moved higher on the list of worries. These concerns have also been reflected in recent bond market behavior, with yields on 10-year Treasury notes, for instance, rising sharply over the last two months despite the Fed having cut its benchmark lending rate twice by a total of 75 basis points. Alongside that, an estimate of Treasury term premium - a measure of the compensation that investors require to hold longer-term Treasury securities rather than shorter-term ones - was near the top of its range since 2010. Moreover, measures of interest rate volatility were above historic norms, in part due to ""high uncertainty about the economic outlook and the associated path of monetary policy as well as heightened sensitivity to news about output growth, inflation, and the supply of Treasury securities."" Meanwhile a potential weakening in the economy and the possibility of a global trade war moved higher on the list of worries. ""Risks to global trade were specifically cited in this survey, with some respondents noting the potential for tariff barriers to prompt retaliatory protectionist policies that would negatively affect global trade flows and put renewed upward pressure on inflation,"" the survey found. ""Others noted that a deterioration in global trade could depress economic activity and raise the risk of a downturn."" ""Persistent inflation"" alongside tight Fed monetary policy had been cited as the top risk in a prior survey issued in the spring, but fell to sixth place, alongside global trade, in the current poll. TRUMP POLICIES The survey, published as part of the Fed's biannual financial stability report, was conducted among two dozen financial sector participants and observers from August to October. While that preceded Trump's election win, the poll highlights issues likely to be central in coming debates on taxes, tariffs, and other economic issues. Some economists see Trump's anticipated combination of tax cuts and import tariffs as potentially fueling both inflation and already large federal deficits at a time when bond markets have been keeping yields elevated on U.S. Treasury bonds. The list of near-term risks to stability published on Friday is reminiscent of the two 2019 financial stability reports, when ""trade frictions"" were the top concern after Trump had launched a trade war with China and had forced Mexico and Canada to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. The document also shows Trump inheriting a financial system that seems largely solid from many perspectives, but with some notable pressures emerging. Asset values ""remained elevated,"" the report concluded, a concern since rich pricing can mean steeper reversals if sentiment or conditions change, with liquidity low and commercial property prices under stress. Household borrowing was ""modest,"" but delinquency was rising on some types of loans, and businesses had borrowed heavily. Banks, many of them under Fed supervision with closely watched capital levels, ""remained sound and resilient."" One particular asset class, the ""stablecoins"" used as part of the cryptocurrency system, was called out as both growing and ""vulnerable to runs.""

The €92 billion industrial conglomerate Bosch said 450 of its employees would reduce their hours and, accordingly, their pay starting next spring, a company spokesperson told Fortune. Employees affected will drop their hours from between 38 and 40 hours a week to 35 hours starting March 1. The spokesperson cited a “difficult economic situation” for its decision to reduce the hours worked by some employees, primarily at its Stuttgart and Gerlingen locations. Bosch has been caught in the maelstrom faced by European carmakers as they crumble from falling demand in Europe and overseas in addition to unprecedented pressure from Chinese competitors. Bosch is Europe’s 24th largest firm by revenue, operating in consumer products, mobility, and industrial technology. However, it makes over half its revenues from its automotive supply business, producing things like brakes and spark plugs. In October, the group said it planned to lay off 7,000 employees as its chairman Stefan Hartung announced the company wouldn’t meet its financial targets for 2024. Hartung refused to rule out further personnel reductions at the troubled supplier. Fellow German automotive giant Volkswagen is in a long battle with its powerful works council to reduce its administrative costs amid a wider €10 billion cost-cutting drive. The carmaker has proposed a 10% pay cut for staff and hasn’t ruled out the potential for its first-ever Germany plant closure. Profits at Volkswagen fell to a three-year low in the first half of 2024. Other European automotive companies have experimented with reducing the working hours of their employees to keep the lights on. In February, Stellantis-owned Fiat cut employees’ working hours at its Turin plant from a double-shift to a single-shift pattern, while it furloughed other workers. The grisly economic context in Germany gives an indication of the challenges faced by its biggest firms. The country expects a second consecutive year of negative economic growth, as its manufacturing sector languishes in more than two years of recession. The country has faced an omnicrisis of high energy prices following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and falling external demand, which has hit its export-heavy economy.

In the 1983 film ""Trading Places"" two very rich and very mean old brothers, Randolph and Mortimer Duke, decide to swap the lives of their firm’s managing director — portrayed by Dan Ackroyd — with Eddie Murphy’s street hustler character in a nature versus nurture wager. Related: Top Wall Street analyst unveils unexpected S&P 500 price target for 2025 The climax on the commodities trading floor sees Ackroyd and Murphy joining forces to ruin the Duke brothers while enriching themselves.

Free Newsletter From TheStreet - TheStreet 🐻 Nearly 30 years later, in 2010, the film was cited by Gary Gensler, then chief of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and currently chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. He called for a ban on using misappropriated government information to trade in the commodity markets — just like the characters in the film. The result was an addition to the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act, which became known as the Eddie Murphy Rule. Now TheStreet Pro's Doug Kass is reflecting on the high levels of enthusiasm surrounding today's market, and he sees a warning in ""Trading Places"" stemming from the Duke Brothers' desperate bid to avoid bankruptcy. The stock market surged on Nov. 6, the day after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidency for the second time, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq all posted fresh record highs. Most observers are expecting an easing of regulations under the new administration, and several investment firms are seeing brighter days ahead. Analysts at Wells Fargo Investment Institute said they were raising their forecast targets for U.S. economic growth — measured by gross domestic product growth and Consumer Price Index inflation — “as we anticipate a significant infusion of new cash from strong equity market performance and the U.S. Treasury, as well as gradual deregulation.” Related: Walmart issues warning as Trump preps massive tariff hikes The firm said in a Nov. 20 research note that the expectation of extra economic strength, as well as expected new immigration and tariff policies, also boosted its year-end inflation forecast. ""Our forecast and target changes reflect improving conditions in the US economy and lack the policy changes from the incoming administration in Washington,"" Wells Fargo said.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/social-media-ban-children-younger-010051640.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 5:00 PM","MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Australia’s communications minister introduced a world-first law into Parliament on Thursday that would ban children younger than 16 from social media, saying online safety was one of parents’ toughest challenges. Michelle Rowland said TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram were among the platforms that would face fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars ($33 million) for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts. “This bill seeks to set a new normative value in society that accessing social media is not the defining feature of growing up in Australia,” Rowland told Parliament. “There is wide acknowledgement that something must be done in the immediate term to help prevent young teens and children from being exposed to streams of content unfiltered and infinite,” she added. The bill has wide political support. After it becomes law, the platforms would have one year to work out how to implement the age restriction. “For too many young Australians, social media can be harmful. Almost two-thirds of 14- to 17-years-old Australians have viewed extremely harmful content online including drug abuse, suicide or self-harm as well as violent material. One quarter have been exposed to content promoting unsafe eating habits,” Rowland said. Government research found that “95% of Australian care-givers find online safety to be one of their toughest parenting challenges,” she said. Social media had a social responsibility and could do better in addressing harms on their platforms, she said. “This is about protecting young people, not punishing or isolating them, and letting parents know that we’re in their corner when it comes to supporting their children’s health and wellbeing,” Rowland said. Child welfare and internet experts have raised concerns about the ban, including isolating 14- and 15-year-olds from their already established online social networks. Rowland said there would not be age restrictions placed on messaging services, online games or platforms that substantially support the health and education of users. “We are not saying risks don’t exist on messaging apps or online gaming. While users can still be exposed to harmful content by other users, they do not face the same algorithmic curation of content and psychological manipulation to encourage near-endless engagement,” Rowland said. The government announced last week that a consortium led by British company Age Check Certification Scheme has been contracted to examine various technologies to estimate and verify ages. In addition to removing children under 16 from social media, Australia is also looking for ways to prevent children under 18 from accessing online pornography, a government statement said. Age Check Certification Scheme’s chief executive Tony Allen said Monday the technologies being considered included age estimation and age inference. Inference involves establishing a series of facts about individuals that point to them being at least a certain age. Rowland said the platforms would also face fines of up to AU$50 million ($33 million) if they misused personal information of users gained for age-assurance purposes. Information used for age assurances must be destroyed after serving that purpose unless the user consents to it being kept, she said.

Here’s What Could Kill It Product revenue, which makes up the bulk of Snowflake’s business, will be $906 million to $911 million in the period ending in January, the company said Wednesday in a statement. Analysts, on average, predicted $890.7 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Adjusted operating margin will be about 4%, while analysts expected 1.7%. Snowflake’s software pulls in, organizes and analyzes data from a variety of sources. Under Chief Executive Officer Sridhar Ramaswamy, the company has introduced products that use generative AI and allow people to analyze more types of data. Product cohesion and ease of use is “leading us to win new logo after new logo, expand within our customer base, and displace our competition over and over again,” Ramaswamy said in the statement. As part of this effort, Snowflake announced it has agreed to acquire Datavolo Inc., a startup that allows easier ingestion of unstructured data, which is unorganized information from other sources that often is used to fuel generative AI. The deal will make it easier for customers to analyze more information within Snowflake and build AI-based applications on that data, Ramaswamy said in an interview. Earlier this year, Datavolo announced more than $21 million in funding from firms including General Catalyst, Citi Ventures, and Rob Bearden, the former CEO of Cloudera Inc. No terms were disclosed for the acquisition. The shares rose about 16% in extended trading, after closing at $129.12 in New York. The stock had plunged 35% this year through Wednesday’s close, with investor sentiment “frigid,” wrote Brent Bracelin, an analyst at Piper Sandler, ahead of the results. That’s due to concerns over slowing consumption on the platform, recent leadership changes, competition and wider economic pressures, he added. Snowflake’s product expansion strategy is fueled in part by increased pressure from rivals including Databricks Inc. and cloud infrastructure providers like Microsoft Corp. Snowflake often touts its ease-of-use of as a competitive advantage. “Our competition is a bunch of strung-together stuff where customers have to spend lots and lots on engineers to get everything to work,” Ramaswamy said when asked about Databricks. Fiscal third-quarter product revenue increased 29% to $900.3 million, compared with the $856.6 million average estimate. Profit, excluding some items, was 20 cents per share, beating the average analyst estimate of 15 cents per share.

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting NYC Mayor Adams Names Jessica Tisch to Lead Police Head Amid Probes The company’s overall headcount in its home market fell to 211,000 as of Sept. 29, down from 228,000 a year earlier, according to a regulatory filing Wednesday. Of that total, 201,000 work in the company’s cafes, down 8% from 219,000 in 2023. It’s the second straight year that the tally of US workers has fallen. At the same time, Starbucks added a net 513 company-operated stores in the US, bringing the total to 10,158. Starbucks’ operations are under scrutiny following a sales slump that led to the abrupt ouster of Chief Executive Officer Laxman Narasimhan. He was replaced with industry veteran Brian Niccol, who is leading turnaround efforts that include simplifying the company’s menu and making its cafes more welcoming, in part by adding more comfortable seats. Headcount has been an area of concern for employees, and staffing levels ranked as the issue with the lowest approval rating in an internal company poll that was conducted in April. “We are constantly only given a skeleton staff,” one worker said in comments collected as part of the survey results. The workers said low staffing levels lead to drink and food order backlogs. Starbucks says it has increased the number of hours employees get each week on average, which allows staff to earn more and maintain benefits.

The filing also showed a rise in the share of unionized workers, with the percentage rising to 5% at the end of the company’s fiscal year, up from 3.6% a year earlier. Earlier this year, Starbucks and its union started talks about how to achieve collective-bargaining agreements and provide a fair process for union organizing, seeking to end an impasse.

""I've also spent time with our team talking about, OK, when something is announced, we want to be doing pricing actions with our customers of some magnitude. And so we've actually started to have some of those conversations with our channel customers in the last week or two,"" Allan told Yahoo Finance (video above). ""We won't do anything until we see something that says here's what the new world of tariffs is going to be."" Allan said he's been spending time with politicians and people close to the incoming Trump administration to help them understand the impact of potential tariffs. Despite the tariff threat, Allan and his team presented upbeat long-term guidance at an investor day in New York City on Wednesday. The company outlined a fiscal year 2027 sales target of $16.5 billion to $17 billion. Analysts are looking for full-year sales of $15.26 billion for 2024. Operating profits for 2027 are projected to be about $2.5 billion. Wall Street is modeling for $1.6 billion in operating profits for this year. Added Allan on tariffs, ""When I look at our industry, if I took our Chinese operation that we have today that makes power tools and brought it over in the US, the cost to make that product would be about 60% to 70% higher. So it's substantial, which the consumer will not pay for. And so if we're going to reduce our China exposure, which we are, we'll be looking at other southeast Asian countries like Vietnam or maybe Mexico, where we certainly have a significant operation already."" Any proposed tariffs on China or Europe would come at an inopportune time for Stanley Black & Decker. Shares of the company are down 11.8% year to date, compared to a 23% advance for the S&P 500. Its earnings results have been pressured by consumer weakness impacting do-it-yourself home projects at major retailers Home Depot (HD) and Lowe's (LOW). In the meantime, housing demand remains choppy amid high prices and high mortgage rates. Stanley's third quarter sales fell 5% from a year ago. Sales fell 3% in the Tools and Outdoor segment and by 18% in the Industrial segment. The company struck a downbeat tone on business trends through early 2025 when it reported in late October. It sees sales in the first half of 2025 being flat to down year over year. The forward price-to-earnings multiple on Stanley Black & Decker is now 14 times, below the five-year mean of 20.1 times, according to Yahoo Finance data. The S&P 500 trades on a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 22 times. ""We continue to see the potential for improved visibility for earnings growth for the sector alongside an increased likelihood for lower interest rates over the next 12 months, which in turn should spur further housing transactions and repair/remodeling activity,"" said JPMorgan analyst Michael Rehaut in a recent client note on the company. Added Rehaut, ""However, we also view our target multiple, still at more than one turn below where the stock is trading against our 2025E EBITDA [estimate] as well as more than two turns below its 10-year average, as appropriately reflecting our more conservative earnings outlook over the next two years relative to both the Street and buy-side expectations, which in turn we expect will drive additional multiple compression. Rehaut rates Stanley Black & Decker shares at Underweight, or Sell equivalent. Of the 19 sell-side analysts that cover the company, 16 rate it a Hold or Sell, per Yahoo Finance data.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cambridge-capital-founder-predicts-m-232634031.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 3:26 PM","After a two-year freight recession and a drastic pullback in lending from private equity- and venture capital-backed firms investing in supply chain technology after the COVID pandemic, Benjamin Gordon, founder and managing partner of Cambridge Capital, says there’s been a resurgence in strategic mergers and acquisitions. Gordon and FreightWaves CEO Craig Fuller discussed current trends for the freight and logistics M&A market on Wednesday at FreightWaves’ F3: Future of Freight Festival. Gordon noted the recent acquisition of U.S-based IMC Logistics by global freight forwarder Kuehne+Nagel, which acquired a majority share of the drayage company nearly a week ago, as an example of a strategic M&A. “Kuehne+Nagel didn’t have to buy anything, but number one, public companies are under pressure to buy more,” Gordon said at the Chattanooga, Tennessee, event. “If you were a public logistics company and you were growing 10-20% during COVID, then post-COVID and during the freight recession of the last two years, your shareholders were expecting you to grow. You weren’t performing, but it wasn’t your fault. It was a freight recession. But now it’s time to lean in.” Over the next year, Gordon predicts that private equity-backed logistics companies will start buying freight-related businesses after a challenging few years post-COVID. “The challenge with the private equity-backed logistics companies that have lived through the freight recession in the last two years, there’s this great reset in terms of valuation,” he said. “If you’ve lived through the freight recession in the last two years, and there’s this great reset in terms of valuation, most private equity buyers today, in order to finance their acquisitions, will have to put more cash in.” However, Gordon said that’s what’s been holding back private equity-backed logistics firms from buying businesses that would rather use debt to pay for their acquisitions. “But, because, if you bought during 2021 or 2022, your EBITDA is lower, your debt ratios are higher and therefore, you need fresh equity to put in,” he said. Gordon predicts that in 2025, large corporations will make decisions and deals to divest parts of their businesses that don’t fit their business needs anymore. Fuller discussed international ocean container companies that had all-time-high profits in 2021 and 2022 during the supply chain challenges of the COVID pandemic that have leaned into the U.S. domestic market. “Is it a reflection of the confidence in the U.S. market , the U.S. consumer and the U.S. economy,” he said. “What is really driving that change?” Gordon said there are multiple factors behind that push. “It’s both of those factors and then there’s also a third, and that is a lot of the big steamship companies recognize that ‘live by the sword, die by the sword’ of the ocean cycle is not a great place to be. You’d rather have more predictability,” Gordon said. He added that Maersk said it would like the majority of its profit to come from non-steamship activities and services. “So diversification is a big element, and I think that’s why Maersk and other big steamship companies are looking to diversify for all those reasons, to expand it and to deploy the excess cash from that spike,” Gordon said. What is Gordon bullish about in VC? He said there are a couple of targeted areas that VC-backed companies are interested in investing in, including AI-based funding. “Clearly, this is not just true for FreightTech – it’s true for the venture world as a whole,” Gordon said. “So AI, I think right now it’s maybe like the internet was in 1999 you know: It’s frothy.” He said there’s been a lot of funding activity and innovation in areas that make a better workflow, including voice recognition to help truckers with their businesses. Asked by Fuller if there’s any business out there that is off the radar that he’s incredibly enamored of right now, Gordon said to look for the customer pain point. “There was a period of time where a lot of people were chasing what was getting venture attention, and oftentimes, that’s the worst thing that you want to do, because you’re chasing what everybody else is chasing.” The post Cambridge Capital founder predicts M&A resurgence in 2025 appeared first on FreightWaves.","After a two-year freight recession and a drastic from private equity- and venture firms in supply chain technology COVID Benjamin founder and managing partner of Cambridge Capital, been a resurgence in strategic mergers acquisitions. and FreightWaves CEO Craig Fuller discussed current and logistics M&A market on Wednesday F3: Future of Freight Gordon the recent acquisition of U.S-based IMC Logistics by global forwarder Kuehne+Nagel, acquired a majority share of company nearly a week ago, as an example of a strategic M&A. have buy anything, but number one, public companies are pressure to buy Gordon said at the Chattanooga, Tennessee, event. “If you public company and were growing 10-20% during COVID, post-COVID and freight recession the two years, were expecting you You weren’t performing, but wasn’t your fault.

In the company’s third-quarter earnings report for 2024, Target revealed that its comparable sales only increased by a measly 0.3% during the quarter, compared to the same time period last year. 💰💸 Don’t miss the move: SIGN UP for TheStreet’s FREE Daily newsletter 💰💸 While the traffic in its stores grew by about 2% year-over-year, the amount of money customers are spending per purchase shrunk by 2%. Related: Target slashes prices ahead of holiday shopping surge The declines have contributed to Target facing a 12% decrease in its net earnings during the quarter. During a recent earnings call, Target CEO Brian Cornell stated that consumers are continuing to be more cautious with their spending, despite the company’s recent efforts to lower prices. “When we assess the consumer and macro environment, we're seeing many of the same themes that have defined the environment for some time,” said Cornell. “Consumers tell us their budgets remain stretched and they're shopping carefully as they work to overcome the cumulative impact of multiple years of price inflation.” Justin Sullivan/Getty Images In October, Target lowered prices on over 2,000 items that are in categories such as food and beverages, everyday essentials, and holiday gifts/prep. The move from Target came after it slashed its prices on over 5,000 items in May. Some areas where Target saw its customers pull back on their spending during the third quarter include cold weather apparel, home goods, and hardline goods (non-personal items such as appliances, electronics, furniture, etc.). During the call, Cornell claims that consumers are continuing to make “trade-offs” to save on everyday essentials in order to afford “must-have items,” and as a result, they have grown to become more “resourceful.” Related: Target makes bold clarification to return policy amid alarming trend “They're becoming increasingly resourceful in their shopping behaviors, waiting to buy until (the) last moment of need, focusing on deals and then stocking up when they find them,” said Cornell. “As a result, we're seeing a strong response to promotions than we've seen in some time.” Cornell also claimed that consumers are increasingly “willing to wait for sales and willing to search across multiple retailers to find them.” The current trend in consumer shopping behavior has caused Target to unveil a grim outlook on its sales during the holiday season. The retailer is now predicting that during the fourth quarter of this year, it will have “flat” comparable sales. “We're focused on planning the business cautiously based on the volatility we've encountered so far this year,” said Target Chief Financial Officer Jim Lee during the earnings call. “Our expectations also reflect some unique attributes of this year's calendar including the loss of five shopping days between Thanksgiving and Christmas and the shift in this year's fiscal calendar after last year's 53rd week.” More Retail: PepsiCo’s plan to buy a popular brand draws threats from consumers Target makes bold clarification to return policy amid alarming trend H&M is the latest victim of an alarming shift in consumer behavior Target’s disappointing outlook comes after a recent survey from the National Retail Federation revealed that holiday spending this year is expected to reach a new record high. According to the survey, consumers are expected to spend about $902 per person on “gifts, food, decorations and other seasonal items.” This is $25 more than what each consumer was predicted to spend in last year’s survey, and $16 higher than the previous planned spending record of $886 per person in 2019. Brandon Bell/Getty Images As Target expects challenges with its holiday sales, it is continuing to roll out deals and discounts in order to help attract customers back into its stores. One of the deals that the retailer is promoting involves the return of its Thanksgiving meal deal which is now $20. Last year, the meal was priced at $25. Target’s recent struggles with its sales came after the retailer faced a massive boycott from consumers over its pride collection during the summer last year. Conservative consumers took issue with the company selling transgender swimsuits and marketing LGBTQ merchandise toward children. The boycott appears to have contributed to the company facing a 5.4% decline in sales during the second quarter of 2023. Ever since the controversy, Target has been on a rocky road to recovery. To avoid blowback from consumers, the company even scaled back its pride collection this year, which angered some of the designers of the collection.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/h-ai-startup-raised-220m-175312424.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 9:53 AM","H, the Paris startup founded by Google alums, made a big splash last summer when, out of the blue, it announced a seed round of $220 million, before releasing a single product. Three months later, still without a product, that splash started to look like a catastrophic flood when three of the company’s five co-founders left over “operational and business disagreements.” But the company has kept swimming, and today it’s announcing its first product: Runner H, an “agentic” AI aimed at businesses and developers across tasks like quality assurance and process automation, based on the startup’s own, proprietary “compact” LLM based on just 2 billion parameters. H has set up a waitlist for Runner H on its site. Kantor said that it will be releasing APIs to those on the list over the coming days to use agents “off the shelf” that have been pre-built by H, as well as to develop their own. Access to the API will also come along with access to something called H-Studio to test and manage how your services work. Initially, using those APIs will be free and later there will be a payment model introduced. Even using compact LLMs, building and running AI is not cheap, especially as competition continues to raise money to develop their own products. TechCrunch has also confirmed that H is raising a Series A, to build what Charles Kantor, the CEO who is one of the co-founders who stayed, describes H as part of the second era of AI — with LLM companies like OpenAI being part of the first era. “We are lucky to be in the position of building our own models,” Kantor said. “But this second era will be as capital intensive as first one.” (Recall the $230 million H has already raised — it appears to have added another $10 million since announcing it earlier this year — was a mixture of equity and convertible debt. The long list of investors in that round included individuals like Eric Schmidt, Yuri Milner and Xavier Neil; VCs such as Accel and Creandum; and strategic backers like Amazon, Samsung and UiPath.) Kantor told TechCrunch that H has quietly been working with a handful of customers in areas like e-commerce, banking, insurance and outsourcing, who have been helping it hone the product. “Everything [in H] is not based on our creativity but customer feedback,” he said. Runner H will initially focus on three specific use cases: robotic process automation (RPA), quality assurance, and business process outsourcing. RPA is an area that has existed for years, using basic scripts to automate the most repetitive tasks that humans have had to perform — such as reading forms, checking boxes and sending files from one place to another. In fact, a lot of RPA has never been built with AI baked in, even after AI started to develop advanced skills. The idea with Runner H is that it will be able to run RPA across forms, sites and other templates even when they have been modified (something that might have broken previous scripts), and across a much wider range of sources. Quality assurance can cover a wide range of applications, but Kantor said that one of the most popular so far has been reducing the “maintenance burdens” around website testing — validating page availability, simulating real user actions, or ensuring compatibility across payment methods — in particular when any modifications have been made. BPO is a catch-all area that will cover not just fixing and improving billing processes, but also speeding up how an agent can use and access data from different sources, and more. There has been a race among foundational AI companies around how many parameters are going into LLMs. (GPT 4 for example has 175 billion parameters.)

That third-party service included an algorithm designed to score rental applicants, which became the subject of a class action lawsuit, with Louis at the helm, alleging that the algorithm discriminated on the basis of race and income. A federal judge approved a settlement in the lawsuit, one of the first of it's kind, on Wednesday, with the company behind the algorithm agreeing to pay over $2.2 million and roll back certain parts of it's screening products that the lawsuit alleged were discriminatory. The settlement does not include any admissions of fault by the company SafeRent Solutions, which said in a statement that while it “continues to believe the SRS Scores comply with all applicable laws, litigation is time-consuming and expensive."" While such lawsuits might be relatively new, the use of algorithms or artificial intelligence programs to screen or score Americans isn't. For years, AI has been furtively helping make consequential decisions for U.S. residents. When a person submits a job application, applies for a home loan or even seeks certain medical care, there’s a chance that an AI system or algorithm is scoring or assessing them like it did Louis. Those AI systems, however, are largely unregulated, even though some have been found to discriminate. “Management companies and landlords need to know that they’re now on notice, that these systems that they are assuming are reliable and good are going to be challenged,” said Todd Kaplan, one of Louis’ attorneys. The lawsuit alleged SafeRent's algorithm didn't take into account the benefits of housing vouchers, which they said was an important detail for a renter's ability to pay the monthly bill, and it therefore discriminated against low-income applicants who qualified for the aid. The suit also accused SafeRent's algorithm of relying too much on credit information. They argued that it fails to give a full picture of an applicant's ability to pay rent on time and unfairly dings applicants with housing vouchers who are Black and Hispanic partly because they have lower median credit scores, attributable to historical inequities. Christine Webber, one of the plaintiff's attorneys, said that just because an algorithm or AI is not programmed to discriminate, the data an algorithm uses or weights could have ""the same effect as if you told it to discriminate intentionally.” When Louis' application was denied, she tried appealing the decision, sending two landlords' references to show she’d paid rent early or on time for 16 years, even if she didn't have a strong credit history. Louis, who had a housing voucher, was scrambling, having already given notice to her previous landlord that she was moving out, and she was charged with taking care of her granddaughter. The response from the management company, which used SafeRent's screening service, read, “We do not accept appeals and cannot override the outcome of the Tenant Screening.” Louis felt defeated; the algorithm didn’t know her, she said. “Everything is based on numbers. You don’t get the individual empathy from them,” said Louis. ""There is no beating the system. The system is always going to beat us.” While state lawmakers have proposed aggressive regulations for these types of AI systems, the proposals have largely failed to get enough support. That means lawsuits like Louis’ are starting to lay the groundwork for AI accountability. SafeRent’s defense attorneys argued in a motion to dismiss that the company shouldn’t be held liable for discrimination because SafeRent wasn’t making the final decision on whether to accept or deny a tenant. The service would screen applicants, score them and submit a report, but leave it to landlords or management companies to accept or deny a tenant. Louis’ attorneys, along with the U.S. Department of Justice, which submitted a statement of interest in the case, argued that SafeRent’s algorithm could be held accountable because it still plays a role in access to housing. The judge denied SafeRent's motion to dismiss on those counts. The settlement stipulates that SafeRent can't include its score feature on its tenant screening reports in certain cases, including if the applicant is using a housing voucher. It also requires that if SafeRent develops another screening score it plans to use, it must be validated by a third-party that the plaintiffs agree to. Louis' son found an affordable apartment for her on Facebook Marketplace that she has since moved into, though it was $200 more expensive and in a less desirable area. “I’m not optimistic that I’m going to catch a break, but I have to keep on keeping, that’s it,” said Louis. “I have too many people who rely on me.” ___ Jesse Bedayn is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

After a three-week trial, the jury concluded that New Hampshire-based Sig Sauer was negligent for selling a defective gun and holster. The plaintiff's lawyers said the P320 pistol is prone to going off without the trigger being pulled, a defect that has led to scores of injuries around the U.S. More than 100 people have come forward to make similar allegations about the P320. Sig Sauer insists the gun is safe. “We've been asking Sig for over three years now to recall this gun, to fix it, and frankly to use the same type of safeties that other manufacturers are using that Sig Sauer is not,” Robert W. Zimmerman, the plaintiff's lawyer, said after the verdict. He added that the verdict “sends a strong message to Sig Sauer that they need to do something with this gun.” Zimmerman represented George Abrahams, a U.S. Army veteran and painting contractor in Philadelphia, who has said he holstered his P320, put it in the pocket of his athletic pants and zipped it up before going downstairs. The gun went off and the bullet tore through his right thigh, exiting above the knee, causing permanent injuries, according to court documents. At trial, Sig Sauer sought to shift blame to Abrahams. The company said in a statement posted on its website that jurors had “agreed that plaintiff’s own negligence contributed to his accident,"" and it defended the P320 as “among the most tested, proven, and successful handguns in recent history.” “We strongly disagree with the verdict in this unintended discharge lawsuit ... and will be appealing the decision on multiple grounds,"" the company said. Earlier this year, a federal jury awarded $2.35 million to a Georgia man who was wounded when his holstered P320 went off. Zimmerman's law firm, Saltz Mongeluzzi Bendesky, also represented that plaintiff, and has a raft of other pending claims against Sig Sauer. The company has indicated it plans to appeal the Georgia verdict. “We have said it before, and juries are now speaking loud and clear with their verdicts; this gun is a danger to gun owners and anyone within the vicinity of this gun,” Ryan Hurd, Zimmerman's co-counsel, said in a statement Wednesday. Abrahams' lawsuit, which was filed in 2022, recounted dozens of unintended discharge incidents involving the P320, of which lawyers have estimated there are about a half-million in circulation in the U.S. The suit asserted the P320 “is the most dangerous pistol for its users sold in the United States market.” The military version of the pistol comes with an external safety to prevent unintended discharges, according to plaintiffs' lawyers, but the model sold to police departments and civilians does not. In 2019, the unintentional discharge of a Philadelphia transit officer’s holstered P320 prompted SEPTA, the city’s transit agency, to remove all of its P320 handguns from service and replace them with Glocks. Sig Sauer has settled at least one federal class action lawsuit involving the P320, involving pistols made before 2017, offering refunds or replacement guns to purchasers.","A Philadelphia jury awarded $11 on Wednesday a whose holstered Sig Sauer went off by itself he stairs, causing serious injury the second major this against gun manufacturer P320 model.

For the three months that ended Oct. 27, the tech giant based in Santa Clara, California, posted revenue of $35.08 billion, up 94% from $18.12 billion a year ago. Nvidia said it earned $19.31 billion in the quarter, more than double the $9.24 billion it posted in last year’s third quarter. Adjusted for one-time items, it earned 81 cents a share. Wall Street analysts had been expecting adjusted earnings of 75 cents a share on revenue of $33.17 billion, according to FactSet. Investors took the results in stride, however, and Nvidia’s high-flying stock slipped about 1% in after-hours trading. Shares in Nvidia Corp. are up 195% so far this year. “The age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to Nvidia computing,” Jensen Huang, founder and CEO of Nvidia, said in a statement. Analysts’ were eyeing Nvidia’s guidance on its Blackwell graphics processor unit, a next-generation artificial intelligence chip that's seen demand from companies like OpenAI and others building AI data centers. Over the summer, the tech juggernaut said it would increase production of its Blackwell AI chips beginning in the fourth quarter and continuing through fiscal 2026. Huang said in an interview with CNBC last month that demand for Blackwell is “insane.” “Everybody wants to have the most and everybody wants to be first,” Huang said. Nvidia has led the artificial intelligence sector to become one of the stock market’s biggest companies, as tech giants spend heavily on the company’s chips and data centers needed to train and operate their AI systems. The company carved out an early lead in AI applications race, in part because of Huang’s successful bet on the chip technology used to fuel the industry. The company is no stranger to big bets. Nvidia’s invention of graphics processor chips, or GPUs, in 1999 helped spark the growth of the PC gaming market and redefined computer graphics. Demand for generative AI products that can compose documents, make images and serve as personal assistants has fueled sales of Nvidia’s specialized chips over the last year. Nvidia, the most valuable publicly traded company by market cap as of Wednesday morning, is now worth over $3.5 trillion, with analysts closely monitoring Nvidia's path to $4 trillion. Through the year’s first six months, Nvidia’s stock soared nearly 150%. At that point, the stock was trading at a little more than 100 times the company’s earnings over the prior 12 months.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hyundai-unveils-big-electric-suv-010708309.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 6:07 PM","By Abhirup Roy SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Hyundai Motor unveiled its first three-row electric SUV on Wednesday, pushing into a market for big family cars that global automakers hope will one day be a profit powerhouse. Hyundai's IONIQ 9 will roll out in the United States and Korea early next year with a range of more than 300 miles, the Korean automaker said in a statement. Launches in Europe and other markets will follow, it said. Three-row SUVs have replaced minivans and station wagons to become the big car of choice for many soccer moms and dads carrying kids and friends around town as well as road trips with lots of passengers and gear. Most EVs are money-losing. But profits from the gasoline-powered versions promise automakers big payoffs as battery costs decline, and early launches give the brands a headstart in the emerging market segment. Lucid, General Motors' Cadillac, Volvo and Vinfast all are launching three-row EVs, while Hyundai corporate cousin Kia already has its own version. ""It's a very important segment on the gas side,"" said Sam Fiorani, vice president at research firm AutoForecast Solutions. ""The problem with it is that they are large vehicles and finding a way to design a battery pack around all the storage and the utility of a three-row takes a concerted effort."" Moreover, big batteries are not enough to avoid charging during long road trips. Still, automakers need to get into the three-row SUV market to give loyal customers options, Fiorani said. ""If you aren't in that field where they expect you to be, they're going to move to somebody else, and it's much easier to keep a customer happy than to win a customer away from another brand."" With current incentives, Fiorani forecast that the new models will help to more than double sales of three-row EVs to around 150,000 next year, from an estimated 68,000 this year. The handful of models in the market with three-row versions includes Rivian's R1S, starting at $76,000 and Tesla's Model X, which starts at $80,000. There is also a Model Y three-row variant. Lucid started taking orders for its $95,000 Gravity SUV this month and Vietnamese EV maker VinFast on Tuesday started delivering the VF 9 SUV with a $70,000 starting price. Hyundai did not disclose a price for the IONIQ 9, but the Kia EV9 starts at $55,000, and models from the related companies are often similarly priced. Hyundai aims to have a full lineup of 23 EV models by 2030. The IONIQ 9, built in Georgia, will be able to charge from 10% to 80% in 24 minutes at high-capacity charging stations, and it is compatible with Tesla's Supercharger network. TEMPERED ESTIMATES Most automakers are pressing ahead with their plans even as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has promised to pull back government incentives for EVs. However, Ford in August shelved plans to produce an electric three-row SUV, choosing instead to build hybrid SUVs to woo customers with longer-range vehicles for road trips. Rivals are also responding to rising consumer demand for cars with gas-powered engines and a small battery pack as a less expensive way to go electric. ""The whole EV market right now is difficult and (building three-row EVs) is especially difficult because of the higher prices and costs associated with it,"" said Jessica Caldwell, head of insights at auto research firm Edmunds. The vehicles are part of automakers' long term strategy to expand EV offerings, but ""expectations definitely need to be tempered in terms of volume in this segment,"" she said. The high price and limited range, especially for family road trips, restrict the appeal of such vehicles to early EV adopters, she added. The target audience of wealthy buyers for three-row SUVs should not be discouraged by Trump's plans to cut a $7,500 federal tax credit for EV buyers, analysts said, noting that most do not qualify for such subsidies anyway. Still, it does not help, Caldwell said. ""I think it just makes the package seem a lot less attractive.""

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/storm-barrage-threatens-philippine-growth-230550816.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 3:05 PM","(Bloomberg) -- Six powerful storms late in the season that ravaged crops and drenched vast areas of the Philippines have put the nation on track for record rice imports and raised concerns over elevated food inflation. Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting NYC Mayor Adams Names Jessica Tisch to Lead Police Head Amid Probes From the end of October to mid-November, the storms repeatedly dumped heavy rain over northern regions grappling with widespread flooding and saturated soil that couldn’t absorb any more water. The onslaught caused at least $131 million of crop losses, with rice bearing the brunt of the damage. The last time six tropical cyclones impacted the Philippines over a three-week period was in 1946, according to President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who said rice imports may climb to a record 4.5 million tons this year to fill supply gaps. The peak of the nation’s typhoon season is typically July through October. “We don’t have anything to harvest anymore because of the storms,” said Jespher Villegas, a rice farmer in the town of Gonzaga in Cagayan province. His entire crop was submerged by floodwaters and rain is continuing in the region, he added, with his corn and a tilapia fish farm also affected. The Philippines is on the front line for typhoons in the Asia-Pacific, with around 20 tropical cyclones forming each year near the archipelago. Some storms make landfall, and some can track toward other countries in the region, soaking coffee crops in Vietnam and shutting stock trading in Taiwan. Warm seas helped to fuel the most active season in the Western Pacific in seven decades this month, stirring up four typhoons, all of which made landfall in the Philippines. Even before the latest string of tropical cyclones, storms had sapped third-quarter growth and reduced rice production. Ruined Rice Nearly 600,000 tons of rough rice crops have been ruined by storms this year, according to the Philippines’ Department of Agriculture’s disaster management center. Over half was destroyed by Severe Tropical Storm Trami, which hit the major rice-growing region of Cagayan Valley in October. Cagayan Valley and Central Luzon, which account for a third of the nation’s rice output, are two regions that were heavily drenched by the six storms. Prolonged rainfall can lead to a favorable environment for “grain-sucking rice bugs” that can attack at any time, the weather bureau warned. The main rice crop is harvested in the last quarter of the year, and Agriculture Undersecretary Christopher Morales estimates annual output in 2024 may dip by about 1 million tons from a year ago to around 19 million tons. Still, imports are expected to remain elevated next year. Overseas purchases could be between 4.5 million to 5 million tons next year to cover crop losses and higher consumption from a growing population, said Oscar Tjakra, senior analyst for Rabobank in Singapore. The Philippines imported 3.6 million tons in 2023, according to government data. Food Inflation “There’s high potential for more rice imports given disruptions to local rice production, which poses upside risk to food inflation and downside risk to economic activity,” according to Angelo Taningco, chief economist at Security Bank Corp. in Manila. The storms have also impacted tourism, construction, manufacturing, transport and retail trade, he said. Gross domestic product growth this year will likely come in below the Marcos government’s target of at least 6%, Taningco added. Other crops have been destroyed by weather this year, including more than 350,000 tons of corn and over 112,000 tons of vegetables, according to figures from the government. Warmer temperatures caused by El Niño earlier in 2025 contributed to the damage, which has been exacerbated by recent storms. Supply shortfalls risk boosting inflation, which accelerated in October on price gains in rice and other food items. To combat further hikes, the government is considering importing fish and vegetables, Agriculture Assistant Secretary Arnel de Mesa said on Tuesday. “There’s a lot of rice and other crops that have been destroyed and we just have to compensate for that,” President Marcos said on Friday. --With assistance from Keira Wright, Mary Hui and Sanjit Das.

The meeting “means that the industry minister welcomes Apple’s investment commitment,” ministry spokesperson Febri Hendri Antoni Arif said in the statement. The statement confirmed an earlier report by Bloomberg News that Apple has increased its offer to invest in Indonesia by almost tenfold, after initially offering a close to $10 million investment to undo the sale ban. Indonesia’s government blocked sales of the iPhone 16 on the grounds the US tech company’s local unit hasn’t met a 40% domestic content requirement for smartphones and tablets.

Earlier Wednesday, US equity benchmarks were largely unchanged while stock futures for Japan and Hong Kong fell Thursday. An index of the dollar rose 0.4% Wednesday, helped along by higher Treasury yields and haven demand for the US currency as geopolitical tensions escalated. Ukraine used British cruise missiles against Russian targets for the first time during the conflict. The increase in yields, which reflects a decline in bond prices, partly reflected a lackluster auction for 20-year US government debt. The tepid response to Nvidia’s earnings may ripple across global markets, given the size of the world’s largest company by market value and its role in the artificial intelligence boom. “The health of the market being driven by results of individual companies in itself points to a certain element of fragility,” said Subitha Subramaniam, chief economist at Sarasin & Partners. “Is it sufficient that they beat, is it sufficient that they beat by a big margin?

Traders are also monitoring President-elect Donald Trump’s administration picks, especially his selection for the Treasury secretary role. Former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh and Apollo Global Management’s Marc Rowan are contenders, according to people familiar with the matter. Meanwhile, Trump tapped Cantor Fitzgerald LP Chief Executive Officer Howard Lutnick to lead the Commerce Department, a key role to facilitate his tariff and trade policies. “As I look at the Treasury secretary race, I want to see exactly who is in that role because the tax policies, the debt limit all come back,” Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James, told Bloomberg Television. “We need to see exactly how that person has a relationship with the Federal Reserve, because monetary policy will quickly figure into all of this.” Gold was flat early Thursday after notching its third daily advance in the prior session.

Here’s What Could Kill It Fiscal fourth-quarter sales will be about $37.5 billion, the company said in a statement Wednesday. Though the average analyst estimate was $37.1 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, projections ranged as high as $41 billion. The outlook suggests that AI excitement may be getting ahead of reality. Nvidia investors bid up the shares nearly 200% in 2024, turning it into the world’s most valuable company. But the chipmaker has had trouble keeping up with demand for its products and struggled with production snags this year. Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang said that Nvidia’s new lineup, called Blackwell, is now in “full production.” Demand for the products is expected to exceed demand for several quarters. Hopper, the previous design, is still in demand, Huang added. “AI is transforming every industry, company and country,” he said in the statement. “Industrial robotics investments are surging with breakthroughs in physical AI, and countries have awakened to the importance of developing their national AI and infrastructure.” But some investors were looking for more of a blowout quarter. Shares of Nvidia fell about 4% in extended trading following the announcement. They previously closed at $145.89 in New York. Even with a disappointing outlook, Nvidia’s growth over the past two years has been staggering. Its sales are poised to double for a second year in a row, and it now notches more money in profit than it used to generate in total revenue. Nvidia’s revenue rose 94% to $35.1 billion in the fiscal third quarter, which ended Oct. 27. Excluding certain items, profit was 81 cents a share. Analysts had predicted sales of about $33.25 billion and earnings of 74 cents a share. The company’s biggest moneymaker is its accelerator chip, which helps develop AI models by bombarding them with data. Since OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot debuted in 2022, a frenzy of artificial intelligence services has created insatiable demand for the product. Other recent earnings reports have given strong signals for AI. Major Nvidia customers, including Microsoft Corp., Amazon.com Inc.’s AWS and Meta Platforms Inc., have reaffirmed their commitment to spend on AI infrastructure. Nvidia looks to stay ahead of rivals by accelerating its pace of innovation. That includes a commitment to updating its lineup annually. With Blackwell, it has a new collection of chips that are faster and have an improved ability to link up with other semiconductors. But manufacturing challenges have slowed the Blackwell rollout. For now, Nvidia can’t fill all the orders it’s receiving, the company has said. After production improves, supplies will be plentiful, according to Huang. Nvidia has only missed analysts’ estimates on quarterly revenue once in the past five years. And it has exceeded expectations by as much as 20% in recent periods, creating a high bar for its performance. Its data center division alone now has more revenue than its two nearest rivals, Intel Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., have in total combined. Net income this year is on course to exceed revenue at Intel, a business that was the chip industry’s biggest company for decades. Nvidia made its name by selling graphics processors, but discovered that the technology also has applications for AI. Its chips help software models during the training process, when they learn to recognize and respond to real-world inputs. Nvidia’s components are also used in systems that then run the software, a stage known as inference, and help power services such as ChatGPT. The Santa Clara, California-based company has rapidly expanded its product lineup to include networking, software and services, as well as fully built-out computer systems. Huang is traveling the world lobbying for a broader adoption of his technology and trying to spread its use by corporations and government agencies.

""I watched her work day in and day out, and she was wasting about seven to eight hours on boring workflow tasks,"" Suri said. ""Only 5% of her time, she had her radiology thinking cap on. That was really sad."" So, Suri, who was an engineer at big data analytics company Confluent at the time, built New Lantern, a startup that automates tedious radiology-related tasks like making measurements on scans and report writing. Suri (pictured lower center) noticed that his mom's workday revolved primarily around two software systems: PACS, or the digital library of medical images where doctors view scans; and the reporting software where she would translate those images into actionable diagnoses. Switching between tools felt unnecessarily clunky, so New Lantern combined these tools into one platform. Eric Vishria, a general partner at Benchmark, said that he’s looked at other startups working on AI-powered radiology but most focused on image analysis. He passed on those others, in part because the technology isn’t really ready to replace human radiologists. For years, it's been predicted that AI would make radiologists obsolete. But instead, there's a shortage of these professionals. Suri's realization was that instead of using AI to analyze images, AI can help with the drudgery “and let the doctor do what doctors enjoy doing and are really good at, which is reading the scans,"" Vishria said. New Lantern claims that its software can significantly enhance radiologists' efficiency, enabling them to complete twice as many cases in the same timeframe. ""That's what got me really excited about it,"" Vishria said. On Wednesday, New Lantern announced that it raised a $19 million Series A led by Benchmark. New Lantern's goal is to replace and modernize how radiologists work not only with the help of AI but also by ensuring that all data is stored in the cloud. Some vendors of PACS, which stands for Picture Archiving and Communication System, are still hosted on-prem, according to Suri. The incumbent providers of PACS are GE Healthcare and Phillips. Meanwhile, Microsoft's Nuance dominates reporting software, but Rad AI, a Khosla Ventures-backed AI-first company, told TechCrunch that it has gained significant market share. However, New Lantern has big plans to completely disrupt radiology software with its product. ""25 years ago, we made the switch from [physical] film to PACS,"" Suri said. ""We want to be the biggest evolution of the market since PACS was invented."" Suri declined to discuss customers, but he did say that some radiology practices are already using the company's product. One thing is clear: his mom is certainly a fan of New Lantern.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bluesky-soars-threads-rolls-custom-174336112.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 9:43 AM","As X competitor Bluesky takes off, topping 20 million users, Meta's own Twitter-like app, Instagram Threads, has begun rolling out a new feature called custom feeds, to its global audience. Hoping to capitalize on user demand for more personalization, custom feeds are meant to allow Threads users to easily build feeds around specific topics or those including certain user profiles. This would make it easier for Threads users to tap into the communities and conversations that are most important to them and could help to challenge Bluesky's own set of tools for personalization, including those that let users build their own algorithms, feeds, and lists, as well as those that let them configure their own moderation tools. The global launch of custom feeds on Threads comes only days after Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the feature was entering testing. That signals that Threads is moving quickly to topple some of the momentum that Bluesky has recently seen. Since the U.S. elections, Bluesky adoption has soared as users looked for an alternative to the now more right-leaning X, owned by Elon Musk. Other decisions at X have also pushed people to depart, including how it has changed the block feature and its policy around training AI models on user data. As a result, Bluesky has significantly grown its user base from around 7 million users just a couple of months ago to now north of 20 million. But Threads retains the lead among the X competitors, with more than 275 million monthly users, largely thanks to its ability to jump-start its network by leveraging Instagram's social graph and integrations with Meta's other apps. However, some users on Threads have been disappointed by its decision to deprioritize politics, and have asked for other options beyond the default algorithmic ""For You"" feed and the chronological ""Following"" feed. That's where custom feeds come in. To use the feature, you’ll first need to search for and then tap into a topic to see the latest posts. From there, you’ll tap on the three-dot icon next to the search term and choose the option “create new feed.” You can also choose to add specific user profiles to a feed by visiting the user’s profile, tapping the three-dot icon above their profile photo, and then tapping to add them to one of your feeds. After the feeds are created, they can be pinned to the top of the Threads' home screen on the web in the columns-based view (similar to Twitter's Tweetdeck or X Pro), making them easier to access.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tv-time-points-apples-significant-163110920.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 2:25 PM","TV Time, a popular TV and movie tracking and recommendations app with more than 30 million registered users, disappeared from Apple's App Store for several weeks, leading to questions about its future from the app's avid fan base. Considering that 2.5 million users use the app every month to track what they're watching and to engage in a social network where they can comment on individual episodes, vote for favorite characters, post images and GIFs, and connect with other users, its disappearance didn't go unnoticed. On November 1, the company announced via a post on X that it was aware the app had been removed from the App Store and that it was ""working with Apple to get it back ASAP."" It offered no other details as to what may have caused the app to be pulled or how soon it could return. Users continually reply to that post in hopes of an update, but unfortunately for TV Time fans, several weeks passed without a resolution. After TechCrunch reached out to TV Time and Apple about the app's removal, the app was reinstated on the App Store. TV Time has long been operated by entertainment analytics platform Whip Media Group following its acquisition in 2016 of the French startup, formerly known as TVShow Time. Similar to other services like Reelgood or JustWatch, the app can direct users to where a show or movie can be streamed and can suggest other series you might like, based on your viewing activity. During the time of its removal, existing iOS users were still able to access the app on their devices, but anyone trying to install TV Time on a new iPhone or iPad would have been out of luck. In addition, the App Store removal meant TV Time was no longer able to issue updates to its app to its current user base. TechCrunch reached out to the company to find out why the app was pulled. According to Whip Media Chief Marketing Officer Jerry Inman, the dispute with Apple had to do with the mishandling of a routine intellectual property (IP) complaint. TV Time users had uploaded some TV and film cover art to the app, leading a company to claim copyrights over the app and issue a takedown notice via the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). While TV Time complies with the DMCA, it asked the complainant to provide proof of ownership -- like a copyright registration -- which it was unable to do. Despite the lack of evidence, TV Time says it still removed the images from both the TV Time platform and its metadata platform, TheTVDB. However, the complainant also demanded a financial settlement not consistent with the DMCA, so Whip Media did not agree to pay, Inman claims. ""Despite Whip Media having complied with the DMCA and explaining that to Apple, the complainant notified Apple that its claim was 'unresolved,' and Apple decided to remove TV Time from the App Store,"" he says. The company has since resolved the matter with the complainant. As of the time of writing, the TV Time app was in the process of returning to the App Store. However, Inman warns this is another case where Apple had too much power over the companies doing business on its App Store platform. ""Apple holds significant power over app developers by controlling access to a massive market and, in this case, seems to have acted on a complaint without requiring robust evidence from the complainant,"" Inman shared with TechCrunch. Apple did not offer a comment on the matter, but pointed to its App Store Content Dispute website which explains how the process of copyright or trademark claims would work. The website allows a complainant to submit a claim which then connects them with the app developer in question so the two parties can work together on solving the issue. Apple would not immediately step in to remove the app upon receiving the complaint, but it would if the two parties didn't come to a resolution through this process. (Whether Whip Media's telling of this story is correct, the parties did eventually come to an agreement of some sort as the app is now back.) While TV Time was missing from the App Store, fans could use the app on Android and the web at app.tvtime.com. According to data from app intelligence firm Appfigures, TV Time has seen 7.4 million installs on iOS to date since Appfigures' tracking system began, on January 1, 2017. (The app itself first launched in 2012.) November 20, 2024: Updated after publication with more information about the App Store Content Dispute process.

Here’s What Could Kill It Todd Rokita sent a civil investigative demand to Tyson Foods in Logansport seeking information related to human labor trafficking, his office said in a statement. While Tyson itself isn’t under formal investigation, the attorney general said the broader probe is focused on the “coordinated efforts” by nonprofits and businesses to bring “large numbers of migrants to Indiana.” The move by Rokita, a supporter of Donald Trump, offers a glimpse of how meat processors can come under more intense scrutiny if the president-elect moves forward with a major crackdown on immigrant labor. Trump has confirmed he plans to use the military to carry out what he’s vowed will be the largest mass deportation in US history. Companies such as Tyson and JBS SA rely on foreign workers for hard-to-fill jobs at its beef, chicken and pork factories across the country and have benefited from the surge in immigration during Joe Biden’s presidency. “When you have an open border and an influx of people coming over illegally by the millions, we can’t have companies incentivizing this criminal behavior by offering jobs for cheap labor,” Rokita said in the statement. “The vast number of additional people coming into our communities is alarming, and that’s just from the standpoint of seeing the staggering number of resources being put towards this fight.” While Tyson is based in Arkansas, it has a pork plant in Logansport, Indiana. The attorney general has sent similar requests for information to nonprofits including Tent Partnership for Refugees, which connects refugees to jobs and has previously worked with Tyson, and packaging company Berry Global Group. Tyson Foods must respond in writing to the questions by Dec. 4, according to the statement. The company didn’t respond to a request from Bloomberg for a comment. Tent Partnership and Berry Global also didn’t immediately respond to requests for a comment. Trump has selected South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem to lead the Department of Homeland Security and Tom Homan, the former acting head of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, to serve as his border czar. Homan was the public face of Trump’s “zero tolerance” immigration policies during the president-elect’s first term.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/werner-nuclear-verdict-case-texas-224408174.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 2:44 PM","(Editor’s note: The author of this article conducted the interview with Matthew Leffler at F3.) CHATTANOOGA, Tenn. – With oral arguments in the appeal of the landmark Werner Enterprises nuclear verdict case set to be heard by the Texas Supreme Court Dec. 3, trucking-focused attorney Matthew Leffler said at FreightWaves’ F3: Future of Freight Festival that “this is the most important case facing the trucking industry now.” In a fireside chat from the main stage Wednesday at the event in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Leffler recapped what had happened in the 2014 crash that left one child dead and another paralyzed. The facts are not in dispute, though relatively few hands went up when the audience was asked who was familiar with the case. A car carrying several people in snowy, icy weather crossed a median strip on Interstate 20 near Odessa, Texas, and collided head-on with a Werner truck. The jury ultimately put 70% of the blame on Werner, citing the fact that the relatively new driver’s trainer was asleep in the sleeper berth at the time of the collision and that there was no CB radio in the cab, among other factors. The initial, nearly $90 million verdict from 2018 has since ballooned to well over $100 million with accrued interest. Werner has said in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that its out-of-pocket exposure is capped at $10 million, a figure that is also the generally accepted definition of a nuclear verdict in trucking. “This is the most important case in our industry, because where these verdicts go is where your insurance premiums begin to rise,” Leffler said. “This is the nature of the industry. So we need to be aware of these things.” He called the case “bananas” and the argument about lacking a CB “absurd.” Leffler noted that the chief argument accepted by the jury was that given the wintry conditions, the Werner truck should have been going slower, though the truck was moving below the posted speed limit. He also seemed to implicitly criticize the strategy of Werner’s attorneys not hammering out a settlement. “One of the things you don’t do as a lawyer is take a trial when a child passes away, because you’re not going to win those verdicts,” he said. Given that the Werner (NASDAQ: WERN) truck was found to be well maintained and the truck was traveling under the speed limit – though reportedly faster than other traffic that had slowed as a result of the weather – Leffler said the message from the Werner case is, “We have to be vigilant on these things and be educated about what’s happening.” “Safely delivering freight on time and undamaged is difficult even under the best circumstances,” he said. “But they are at war with our industry, and these cases show us what’s happening.” In filings before the Texas Supreme Court, Werner’s arguments center on legal questions, not the facts of the case or the specifics of the jury findings. Leffler also skewered the $460 million-plus verdict against trailer manufacturer Wabash National earlier this year. The attorney recapped what happened in that case: An inebriated driver (whose lack of sobriety was not admissible in court) in 2019 drove at 55 mph into the back of a truck operated by a now-defunct carrier in Missouri, killing the driver and a passenger. The carrier was hauling a Wabash-manufactured trailer. The jury found Wabash (NYSE: WNC) liable, even though the rear guard complied with federal standards and the victims were not wearing seat belts. “This case should terrify every single person in this room,” Leffler said. “Not a single trailer is tested for 55-mile-per-hour rear impact,” Leffler said. “So the question becomes, if this is the standard, what do we do as motor carriers? What do we do as manufacturers? How are we going to think about trailers?” If the rear guards need to be strong enough to withstand an impact as high as 70 mph, he added, “there is no reasonable way you get to this conclusion.” The Wabash verdict is expected to go to appeal. Leffler noted that Missouri does have tort reform that on appeal could limit the penalty to $70 million, based on the formulas in the reform legislation. Wabash is a “great company,” Leffler said. According to Barchart, its current market capitalization is about $804.3 million. “They could not survive a $462 million verdict,” Leffler said. A verdict against truck manufacturer Daimler Truck North America in September involved a jury finding fault in part with the driver seat construction and the fact that Daimler (OTC: DTGHF) only offered as an option a seat that might have protected a driver from being paralyzed in a rollover with the cab’s roof being crushed. That is what happened in the Alabama case that dates back to 2022. The jury verdict in Alabama was $160 million. “So the question becomes, is a safety measure that is optional now mandatory?” Leffler said. “What will Daimler do? Does it mean that we have to make sure every single truck has every single safety feature at all times?” More articles by John Kingston State of Freight live: A bullish post-election trucking market assessment Diesel benchmark price hasn’t been this low in more than 3 years Report: Driver shortage claim ‘spurious,’ fixation on efficiency causes turnover The post Werner nuclear verdict case in Texas is hugely significant, says attorney at F3 appeared first on FreightWaves.","(Editor’s note: author of this article the interview with Matthew Leffler F3.)

The university denies the allegations. The strike by 37,000 service and patient care workers represented by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees Local 3299 comes a month after the union filed a complaint with the state’s Public Employment Relations Board alleging that the university has engaged in illegal bad faith bargaining. AFSCME Local 3299 said in its complaint that the university “illegally sidestepped bargaining to unilaterally increase healthcare costs by hundreds of dollars every month, refused to provide critical staff vacancy and financial information needed for constructive negotiations, and detailed a pattern of UC representatives repeatedly coming to bargaining sessions unprepared and without authority to negotiate.” “Filing a claim does not mean there has been a finding of wrongdoing by the university. The University disagrees wholeheartedly with their claims,” the university said in a statement. The university said it has been negotiating a new contract with AFSCME Local 3299 since January and that the union “has not responded to or acknowledged any UC proposals since May.” It said the university and the union are in the final stage of the impasse process at the Public Employment Relations Board. The university offered all employees a minimum wage of $25 an hour starting July 1, 2025, and at least a 5% pay raise, it said. The contract for patient care workers expired July 31 and the one for service workers expired October 31. “The University’s serial lawbreaking at the bargaining table means that the epidemic of understaffing at UC facilities, and the related cost of living and housing affordability crises plaguing frontline UC workers are only getting worse,” AFSCME Local 3299 President Michael Avant said in a statement. Another union representing 4,000 healthcare, research and technical workers at the University of California, San Francisco also went on strike Wednesday to demand the university address what they say are systemwide staff shortages that have resulted in overcrowded emergency rooms, longer wait times and research delays. The University Professional and Technical Employees, or UPTE, said union members at UCSF include physician assistants, pharmacists, case managers, rehabilitation specialists, mental health clinicians, clinical lab scientists, optometrists, staff research associates, language interpreters, IT workers and more. “When patient demand goes up, hospitals need more staff. The UC system may not care to prioritize patient care, but our members do and are willing to hold UC accountable,” UPTE president Dan Russell said in a statement.","FRANCISCO (AP) Thousands of University of California workers on Wednesday began a two-day strike to they say are unfair bargaining tactics by university system and staff The university denies The strike 37,000 service patient care workers represented by the American Federation of State, County Municipal Employees 3299 comes a month after the union a complaint with the Public Employment Relations Board alleging that the university has engaged illegal faith bargaining.

""We're seeing higher engagement across income cohorts with upper-income households continuing to account for the majority of our share gains,"" said Walmart Executive VP & CFO John David Rainey. Bloomberg/Getty Images According to Walmart's third-quarter earnings report for 2025, total revenues increased by 5.5% to $169.6 billion compared to the same time last year, surpassing analysts' expected $167.5 billion. Same-store sales in Walmart U.S. grew by 5.3% versus last year, exceeding analysts' predicted 3.81%. E-commerce sales were up 43% internationally and increased by a shocking 22% in Walmart U.S., surpassing analysts' low estimates of 2.22%. Related: Walmart says this Trump trade policy could lead to higher prices According to Walmart, efficient pick-up and delivery services led to this massive growth, along with a 50% increase in overall advertising business and innovative marketplace strategies. The company attributed its profitable sales to its grocery category, which grew to the highest level in four years and comprised 60% of Walmart's U.S. sales. Walmart reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.58, outdoing analysts' expectations of $0.53. Although Walmart has been on cloud nine after reporting outstanding earnings, one of its competitors is not doing as well. Like Walmart, Target has an online presence and a physical shopping experience with pick-up and delivery options. The retailer has also begun reducing prices on various items and focusing on providing a more affordable shopping experience. However, all its efforts have not been as successful as Walmart's, as Target's third-quarter earnings completely missed analysts' expectations while reporting multiple declines. Target's net sales are still up 1.1% yearly to $25.70 billion, almost matching analysts' expected $25.74 billion, and its same-store sales declined 1.9%. EPS declined 11.9% to $1.85, missing analysts' estimated $2.30. These unfavorable results caused its shares to drop over 21% during Wednesday's opening market hours.

However, their different approaches to providing value made the difference between them. ""While Target has reduced prices on everyday essentials, Walmart’s price rollbacks and assortment updates in general merchandise... seem to have resonated more with consumers this past quarter,"" said Hottovy. As for its fourth-quarter outlook, Target  (TGT)  kept numbers below analysts' predicted guidance, expecting flat comparable sales and EPS of $1.85 to $2.45, below analysts' expected $2.65. Although Walmart  (WMT)  warned investors that Trump's trade policy could lead to higher prices and potentially hurt its business, the outstanding growth reported in its third-quarter earnings made Walmart optimistic about its continuous growth, causing the company to raise its guidance for fiscal 2025. Walmart now expects net sales to grow around 4.8% to 5.1% compared to its last guidance increase of 3.75% to 4.75%.

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting NYC Mayor Adams Names Jessica Tisch to Lead Police Head Amid Probes The package will include ¥13.9 trillion earmarked for spending from the general account, NHK said. The size is fractionally larger than last year’s ¥21.8 trillion fiscal spending package. Together with private sector spending, the impact of the package overall is expected to be around ¥39 trillion, NHK said. The proposed plan is expected to be approved by the cabinet Friday, following Ishiba’s return from South America where he attended a series of summit meetings. While Ishiba was under political pressure to promise a hefty package of aid ahead of last month’s general election, the set of measures will add to the largest debt load for a developed economy. The package is set to include support for sustained wage gains and cash handouts for low-income households, as well as investment into the semiconductor and artificial intelligence sector, according to an earlier draft of the plan seen by Bloomberg. The government also said it will resume subsidies for gas and electricity bills from January, to protect households from higher commodity prices. Ishiba’s minority government has needed to make concessions to the smaller Democratic Party for the People to ensure funding for the package will get passed in parliament. The package will state that annual tax reform discussions for the next fiscal year will include raising the ceiling for tax-free income from ¥1.03 million ($6,650), as proposed by the DPP, and will mention discussions on cutting gasoline taxes, an initiative also proposed by the DPP, the party said Wednesday. --With assistance from Go Onomitsu and Ryotaro Nakamaru.

Hailer. Raveendran allegedly recruited Hailer, who is a former political consultant, to try to buy out US creditors owed more than $1.2 billion under a loan, according to the filing with the US Bankruptcy Court in Delaware. Raveendran could then swap that debt, which was trading at about 0.24 cents on the dollar as of Wednesday evening, for ownership of Epic!, a education-software firm. The plan ultimately failed. “Over the last several months I have been used as a pawn in Byju’s manipulation of the law,” Hailer wrote in his testimony. Hailer is set to testify in federal court on Thursday on behalf of a trustee, which is planning to sell Epic! in order to raise money for Byju’s creditors, including US lenders. A representative of Byju’s and a lawyer for Raveendran did not return requests for comment. Raveendran has denied wrongdoing in past responses to lender allegations, saying his actions were a justified response to overly aggressive tactics used by creditors who specialize in squeezing money out of distressed companies. This summer, when Hailer began negotiating with lenders, Raveendran wired $11.25 million to a company that Hailer ran called Rose Lake Inc. Hailer was supposed to use the cash to prove to lenders that he was well funded. The money was then to be returned to Raveendran, Hailer said. The money came from OCI Ltd., a UK-incorporated logistics firm that received hundreds of millions of dollars in loan proceeds that US lenders have been trying to reclaim, according Hailer’s court filing. Hailer said he tried unsuccessfully to gather proof that OCI was still holding money on behalf of Byju’s, even though Raveendran has claimed all the cash has been spent. For several months, Hailer said he regularly spoke with Raveendran and other Indian business people involved in the Byju’s empire. Hailer also visited Raveendran’s family compound in Dubai for talks with investors who were allegedly backing Raveendran’s effort to regain control of Byju’s. Lenders have been fighting Byju’s in both US state and federal courts for more than a year. Lenders claim Raveendran hid $533 million in loan proceeds that should have been repaid to creditors.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apollo-faces-ceo-golden-moment-010059132.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 5:00 PM","(Bloomberg) -- Apollo Global Management Inc. Chief Executive Officer Marc Rowan’s potential next act as US Treasury secretary would thrust the firm he co-founded into an entirely new era of leadership. It may also help unlock trillions of dollars for its hottest business line. Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting NYC Mayor Adams Names Jessica Tisch to Lead Police Head Amid Probes In the roughly three years since co-founders Leon Black and Josh Harris left the company, Rowan has helped transform Apollo from a feared distressed-debt investor into a buzzy, money-spinning lending machine that rivals Wall Street’s banks. He also ushered in an era of stability and prosperity after a tumultuous power struggle. During his tenure, assets have soared to $733 billion, and its stock has more than tripled. “We actually outgrew Apple, we outgrew Microsoft, we outgrew almost every growth company you could think of,” Rowan said at the firm’s trajectory since the financial crisis at an investor day last month. If selected, Rowan’s exit would trigger a leadership change that would put a non-founder in charge for the first time in its 34-year history. But Rowan would move into a position with the sway to open up private markets to a broader range of investors. That could supercharge growth of both Apollo and the booming $1.6 trillion private credit market, which has attracted investors seeking higher returns but also faced questions over transparency and complexity. Rowan, who interviewed with President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday, is one of several candidates auditioning for the role. Others include former Soros Fund Management investor and hedge fund founder Scott Bessent, former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh and US Senator Bill Hagerty, a Tennessee Republican. Rowan — a 62-year-old who’s been dubbed The Professor for his didactic approach that contrasts with the typical private equity bravado — has said he views the push of private assets into retirement accounts not just as a business opportunity but a crucial fix to a looming issue for the US. “We as a society have done a terrible job planning for retirement,” Rowan said at the event last month. He pointed to how 401(k)s are reliant on S&P 500 index funds and particularly the gains from a few tech giants. “I jokingly say sometimes we levered the entire retirement of America to Nvidia’s performance. It just doesn’t seem smart.” Rowan reshaped the firm with an early bet, founding an insurance company that provides stable capital for Apollo to invest. The move has been copied across the industry in recent years. At the investor day, he presented a slide depicting Apollo as a spaceship that had reached the moon, surrounded by planets representing growth opportunities, including a $45 trillion market of retirement assets. He also carefully cultivated a select group of leaders who can someday take over. They include Co-Presidents Scott Kleinman and Jim Zelter, the president of Apollo’s Athene insurance arm and a bench of younger managers the company recently elevated. Any transition would be subject to board approval, and it’s not yet clear how soon a leadership transition would occur. Inside Apollo, as employees waited for word from Florida, they seemed optimistic at the prospect of their CEO being chosen, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Shareholders were less assured, with the stock sliding 3.2% on Wednesday, the most since early September. Potential CEOs Rowan took over Apollo in 2021 after a bruising succession battle. Black resigned following scrutiny over payments he made to now-deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, and a spat between Black and Harris over the firm’s leadership spilled into public view. Apollo, with its roots in Michael Milken’s notorious junk-bond shop Drexel Burnham Lambert, built its name as the scrappiest private equity and distressed-debt investor on Wall Street by buying businesses and loading them up with debt that offered creditors meager protections in the face of default. On the investing side, it offered loans to risky businesses that couldn’t get bank financing, then regularly went head-to-head with other creditors when those companies went bankrupt. But as rates crept up, those businesses and practices became less lucrative for the vast resources they required. In a bid to embark on an ambitious and much simpler growth plan, Rowan created a life insurance business that has become a cash cow and growth driver. Apollo’s credit business, now its largest at $598 billion, originates the loans for Athene. The firm septupled its revenue over the past 15 years as low interest rates and banks in retreat after the financial crisis drove more capital its way. “It’s important to ask the question publicly that we ask the team: Were we lucky or smart?” Rowan said last month. “We were lucky. We were smart only in that we positioned the business in front of incredible tailwinds.” He made clear the coming period will be different, predicting “the tailwinds that got us here are not here anymore.” Still, he’s trying to double assets to $1.5 trillion over the next five years. Retail and private wealth clients are expected to drive some of that growth. Kleinman, who has typically overseen the firm’s private equity businesses, joined Apollo in 1996, six years after it was founded. Zelter leads its credit business. He arrived in 2006 and grew its credit unit, which has accounted for the majority of the firm’s managed assets in recent years. Zelter is respected as the architect and driver of the firm’s biggest business, while Kleinman has more private equity experience and the advantage of being younger, according to people close to the firm. Meanwhile, Deputy Chief Investment Officer John Zito has been touted as heir apparent to the credit business, which houses the insurance and real estate debt business and teams. He was part of a group the firm highlighted among its next generation of leaders, along with co-heads of equity Matt Nord and David Sambur and Athene President Grant Kvalheim. Last year, that foursome received new compensation agreements that granted them the bulk of $557 million of special stock awards aimed at giving leaders more skin in the game. Private Jet If Rowan joins the Treasury, he’ll face another arduous task: untangling himself from the investing behemoth. He has invested more than $100 million in the firm’s funds and products in the past four years, while an entity he controls bought about $10 million of loans the firm syndicated last year. He typically receives eight-figure annual payments from being part of a group of firm partners that get a cut of Apollo’s tax savings related to a taxable share exchange a few years ago. Rowan is the fourth-largest Apollo shareholder, with a stake of about 6% that’s worth almost $6 billion, according to public filings. That excludes his stakes in Apollo’s funds. If he serves as Treasury secretary, he would likely have to divest his equity stake in the company. Much like Apollo’s fundraising efforts in recent years, its shares have been on a tear, soaring to an all-time high this month after the firm posted strong third-quarter results. The record volumes of loans it originated this year, as well as an increase in wealthy clients, helped push its market value to $92 billion. Joining the government can offer a big tax advantage to Wall Street bosses who have built up significant stakes in their firms. To avoid potential conflicts of interest, US laws let incoming officials sell their stock in former employers and defer tax payments, as long as they move the proceeds into plain-vanilla investments such as government securities or certain mutual funds. That can be valuable, letting appointees diversify a heavily concentrated portfolio and continue growing it before cutting off a piece for the Internal Revenue Service. Apollo, meanwhile, would need to find a new method of transportation: The firm pays an hourly rate to use Rowan’s private jet. --With assistance from Peter Eichenbaum.

Rosenworcel, who joined the FCC in 2012 and is the first female permanent chair, oversaw a dramatic expansion of commission work on space policy including the establishment of a Space Bureau. She was also behind efforts to help more students get internet access, oversaw a government subsidy program to help 23 million households get broadband access and led an agency crackdown on the proliferation of Chinese telecoms equipment and other national security issues. Rosenworcel said the job had been the honor of a lifetime, guiding ""the FCC during a time when communications technology is a part of every aspect of civic and commercial life."" She led efforts to restore landmark net neutrality rules that were reversed by the FCC under then President Donald Trump and have since been put on hold by a court. Net neutrality rules require internet service providers to treat internet data and users equally rather than restricting access, slowing speeds or blocking content for certain users. A federal appeals court in August blocked the FCC from enforcing the rules while an industry legal challenge plays out. Rosenworcel is following long-standing commission precedent by stepping down when a new president takes office, which will leave the commission divided 2-2 between Democratic and Republican appointees. This week, Trump named FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr, a critic of the Biden administration's telecom policies and Big Tech, as new chair effective Jan. 20. Trump will need to nominate a replacement for Rosenworcel and win Senate confirmation before Republicans can take full control of the agency. Rosenworcel was hampered by the fact that the U.S. Senate did not confirm a third Democratic FCC commissioner until September 2023, which prevented the commission from moving ahead on many fronts. She clashed with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk when the FCC in 2022 rescinded $885.5 million in rural broadband subsidies for SpaceX's internet satellite constellation Starlink.

All-solid-state batteries, replacing liquid-state lithium-ion batteries, will produce twice the driving range by the end of this decade and over 2.5 times more by the 2040s, said Keiji Otsu, president of Honda R&D. Automakers and battery suppliers worldwide have unveiled plans to develop solid-state batteries, touted as a key technology to make longer-lasting, safer and cheaper electric vehicles amid slowing EV growth. ""It's a game-changer of the EV era,"" Otsu told reporters at Honda's pilot all-solid-state battery production line in Tochigi north of Tokyo. Honda is investing 43 billion yen ($277 million) in the pilot line, nearly half of which is funded with Japanese government subsidies. Honda will start operating the pilot line in January, with goals also to reduce battery size by 50%, weight by 35% and cost by 25% from current levels in the next half decade, Otsu said. Honda plans to increase its annual EV production to over 2 million units by 2030. It also targets a global sales ratio of 40% for EVs and fuel cell vehicles in 2030, and 100% in 2040. Nissan Motor, Honda's strategic partner, is also developing all-solid-state batteries, aiming to start the operation of its pilot line in March.

Honda has ""no reason to refuse"" the external sale of its solid-state batteries if that is mutually beneficial to it and partners, Otsu added.

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting NYC Mayor Adams Names Jessica Tisch to Lead Police Head Amid Probes The White House will cancel half of a $9 billion loan delivered to Ukraine as part of a $60 billion supplemental package approved in April. The loan idea was first floated by Trump during the campaign and was a key tweak to the legislation made by House Republican leaders, though the administration had always signaled a part of it would be forgiven. Canceling the debt, “thereby helping Ukraine prevail, is in the national interest of the United States and its EU, G7+, and NATO partners,” the State Department said in a letter to Congress dated Nov. 18. The move is part of a broader effort by President Joe Biden to rush more support to Kyiv before Trump returns to the White House in January. He has said his priority is pushing Russia and Ukraine toward peace negotiations, and Kyiv’s supporters fear he may cut off aid as part of that push. In recent days Biden agreed to allow Ukraine to use US-provided long-range missiles to strike targets deep inside Russia. On Wednesday, the administration announced a new security assistance package worth $275 million, including anti-personnel land mines. QuickTake: Why US Now Lets Ukraine Hit Russia With Its Missiles: QuickTake The State Department didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The plan drew objections from Republicans. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky said in a post on X Wednesday that he would seek to force a vote on the Senate floor to “stop the Biden Administration from making Ukraine’s debt the responsibility of the American people.” Both houses of Congress would need to approve Paul’s resolution, something that’s unlikely to happen given that Democrats control the Senate. Biden could also veto the resolution if it were to pass. A US official said Wednesday evening that Biden was within his rights to cancel 50% of the debt. In a trip to Brussels intended to reassure allies days after the election, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the Biden administration was committed to ensuring “every dollar we have at our disposal” is pushed out to Ukraine. The loan is separate from the nearly $9 billion left in weapons assistance the administration has pledged to spend by the end of Biden’s term. About $7 billion of that money must be spent primarily on arms supplies from US stocks, a challenging task as the Pentagon’s supplies of some key missiles and other systems are already running low. The rest of the funding is set to go toward defense production contracts that will ship supplies directly to Ukraine once they’re ready. The Trump administration could choose to cancel some of those contracts at a cost if they chose to do so. --With assistance from Viktoria Dendrinou and Courtney McBride.

After stalling for three sessions, the greenback was back on the march higher, with investors lifting the dollar index measure against its key rivals closer to a one-year high of 107.07 hit last week. The dollar has rallied more than 2% since the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election on bets Trump's policies could reignite inflation and temper the Fed's future rate cuts. At the same time, traders are sizing up what Trump's campaign pledges of tariffs mean for the rest of the world, with Europe and China both likely on the firing line. ""It's hard to short the USD right now,"" given that investors are also increasingly weighing the possibility that the Fed might not cut rates next month after all, said senior market analyst Matt Simpson at City Index. That sentiment was driven by sharp swings in market pricing, which currently sets the odds of a Fed rate cut at its December meeting at just under 54%, down from 82.5% just a week ago, according to CME's FedWatch Tool. A Reuters poll showed most economists expect the Fed to cut rates at its December meeting, with shallower cuts in 2025 than expected a month ago due to the risk of higher inflation from Trump's policies. Separate comments from two Fed governors Michelle Bowman and Lisa Cook on Wednesday gave little clarity about the Fed's path forward, with one citing ongoing concerns about inflation and another expressing confidence that price pressures will continue to ease. The dollar index held steady at 106.56, up from a one-week nadir hit in the previous session. The euro was nearly flat at $1.054725 after slipping 0.5% on Wednesday, back toward last week's low of $1.0496, its weakest against the dollar since Oct. 2023. ""The Russia-Ukraine conflict is heating up, which is further denting sentiment towards the euro alongside the prospects of trade tariffs,"" another ""bullish cue"" for the dollar index given the euro's heavy weighting, City Index's Simpson said. Ukraine fired a volley of British Storm Shadow cruise missiles into Russia on Wednesday, the latest new Western weapon it has been permitted to use on Russian targets a day after it fired U.S. ATACMS missiles. The dollar gave up some gains against the yen, down 0.33% at 154.91 yen, although the Japanese currency remained under pressure. The currency pair rose above the 156 mark last week for the first time since July, stirring worries that Japanese authorities may again take steps to shore up the yen. The focus will be on Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda, who is scheduled to speak at a financial forum in Paris on Thursday after leaving the door open for a December rate hike in balanced remarks at the start of the week. Investors will be looking for any stronger indication that a year-end rate hike is in the cards, with market pricing nearly evenly split amid the yen's recent decline back toward the 38-year-lows touched in July. Sterling was up 0.07% at $1.2656. Data on Wednesday showed British inflation jumped more than expected last month to rise back above the Bank of England's 2% target, supporting the central bank's cautious approach on interest rate cuts.

The price tag of the traditional holiday meal, which also includes cranberries, sweet potatoes and stuffing, has dropped for a second consecutive year, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation's annual survey released on Wednesday. Cooks can thank the bird. Turkey prices dropped 6% on cooling demand as some consumers opted to add beef and pork to the menu, the Farm Bureau and market analysts said. Still, the meal's price tag will cost families about 19% more than pre-pandemic times, the Farm Bureau said. Frustration over high prices was seen as a major factor in Donald Trump's presidential election victory over Kamala Harris, but the Farm Bureau data suggests some of the worst inflation has abated. ""We are seeing modest improvements in the cost of a Thanksgiving dinner for a second year, but America's families, including farm families, are still being hurt by high inflation,"" said Farm Bureau President Zippy Duvall. CHEAPER MEAL The average cost for a 10-person meal came to $58.08, down from $61.17 last year and a record $64.05 in 2022, Farm Bureau data showed. The price of a turkey, which represents the bulk of the bill, fell even as supplies dropped 6% in 2024 partly because of a bird-flu outbreak. Turkey demand of 13.9 pounds per person in 2024 is down nearly a pound from 2023, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. Like most grocery items, turkey prices rose alongside overall inflation in recent years, which may have spooked consumers in 2024, said Ashley Kohls, the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association's executive director. ""We're working on bringing folks back to purchasing turkey after a number of years of having elevated prices at the grocery store,"" said Kohls. Indiana turkey farmer Greg Gunthorp said his customers appear to have plenty of supply to meet consumer demand this year. There have been far fewer frantic calls from buyers scrambling to restock, he said. ""We've had those outlier years when there just aren't enough turkeys to go around and our phones are just ringing off the hook. This is definitely not one of those years,"" Gunthorp said. ""I think lots of people are adding items to the menu in addition to the turkey, things like brisket and ham."" The Farm Bureau survey found that the price of other ingredients in the Thanksgiving meal also fell, including the cost of fresh vegetables and whole milk, although the price of processed ingredients, such as dinner rolls and cubed stuffing, increased.

Gasoline inventories last week rose more than forecast, while distillate stockpiles posted a larger-than-expected draw.

Maybe that sounds obvious, but these scaling laws were a key factor in developing ChatGPT, making it better, and likely influencing many CEOs to make bold predictions about AGI arriving in just a few years. OpenAI and Safe Super Intelligence co-founder Ilya Sutskever told Reuters last week that ""everyone is looking for the next thing"" to scale their AI models. Earlier this month, a16z co-founder Marc Andreessen said in a podcast that AI models currently seem to be converging at the same ceiling on capabilities. But now, almost immediately after these concerning trends started to emerge, AI CEOs, researchers, and investors are already declaring we're in a new era of scaling laws. ""Test-time compute,"" which gives AI models more time and compute to ""think"" before answering a question, is an especially promising contender to be the next big thing. ""We are seeing the emergence of a new scaling law,"" said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella onstage at Microsoft Ignite on Tuesday, referring to the test-time compute research underpinning OpenAI's o1 model. He's not the only one now pointing to o1 as the future. ""We're now in the second era of scaling laws, which is test-time scaling,"" said Andreessen Horowitz partner Anjney Midha, who also sits on the board of Mistral and was an angel investor in Anthropic, in a recent interview with TechCrunch. If the unexpected success – and now, the sudden slowing – of the previous AI scaling laws tell us anything, it's that it is very hard to predict how and when AI models will improve. Regardless, there seems to be a paradigm shift underway: the ways AI labs try to advance their models for the next five years likely won't resemble the last five. The rapid AI model improvements that OpenAI, Google, Meta, and Anthropic have achieved since 2020 can largely be attributed to one key insight: use more compute and more data during an AI model's pretraining phase. When researchers give machine learning systems abundant resources during this phase – in which AI identifies and stores patterns in large datasets – models have tended to perform better at predicting the next word or phrase. This first generation of AI scaling laws pushed the envelope of what computers could do, as engineers increased the number of GPUs used and the quantity of data they were fed. Even if this particular method has run its course, it has already redrawn the map. Every Big Tech company has basically gone all in on AI, while Nvidia, which supplies the GPUs all these companies train their models on, is now the most valuable publicly traded company in the world. But these investments were also made with the expectation that scaling would continue as expected. It's important to note that scaling laws are not laws of nature, physics, math, or government. They're not guaranteed by anything, or anyone, to continue at the same pace. Even Moore's Law, another famous scaling law, eventually petered out — though it certainly had a longer run. ""If you just put in more compute, you put in more data, you make the model bigger – there are diminishing returns,"" said Anyscale co-founder and former CEO Robert Nishihara in an interview with TechCrunch. ""In order to keep the scaling laws going, in order to keep the rate of progress increasing, we also need new ideas."" Nishihara is quite familiar with AI scaling laws. Anyscale reached a billion-dollar valuation by developing software that helps OpenAI and other AI model developers scale their AI training workloads to tens of thousands of GPUs. Anyscale has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of pretraining scaling laws around compute, but even its cofounder recognizes that the season is changing. ""When you've read a million reviews on Yelp, maybe the next reviews on Yelp don't give you that much,"" said Nishihara, referring to the limitations of scaling data. ""But that's pretraining. The methodology around post-training, I would say, is quite immature and has a lot of room left to improve."" To be clear, AI model developers will likely continue chasing after larger compute cluster and bigger datasets for pretraining, and there's probably more improvement to eke out of those methods. Elon Musk recently finished building a supercomputer with 100,000 GPUs, dubbed Colossus, to train xAI's next models. There will be more, and larger, clusters to come. But trends suggest exponential growth is not possible by simply using more GPUs with existing strategies, so new methods are suddenly getting more attention. When OpenAI released a preview of its o1 model, the startup announced it was part of a new series of models separate from GPT. OpenAI improved its GPT models largely through traditional scaling laws: more data, more power during pretraining. But now that method reportedly isn't gaining them much. The o1 framework of models relies on a new concept, test-time compute, so called because the computing resources are used after a prompt, not before. The technique hasn't been explored much yet in the context of neural networks, but is already showing promise. Some are already pointing to test-time compute as the next method to scale AI systems. ""A number of experiments are showing that even though pretraining scaling laws may be slowing, the test-time scaling laws – where you give the model more compute at inference – can give increasing gains in performance,"" said a16z's Midha. ""OpenAI’s new 'o' series pushes [chain-of-thought] further, and requires far more computing resources, and therefore energy, to do so,"" said famed AI researcher Yoshua Bengio in an op-ed on Tuesday. ""We thus see a new form of computational scaling appear. Not just more training data and larger models but more time spent 'thinking' about answers."" Over a period of 10 to 30 seconds, OpenAI's o1 model re-prompts itself several times, breaking down a large problem into a series of smaller ones. Despite ChatGPT saying it is ""thinking,"" it isn't doing what humans do — although our internal problem-solving methods, which benefit from clear restatement of a problem and stepwise solutions, were key inspirations for the method. A decade or so back, Noam Brown, who now leads OpenAI's work on o1, was trying to build AI systems that could beat humans at poker. During a recent talk, Brown says he noticed at the time how human poker players took time to consider different scenarios before playing a hand. In 2017, he introduced a method to let a model ""think"" for 30 seconds before playing. In that time, the AI was playing different subgames, figuring out how different scenarios would play out to determine the best move. Ultimately, the AI performed seven times better than his past attempts. Granted, Brown's research in 2017 did not use neural networks, which weren't as popular at the time. However, MIT researchers released a paper last week showing that test-time compute significantly improves an AI model's performance on reasoning tasks. It's not immediately clear how test-time compute would scale. It could mean that AI systems need a really long time to think about hard questions; maybe hours or even days. Another approach could be letting an AI model ""think"" through a questions on lots of chips simultaneously. If test-time compute does take off as the next place to scale AI systems, Midha says the demand for AI chips that specialize in high-speed inference could go up dramatically. This could be good news for startups such as Groq or Cerebras, that specialize in fast AI inference chips. If finding the answer is just as compute-heavy as training the model, the ""pick and shovel"" providers in AI win again. Most of the AI world doesn't seem to be losing their cool about these old scaling laws slowing down. Even if test-time compute does not prove to be the next wave of scaling, some feel we're only scratching the surface of applications for current AI models. New popular products could buy AI model developers some time to figure out new ways to improve the underlying models. ""I'm completely convinced we're going to see at least 10 to 20x gains in model performance just through pure application-level work, just allowing the models to shine through intelligent prompting, UX decisions, and passing context at the right time into the models,"" said Midha. For example, ChatGPT's Advanced Voice Mode is one the more impressive applications from current AI models. However, that was largely an innovation in user experience, not necessarily the underlying tech. You can see how further UX innovations, such as giving that feature access to the web or applications on your phone, would make the product that much better. Kian Katanforoosh, the CEO of AI startup Workera and a Stanford adjunct lecturer on deep learning, tells TechCrunch that companies building AI applications, like his, don't necessarily need exponentially smarter models to build better products. He also says the products around current models have a lot of room to get better. ""Let's say you build AI applications and your AI hallucinates on a specific task,"" said Katanforoosh. ""There are two ways that you can avoid that. Either the LLM has to get better and it will stop hallucinating, or the tooling around it has to get better and you'll have opportunities to fix the issue."" Whatever the case is for the frontier of AI research, users probably won't feel the effects of these shifts for some time. That said, AI labs will do whatever is necessary to continue shipping bigger, smarter, and faster models at the same rapid pace. That means several leading tech companies could now pivot how they're pushing the boundaries of AI. TechCrunch has an AI-focused newsletter! Sign up here to get it in your inbox every Wednesday.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidias-supply-snags-hurting-deliveries-021326703.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 6:13 PM","By Stephen Nellis and Aditya Soni SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Nvidia's revenue forecast on Wednesday disappointed Wall Street, raising questions over whether the artificial intelligence boom is waning. But the answer, according to Nvidia executives, analysts and investors, is a resounding no. There is no shortage of companies eager to create new AI systems using Nvidia's superior chips, and the world's largest publicly listed company is selling them as fast as its chipmaking contractor Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co can make them. Nvidia forecast its slowest revenue growth in seven quarters on Wednesday, pushing its stock down 2.5% after hours, and said supply chain constraints would lead to demand for its chips exceeding supply for several quarters in fiscal 2026. Making these chips is hard, and a flaw that was found in one of its chips over the summer is not helping. Nvidia's new flagship chip, named Blackwell, is actually made up of multiple chips that have to be glued together in a complex process the chip industry calls advanced packaging. While TSMC is racing to expand capacity, packaging remains a bottleneck for Nvidia and other chip companies. ""Blackwell adds more advanced packaging from TSMC than prior chips, which adds a wrinkle,"" said Ben Bajarin, CEO and principal analyst at research firm Creative Strategies. He expects Nvidia will have more demand than it can supply for all of 2025. Missteps by Nvidia have exacerbated the issues. The design flaw in Blackwell forced Nvidia to undertake what it calls a ""mask change."" CEO Jensen Huang said the flaw, which has since been fixed, lowered Blackwell chip yields, which are the proportion of chips that come off the manufacturing line fully functional. While Nvidia never elaborated on the flaw, complex chips like Blackwell can take months to produce because they require hundreds of manufacturing steps. Many of these steps involve shining ultraviolet light through a series of complex masks to project the image of a chip's circuits on a disc of silicon - a process akin to printing the chip. The mask change appears to have set back Nvidia's production timelines and cost it money, analysts said. ""There's the risk that the bottlenecks worsen rather than improve, and that could damage revenue projections,"" said Michael Schulman, chief investment officer at Running Point Capital. During a conference call with investors, Nvidia executives said the company has shipped about 13,000 samples of its new chip and expects to beat its initial estimates that it would sell several billion dollars' worth this quarter. ""We're at the beginning of our production ramp, which always comes with opportunities for yield improvement,"" Huang told Reuters on Wednesday. ""We are ramping Blackwell from zero to something extremely large. By definition, the laws of physics would say that there's a limit to how fast you can ramp."" In the short term, the production ramp-up is expected to pressure gross margins. Nvidia executives warned investors the company's margins would sink several percentage points to the low-70% range until production kinks are ironed out. Hendi Susanto, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, which holds Nvidia shares, said there was no doubt that demand for the company's chips remained ""absolutely and exceptionally strong"" for the foreseeable future. ""The key focus is supply - how much supply Nvidia can produce,"" he said.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-traders-brace-potential-300-144244194.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 10:52 AM","(Bloomberg) -- With Nvidia Corp. due to report an unusually complex quarter as the world’s most valuable company, traders are preparing for a potentially mammoth stock swing. Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting NYC Mayor Adams Names Jessica Tisch to Lead Police Head Amid Probes The options-implied move for Nvidia shares the day after earnings is about 8% in either direction, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That would equate to close to a $300 billion swing in market value — bigger than all but 25 companies in the S&P 500 Index. And according to strategists at Bank of America, the report carries more risk for the benchmark than the next Federal Reserve meeting or inflation data. As the poster child of the artificial intelligence trade, Nvidia’s stock has rallied nearly 200% so far in 2024 and its reports have been the biggest event on the earnings calendar for more than a year. The shares fell 1.9% on Wednesday ahead of the chipmaker’s fiscal third quarter earnings, due after markets close, and there’s more uncertainty than normal about how the results and guidance will play out. That’s because there are varying views on Wall Street about what to expect from the company’s newest product line, Blackwell. Nvidia has said that the new chips will contribute several billion dollars in revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter, while Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang described demand for the chips as “insane.” But production delays have made modeling supply — a notoriously difficult task — even harder. “There’s a big unknown around Blackwell capacity,” said Dan Eye, chief investment officer at Fort Pitt Capital Group. “The CEO has established a lot of credibility, but the bar is very high,” he said, adding that it will likely be challenging for Nvidia to give blowout guidance for next quarter. The questions around Blackwell have led to a wide spread in analyst expectations for the fiscal fourth quarter that ends in January. Consensus is at $37.1 billion — with the gap between the highest and lowest projections at more than $7 billion, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Nvidia typically provides revenue guidance for the upcoming quarter with its results. Part of the reason for the gap in analyst forecasts is that some expect customers to delay purchases of Blackwell’s predecessor products, called Hopper, in anticipation of the newer chips. That’s what Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore is anticipating and why he’s calling Wednesday’s results a “transitional” quarter. Nvidia is likely to give a conservative forecast that’s only slightly ahead of the average analyst estimate, which should satisfy most investors as long as everything points to a very strong full-year Blackwell ramp, Moore wrote. Jim Worden, chief investment officer of Wealth Consulting Group, is also less concerned about the timing of Blackwell, with all signs pointing to strong demand. “I expect we’ll see a very good showing with Blackwell and how much it is shipping,” he said. “That trend should continue on into next year.” The chipmaker’s biggest customers, including Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc., all pledged in their most recent results to pump more into capital spending in the year ahead. However, with a history of beating estimates in a big way, thanks to unbridled demand for its accelerator chips, Nvidia may need to do more than provide assurances that Blackwell’s ramp up remains strong. In the past five quarters, Nvidia sales have beaten consensus by an average of about $1.8 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. If Nvidia results fall short of that bar, it could spell trouble for the stock, which is trading close to a record high. “The stock could be volatile, even on a really good report,” Worden said. The market may be expecting perfection, “and to the extent it isn’t perfect, the stock could pull back.” Rick Bensignor, chief executive officer of Bensignor Investment Strategies and a former Morgan Stanley strategist, agrees. “It can’t just beat the consensus, but also the whisper-type numbers that people are looking for,” he said. “If it disappoints, we can easily see it come off 10% or so.” For the broader market, the implications of Nvidia’s results might not have been fully priced in, said Charlie McElligott, Nomura’s cross asset strategist at Nomura. Option straddles on the Invesco Nasdaq 100 ETF are only implying a 1.7% move for Thursday. “That maybe ‘feels’ light,” McElligott wrote.

SpaceX achieved new feats during the sixth major test launch of its Starship system but nixed an eagerly anticipated midair “catch” of the rocket’s booster as President-elect Donald Trump looked on in South Texas.

Part of the money will be spent on payments directly to Google, though the majority will be spent on in-house efforts that leverage Google's products, Steve Chase, vice chair of AI and innovation for KPMG, told Reuters in an interview. That includes developing AI agents and training the firm's workforce to become proficient with the technology. While Wall Street waits on the technology industry to demonstrate returns commensurate with the billions in capital expenditure it is pouring into AI, professional services providers have become one of the first business beneficiaries of the technology as large businesses tap accounting and consulting firms for help on implementing AI inside their companies and product offerings. ""We strongly are in the camp that it is moving from [proof of concept] and experimentation to scaling,"" Chase said. ""We believe that professional services is going through the largest transformation that it will likely ever go through."" He cited a KPMG poll of business leaders, which found that about 50% of surveyed organizations planned to spend $100 million on AI initiatives over the next 12 months, and about 20% planned to spend at least $250 million. Bookings for KPMG's Google Cloud-related services have grown 10-fold over the last two years, Chase said. In keeping with clients' demands, KPMG is spreading its bets across cloud providers. In July 2023, the firm announced a $2 billion commitment across five years to expand AI and cloud services via Microsoft. Google's president of revenue for its cloud division, Matt Renner, told Reuters the company is emphasizing partnering with consulting firms as part of its cloud growth strategy. The company's third-quarter earnings beat in October was driven in part by a 35% boost in cloud sales. Renner predicted that the three major cloud companies — Amazon, Microsoft and Google — and most professional services firms would continue to ""grow pretty exponentially together.""

The mainland stock has outperformed SMIC’s Hong Kong shares by almost 50 percentage points, underscoring stronger demand from onshore Chinese investors. Expectations for Donald Trump’s presidency have pumped up shares of SMIC and local peers as beneficiaries of China’s drive to localize manufacturing. Some analysts and fund managers caution that the stocks now look expensive, while China’s chip industry faces ongoing issues of economic malaise and restricted access to crucial technologies. “There is a lot of speculative buying and the trading is based on news events instead of fundamentals,” so volatility should be expected, said Xiang Xiaotian, a director at Shanghai Chengzhou Investment Management Co. “The main trading thesis is domestic substitution as Chinese companies will need to turn to local chipmakers.” China has been outspending other nations on chips as it struggles to narrow the wide technology gap with Western nations. Expected benefits from Beijing’s latest pledges of stimulus have served as an additional catalyst for SMIC and domestic peers including Hua Hong Semiconductor Ltd., whose onshore shares are up 78% from their September low. SMIC forecast higher-than-expected sales growth for this quarter as its competitive prices lured local chip designers, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. More broadly, China foundries “bottomed out earlier” than other global manufacturers of less-advanced chips, Counterpoint Research wrote in a note in August. Even if demand for these so-called legacy semiconductors used in auto and industrial applications improves, however, China remains far behind in AI and other advanced areas due to US-led restrictions that prevent it from acquiring the most advanced manufacturing equipment. For example, Huawei Technologies Co.’s ambitions to create more powerful chips have hit major snags because of US sanctions, people familiar with the matter said. “Artificial intelligence is a small blessing for SMIC and Hua Hong,” Morningstar Inc. analyst Phelix Lee wrote in a report. The pair may not be moving quickly enough to capture demand for high-end power chips used in data centers, he said, adding that if Chinese AI startups lose access to advanced processors that would also hurt demand for peripheral chips supplied by SMIC and Hua Hong. Meanwhile, SMIC’s outsized share-price gain is likely to drive increased scrutiny of its earnings and other metrics. Some observers also note the potential for rivals such as TSMC to lower prices for making legacy chips, putting pressure on SMIC’s pricing power. “We acknowledge the stronger localization demand and gross margin sustainability of SMIC,” Morgan Stanley analysts including Charlie Chan wrote in a note. “However, we believe the competition from foundries may get more intense in 2025. In addition, SMIC’s trading valuation does not look attractive to us.” The Hong Kong-listed stock is trading at a forward price-to-book ratio of 1.2 times, above its three-year average level of 0.9 times. Valuation based on book value is seen as more useful than earnings-based multiples for evaluating asset-heavy, cyclical businesses such as chip foundries. SMIC and Hua Hong both look overvalued, “as the market may have overestimated the extent of average selling price recovery,” Morningstar’s Lee said. “Also, the market can be overbullish on the impact of fiscal stimulus.” --With assistance from Jessica Sui.

AI developers are increasingly pitching the next wave of generative AI chatbots as AI “agents” that can do more useful things on people's behalf. But the cost of building and running AI tools is so high that more investors are questioning whether the technology’s promise is overblown. Microsoft said last month that it's preparing for a world where “every organization will have a constellation of agents — ranging from simple prompt-and-response to fully autonomous.” Microsoft elaborated in a blog post Tuesday that such autonomous agents ""can operate around the clock to review and approve customer returns or go over shipping invoices to help businesses avoid costly supply-chain errors.” Microsoft's annual Ignite conference caters to its big business customers. The pivot toward so-called “agentic AI” comes as some users are seeing limits to the large language models behind chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Microsoft's own Copilot. Those systems work by predicting the most plausible next word in a sentence and are good at certain writing-based work tasks. But tech companies have been working to build AI tools that are better at longer-range planning and reasoning so they can access the web or control computers and perform tasks on their own on a user's behalf. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has criticized Microsoft's pivot. Salesforce also has its “Agentforce” service that uses AI in sales, marketing and other tasks. “Microsoft rebranding Copilot as ‘agents’? That’s panic mode,” Benioff said in a social media post last month. He went on to claim that Microsoft's flagship AI assistant, called Copilot, is “a flop” that is inaccurate and spills corporate data.","CHICAGO (AP) — CEO opening company conference in with remarks could set the stage for where it’s taking artificial intelligence business.

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting NYC Mayor Adams Names Jessica Tisch to Lead Police Head Amid Probes The server maker said late Monday that it submitted a plan to the Nasdaq exchange for filing its 10-K financial disclosure report delayed in August. The company also announced that it appointed BDO USA as its independent auditor, effective immediately. “In its compliance plan to Nasdaq, the company indicated that it believes that it will be able to complete its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024, and its quarterly report on 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended Sept. 30, 2024, and become current with its periodic reports within the discretionary period available to the Nasdaq staff to grant,” Super Micro said Monday in a statement. If Super Micro’s proposal is accepted by the exchange, its new deadline for the document will likely be pushed to February. It will be able to stay listed on the Nasdaq until a final decision about its compliance is made. If a plan isn’t approved, the company can appeal the decision. Super Micro’s previous auditor, Ernst & Young LLP, resigned in October, citing concerns over the company’s transparency and governance. Ernst & Young is one of the Big Four accounting firms, the auditors that vet the books of the world’s largest companies. BDO USA is the sixth-largest auditor by revenue, according to Inside Public Accounting. The firm has only one other S&P 500 company as a client, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Finding an auditor is a “big step for them,” even if it isn’t one of the Big Four firms, Matt Bryson, an analyst at Wedbush, said in an interview. “This is a positive step in terms of putting a plan forth in front of Nasdaq, and, at least from their perspective, hopefully being able to file their financials and put these problems to bed.” Having a new auditor and a plan to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s listing rules is the latest update in a tumultuous few months for Super Micro, which had gained favor with investors earlier this year as a potential beneficiary of the demand for artificial intelligence services. The San Jose, California-based company delayed filing its annual 10-K following a damaging report from short seller Hindenburg Research, and last week said it would be late with quarterly reports. Super Micro is also facing a US Department of Justice probe. The shares had tumbled more than 80% from a peak in March through Monday’s close. The company has gone through a delisting and relisting process before. In 2019, the shares were taken off the Nasdaq exchange after Super Micro failed to meet deadlines to file a 10-K and several quarterly reports. The company received approval to rejoin the exchange in 2020, and in the same year paid a $17.5 million penalty to resolve an investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Super Micro didn’t admit to or deny the regulator’s allegations as part of its settlement. Some stock bulls are reiterating their case for the stock. “We take the view that regardless of its regulatory woes (now receding in the rear-view mirror), SMCI maintains its leadership in the massive, scalable AI data center market for liquid-cooled server racks,” said Lynx Equity’s KC Rajkumar. “SMCI has a leadership position in the rapidly expanding liquid-cooled GPU server data center market, a position it is unlikely to give up any time soon,” Rajkumar said. --With assistance from Nicola M.

""I watched her work day in and day out, and she was wasting about seven to eight hours on boring workflow tasks,"" Suri said. ""Only 5% of her time, she had her radiology thinking cap on. That was really sad."" So, Suri, who was an engineer at big data analytics company Confluent at the time, built New Lantern, a startup that automates tedious radiology-related tasks like making measurements on scans and report writing. Suri (pictured lower center) noticed that his mom's workday revolved primarily around two software systems: PACS, or the digital library of medical images where doctors view scans; and the reporting software where she would translate those images into actionable diagnoses. Switching between tools felt unnecessarily clunky, so New Lantern combined these tools into one platform. Eric Vishria, a general partner at Benchmark, said that he’s looked at other startups working on AI-powered radiology but most focused on image analysis. He passed on those others, in part because the technology isn’t really ready to replace human radiologists. For years, it's been predicted that AI would make radiologists obsolete. But instead, there's a shortage of these professionals. Suri's realization was that instead of using AI to analyze images, AI can help with the drudgery “and let the doctor do what doctors enjoy doing and are really good at, which is reading the scans,"" Vishria said. New Lantern claims that its software can significantly enhance radiologists' efficiency, enabling them to complete twice as many cases in the same timeframe. ""That's what got me really excited about it,"" Vishria said. On Wednesday, New Lantern announced that it raised a $19 million Series A led by Benchmark. New Lantern's goal is to replace and modernize how radiologists work not only with the help of AI but also by ensuring that all data is stored in the cloud. Some vendors of PACS, which stands for Picture Archiving and Communication System, are still hosted on-prem, according to Suri. The incumbent providers of PACS are GE Healthcare and Phillips. Meanwhile, Microsoft's Nuance dominates reporting software, but Rad AI, a Khosla Ventures-backed AI-first company, told TechCrunch that it has gained significant market share. However, New Lantern has big plans to completely disrupt radiology software with its product. ""25 years ago, we made the switch from [physical] film to PACS,"" Suri said.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysis-opec-may-stick-deep-154907895.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 7:49 AM","By Alex Lawler, Ahmad Ghaddar and Robert Harvey LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC+ will have little room to manoeuvre on oil policy when it meets in December: it would be risky to increase output because of weak demand, and difficult to deepen supply cuts because some members want to pump more, sources and analysts said. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies led by Russia, the group known as OPEC+, which pumps around half the world's oil, has already delayed a plan to gradually lift production by several months this year. It may push back output increases again when it meets on Dec. 1 due to weak global oil demand, according to three OPEC+ sources familiar with the discussions. Ministers last shelved the increase for a month when they met virtually on Nov. 3. ""I can't say it's popular in the group but there would be no strong objection to a delay until the first quarter,"" one of the OPEC+ sources said, declining to be identified by name. Two other OPEC+ sources said it was too early to say what the group will decide. OPEC and the Saudi government communications office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. OPEC+ had planned to slowly roll back production cuts with small increases over many months in 2024 and 2025. But a slowdown in Chinese and global demand, and rising output outside the group, have put a dampener on that plan. This has left OPEC+ maintaining output cuts for longer than it had thought. The group has cut output by 5.86 million barrels per day, or about 5.7% of global demand, in a series of steps agreed since 2022 to support the market. Despite OPEC+'s cuts and delays to output hikes, oil prices have mostly stayed in the $70-$80 per barrel range this year. Saudi Arabia was keen to address an internal issue of poor compliance with production targets from some OPEC+ members, sources said, before proceeding with any output increase for the group. Some members including Iraq have reduced output in recent months, so compliance has improved. That could give the group a little room for a coordinated small increase in supply - as long as demand supports it. Increasing output in a market with little demand growth, however, would risk weakening prices. It is a tactic OPEC+ could use to put pressure on rivals - but one that would also hurt OPEC+ countries that rely on oil revenues. Many OPEC members need a price of over $70 to balance their budgets and could not sustain a long period of oil below $50. LOW CHANCE OF 'PRICE WAR' Nonetheless, OPEC+'s falling market share has led to speculation that sooner or later, it may launch a price war to push rivals out. The last time OPEC did this was in 2014-2015, when it raised output to squeeze U.S. shale firms. OPEC+'s oil output is equal to 48% of world supply, the lowest since it was formed in 2016 with a market share of over 55%, according to Reuters calculations based on International Energy Agency figures. The U.S. has become the world's largest oil producer, pumping more than 20 million bpd or a fifth of global production. Top OPEC producer Saudi Arabia's crude output is less than 9% of the global oil total, while OPEC supplies around 25%. The 2014 price war had a big impact on shale producers but ultimately failed to stem the boom. U.S. shale and other producers have also cut costs over time, making it harder for OPEC+ to win a new battle.

DEEPER CUTS ALSO UNLIKELY Analysts at Macquarie said the prospects for OPEC+ increasing output in the first half of 2025 looked tenuous given seasonal demand weakness. Deepening production cuts is also unlikely because several OPEC+ members are pushing to pump more, not less. Key among them is the United Arab Emirates, which argues it has kept output at around 3 million bpd for too long, far below its capacity. The UAE has already secured an increased quota for 2025, and any delay to output hikes would need to address this issue, OPEC+ sources said. Iraq has also been pushing for a higher quota.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/physical-ai-startup-brightai-bootstraps-160000063.html,"Tue, Nov 19, 2024, 8:00 AM","When Alex Hawkinson was the CEO of SmartThings, the consumer-focused connected devices company he co-founded and sold to Samsung for around $200 million, he kept thinking that internet of things (IoT) technology could probably solve bigger issues. He left SmartThings in 2018 to figure out where connected devices could make the largest impact. He co-founded IoT company BrightAI, alongside Nathan Hanks, Douglas Burman, and Robert Parker, in 2019. When the pandemic hit in 2020, Hawkinson, now CEO, said that where BrightAI should focus became clear: infrastructure. ""In the pandemic, that downtime, sort of really made you think about what are the really important services that the modern life depends on? As you look at those, it's sort of shocking how antiquated they are in many cases,"" Hawkinson told TechCrunch. Using connected devices to fix critical infrastructure's woes became the basis for BrightAI. Hawkinson described BrightAI today as a ""physical AI"" company. BrightAI offers an end-to-end tech platform that uses sensors to help companies monitor physical assets. BrightAI's sensors are constantly sending data to an AI algorithm that processes the data and can help catch and predict potential issues before they arise. For example, pest control supplier Pelsis uses BrightAI's sensors to remotely monitor its light traps that are installed in food and pharmaceutical production facilities. BrightAI can identify and alert Pelsis if any of their light traps catch a new type of pest in between manual inspections, allowing Pelsis to deploy the necessary treatment earlier. ""It's leaving your inspector there all the time, even when there's not humans around,"" Hawkinson said. ""It lets you have this kind of real-time sense of sites and assets. You're collecting data that humans never did before, because you're there all the time, and then [you] use AI to sort of see the patterns in that and really move from reactive to proactive."" BrightAI launched its platform in stealth in 2023. It currently has seven large enterprise customers across six verticals including HVAC, waste management, and power, among others. It's deployed more than 250,000 sensors and has reached $80 million in revenue while remaining in stealth mode without raising any outside capital — until now. The company is emerging from stealth today and just raised a $15 million seed round funded entirely by Upfront Ventures. Hawkinson said that they decided to take on venture funding now because they needed capital to get to their next level of growth. He added that BrightAI has a lot more customer interest than they can currently serve. BrightAI's seed round capital will be used to expand the company's tech capabilities. Hawkinson said they want BrightAI's tech to be able to tap the data its sensors have collected to help field workers be more informed on how to fix problems. There are numerous startups taking a similar approach to AI and sensor technology that are more verticalized than BrightAI. Sensorita is a Norwegian startup that uses sensors and AI to help monitor and manage construction waste. WaveLogix is another that uses sensors to test the strength and health of concrete. Hawkinson acknowledged that building in one vertical would probably allow them to move faster, but added that they didn't want to limit their total addressable market. ""I felt like by limiting ourselves to one vertical, it would also leave so much untapped potential,"" Hawkinson said. ""So for me, it's just building a great business instead of moving fast and all the rest of it. It's like the way we can sort of maximize the impact we can have in the world."" BrightAI's tech can help companies be more precise too, Hawkinson added. Pest control companies don't need to spray solution everywhere, they can use BrightAI's sensor data to be more targeted. Water companies don't need to send as many trucks of employees out to monitor pipes, if they already know which ones need maintenance. ""It's like this beautiful thing, because as you unlock productivity, and then you unlock capital efficiency, both make these services we rely on so much better,"" Hawkinson said. ""We can reach so much more of it. But also it's pretty cool that it does it in a way that wastes a lot less.""","When Alex was CEO of SmartThings, connected devices company he co-founded sold to for million, he kept thinking internet things (IoT) technology could probably solve bigger left SmartThings in 2018 figure connected devices could make the largest impact.

Chief Executive Officer Cristiano Amon said the company’s push into new markets is going as planned, even after its outlook for revenue growth fell flat with investors. Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting NYC Mayor Adams Names Jessica Tisch to Lead Police Head Amid Probes “Our strategy is working,” he said Wednesday during a Bloomberg Television interview. “We’ve executed on what we said we were going to do.” The remarks followed an investor presentation Tuesday where the chipmaker laid out growth targets for new product categories. Qualcomm, the world’s biggest seller of smartphone processors, has been pushing deeper into automotive parts and chips for connected devices. That’s included a bid to sell processors for personal computers — an area long dominated by Intel Corp. Qualcomm is expecting these new areas to generate an additional $22 billion in annual revenue by fiscal 2029. But the presentation failed to impress investors, who sent the shares down as much as 6.5% to $154 on Wednesday. That was the biggest intraday drop in more than two months. In the interview, Amon said that sales of Qualcomm’s PC chips are “exceeding expectations.” The CEO, who took the reins in 2021, is counting on that segment to generate $4 billion a year by 2029, a target he said is very achievable. The broader Internet of Things category should provide $14 billion annually by that year, Qualcomm said. The market — a catch-all term for connected devices — includes PCs, industrial machinery, virtual reality gear and other equipment. Qualcomm’s expansion into automotive chips, meanwhile, is expected to generate $8 billion a year by that time. The San Diego-based company is under added pressure to diversify because it’s set to lose one of its largest customers, Apple Inc. The iPhone maker is developing its own radio connectivity components, which will replace the products it buys from Qualcomm. Apple’s attempts to supplant Qualcomm chips haven’t gone smoothly so far, and it has extended its supply agreement with the company twice in the past. But — with or without Apple — Amon said he’s confident that Qualcomm can reach its targets for the end of the decade. By that point, non-smartphone revenue should account for about half its sales. Amon said that he’s not worried about his business in China, the biggest provider of revenue by region. He expects the capabilities of his chips to continue to attract Chinese customers. And because Qualcomm is an exporter of technology, he’s not concerned about trade tariffs proposed by incoming President Donald Trump. Qualcomm also doesn’t need to make a big acquisition to achieve its goals, he said. The chipmaker has been the subject of reports, including by Bloomberg, that it was interested in possibly acquiring part of Intel. “Right now, at this time, we have not identified any large acquisition that is necessary for us to execute on this $22 billion,” he said when asked about his interest in Intel. The company’s total market opportunity will be $900 billion by 2030, Amon said.

Qualcomm, which gets the majority of its revenue from designing and licensing handset chips, has been expanding into semiconductors that go into cars, personal computers, and other devices. The company now expects those businesses to generate a combined $22 billion in sales by 2029. Sales of $8 billion will come from Qualcomm’s automotive segment, where it already has partnerships with the likes of BMW to increase computing functionality in vehicles and push toward more autonomous driving. Qualcomm forecast that $14 billion will come from its Internet of Things segment, which includes extended reality devices and industrial functions. It also includes PCs, expected to account for $4 billion. The company’s Snapdragon X Elite chips power Microsoft’s latest-generation Surface laptops, which feature the GenAI Copilot assistant. “Everybody that buys an X Elite is extremely happy with it,” Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said in an interview following the investor day in New York. “From all of our OEMs [original equipment manufacturers] and Microsoft, the current response is exceeding everybody's expectation.” Amon called the $4 billion target for the PC business “high confidence.” Some analysts, however, said the road there may not be smooth. “While management is optimistic about AI PC opportunities, Windows-on-ARM skepticism and intense competition (from both x86 and ARM SoC suppliers) could limit QCOM’s opportunity,” Raymond James’ Srini Pajjuri wrote in a note to clients. He has a Hold-equivalent Market Perform rating on the stock. Bank of America’s Tal Liani rates Qualcomm a Buy and “came away incrementally positive on Qualcomm’s long-term positioning and the diversification outside of handsets.” But Liani pointed out that not only is the company entering markets with emerging tech, but it also needs to grab market share. ""These markets need to develop to support Qualcomm's long-term targets, of which the pace and magnitude [are] uncertain,"" he wrote. Qualcomm’s biggest business remains smartphones, and its ramped-up diversification comes as Apple (AAPL) is working on migrating away from Qualcomm modems. As for the Android-based business, Amon said he’s projecting mid-single-digit growth, what he calls a “conservative assumption.” That means the company expects to end the decade with revenue about evenly split between handsets at 50% and autos and Internet of Things combined at the other 50%. “The narrative of solid earnings power even ex-AAPL seems alive, and in general the assumptions don’t appear to require any huge stretches,” wrote Bernstein’s Stacy Rasgon, who has an Outperform recommendation on Qualcomm shares. Qualcomm shares have lagged this year amid that expected Apple transition, rising just under 7% compared with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index’s (^SOX) 16% gain. So what about artificial intelligence? Amon expects the adoption of smartphones with more AI capabilities to be an unpredictable process but one that’s ultimately beneficial for Qualcomm. “It is hard to make a prediction because, at the end of the day, it's all based on what developers are going to come up with,” he said in the interview. ""I can go back to the conversation between feature phones and smartphones and BlackBerrys, and smartphones started with 10 apps, then a hundred apps, then thousands of apps, and then you start to see the big switch,"" he added. ""And I feel the same way about AI use cases. I can't really tell you it's going to be this year or next year.

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting NYC Mayor Adams Names Jessica Tisch to Lead Police Head Amid Probes SpaceX’s launch system, comprised of the booster and Starship upper spacecraft, cleared the tower shortly after 4 p.m. local time on Tuesday. But minutes into the flight, SpaceX scrapped plans to attempt to catch the booster with giant mechanical arms — referred to as “chopsticks” — which the company completed during its previous flight. The booster, dubbed Super Heavy, was still able to perform a controlled landing in the ocean. “It was pretty epic on attempt one, but the safety of the teams and the public and the pad itself are paramount,” SpaceX engineer Kate Tice said on a live broadcast. “So we are accepting compromises.” After Super Heavy landed in the Gulf of Mexico, Starship continued its voyage through space. At one point, it successfully reignited one of its Raptor engines — the first time SpaceX was able to do so during these flight tests. Starship will need to reignite its engines in order to control its descent to Earth and maneuver through space. Starship then circled most of the globe before plunging through the atmosphere about 45 minutes into the mission, its body engulfed in the reddish orange glow of plasma as its upgraded heat shield endured intense temperatures while hurtling back to Earth. Starship appeared to survive the reentry, moving its exterior flaps to help guide its descent, though some showed signs of burn and slight damage. Then, as Starship fell through clouds, it flipped itself and reignited its engines to turn upright and softly splash into the Indian Ocean shortly after 6 p.m. New York time. It then appeared to catch on fire. “Turns out the vehicle had more capability than our calculations predicted, and that is why we test like we fly,” Tice said. The largest and most powerful rocket ever developed, Starship is under contract to function as a lunar lander that NASA will use to put people back on the moon for the first time in half a century. It’s the centerpiece of Musk’s ambition to start a settlement on Mars. The vehicle is also meant to revolutionize SpaceX’s business plan. Designed to be fully reusable, Starship will be much cheaper to fly than any other rocket, according to SpaceX, and will eventually replace the company’s industry-leading Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets. But to meet that promise of delivering a fully reusable rocket, SpaceX must refine its technique for recovering all of the pieces of Starship after launch. Around the time SpaceX aborted the booster catch, Trump and Musk left to visit the Starfactory courtyard for a visual tour of the factory bays and rockets. Trump had arrived at a launch viewing location with Musk about an hour before liftoff. Trump, wearing a blue suit and red MAGA hat, stood flanked by allies, including Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz and Donald Trump Jr., as the group peppered Musk with questions on how the launch works.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-rivals-focus-building-different-160628308.html,"Tue, Nov 19, 2024, 8:06 AM","SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) — Building the current crop of artificial intelligence chatbots has relied on specialized computer chips pioneered by Nvidia, which cornered the market and made itself the poster child of the AI boom. But the same qualities that make those graphics processor chips, or GPUs, so effective at creating powerful AI systems from scratch make them less efficient at putting AI products to work. That's opened up the AI chip industry to rivals who think they can compete with Nvidia in selling so-called AI inference chips that are more attuned to the day-to-day running of AI tools and designed to reduce some of the huge computing costs of generative AI. “These companies are seeing opportunity for that kind of specialized hardware,” said Jacob Feldgoise, an analyst at Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology. “The broader the adoption of these models, the more compute will be needed for inference and the more demand there will be for inference chips.” What is AI inference? It takes a lot of computing power to make an AI chatbot. It starts with a process called training or pretraining — the “P” in ChatGPT — that involves AI systems “learning” from the patterns of huge troves of data. GPUs are good at doing that work because they can run many calculations at a time on a network of devices in communication with each other. However, once trained, a generative AI tool still needs chips to do the work — such as when you ask a chatbot to compose a document or generate an image. That's where inferencing comes in. A trained AI model must take in new information and make inferences from what it already knows to produce a response. GPUs can do that work, too. But it can be a bit like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut. “With training, you’re doing a lot heavier, a lot more work. With inferencing, that’s a lighter weight,” said Forrester analyst Alvin Nguyen. That's led startups like Cerebras, Groq and d-Matrix as well as Nvidia's traditional chipmaking rivals — such as AMD and Intel — to pitch more inference-friendly chips as Nvidia focuses on meeting the huge demand from bigger tech companies for its higher-end hardware. Inside an AI inference chip lab D-Matrix, which is launching its first product this week, was founded in 2019 — a bit late to the AI chip game, as CEO Sid Sheth explained during a recent interview at the company’s headquarters in Santa Clara, California, the same Silicon Valley city that's also home to AMD, Intel and Nvidia. “There were already 100-plus companies. So when we went out there, the first reaction we got was ‘you’re too late,’” he said. The pandemic's arrival six months later didn't help as the tech industry pivoted to a focus on software to serve remote work. Now, however, Sheth sees a big market in AI inferencing, comparing that later stage of machine learning to how human beings apply the knowledge they acquired in school. “We spent the first 20 years of our lives going to school, educating ourselves. That’s training, right?” he said. “And then the next 40 years of your life, you kind of go out there and apply that knowledge — and then you get rewarded for being efficient.” The product, called Corsair, consists of two chips with four chiplets each, made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company — the same manufacturer of most of Nvidia's chips — and packaged together in a way that helps to keep them cool. The chips are designed in Santa Clara, assembled in Taiwan and then tested back in California. Testing is a long process and can take six months — if anything is off, it can be sent back to Taiwan. D-Matrix workers were doing final testing on the chips during a recent visit to a laboratory with blue metal desks covered with cables, motherboards and computers, with a cold server room next door. Who wants AI inference chips? While tech giants like Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft have been gobbling up the supply of costly GPUs in a race to outdo each other in AI development, makers of AI inference chips are aiming for a broader clientele. Forrester's Nguyen said that could include Fortune 500 companies that want to make use of new generative AI technology without having to build their own AI infrastructure. Sheth said he expects a strong interest in AI video generation. “The dream of AI for a lot of these enterprise companies is you can use your own enterprise data,” Nguyen said. “Buying (AI inference chips) should be cheaper than buying the ultimate GPUs from Nvidia and others. But I think there’s going to be a learning curve in terms of integrating it.” Feldgoise said that, unlike training-focused chips, AI inference work prioritizes how fast a person will get a chatbot's response. He said another whole set of companies is developing AI hardware for inference that can run not just in big data centers but locally on desktop computers, laptops and phones. Why does this matter? Better-designed chips could bring down the huge costs of running AI to businesses. That could also affect the environmental and energy costs for everyone else. Sheth says the big concern right now is, “are we going to burn the planet down in our quest for what people call AGI — human-like intelligence?” It’s still fuzzy when AI might get to the point of artificial general intelligence — predictions range from a few years to decades. But, Sheth notes, only a handful of tech giants are on that quest. “But then what about the rest?” he said. “They cannot be put on the same path.” The other set of companies don’t want to use very large AI models — it’s too costly and uses too much energy. “I don’t know if people truly, really appreciate that inference is actually really going to be a much bigger opportunity than training. I don’t think they appreciate that. It’s still training that is really grabbing all the headlines,” Sheth said.","(AP) — Building the crop intelligence chatbots relied on specialized chips pioneered by Nvidia, which the market made itself of the AI But the that make those graphics processor chips, or GPUs, so effective creating powerful AI systems from scratch make less AI products work.

The process starts Wednesday when US prosecutors are expected to submit a document in federal court outlining specific remedies after successfully arguing in a landmark trial that Google ran its search engine empire as an illegal monopoly. The DOJ is expected to ask Google's parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) to sell off its Chrome browser, according to a report in Bloomberg. The Wall Street Journal reported that divestments could include the Android mobile operating system if Google doesn't meet certain conditions. Prosecutors may also call for new data licensing requirements or an end to agreements that secure Google's search engine as a default on mobile devices and internet browsers. DOJ outlined a framework of options last month, but the filing Wednesday is expected to be a lot more specific about what it wants to happen. It will then be up to District of Columbia District Court Judge Amit Mehta, who sided with the DOJ’s monopoly argument, to decide what should happen next in a separate ""remedies"" phase of the trial that will likely start in 2025. A DOJ breakup request would be the latest of many aggressive signals sent to the tech world during a wide-ranging effort by the Biden administration to rein in what it views as anticompetitive behavior across a number of industries. The administration has already alleged anticompetitive conduct against tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) and claimed that Microsoft's acquisition of gaming giant Activision Blizzard would create a gaming market monopoly. ""The DOJ continues to push a radical agenda that goes far beyond the legal issues in this case,"" Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs, told Yahoo Finance in an email. ""The government putting its thumb on the scale in these ways would harm consumers, developers and American technological leadership at precisely the moment it is most needed."" It is not yet known whether a new Trump administration would let all of those Big Tech antitrust cases continue. Some legal experts don't expect the crackdown to let up. After all, it was Trump's DOJ that initiated the antitrust suit against Google after it concluded the company used illegal tactics to monopolize search. But Trump in October also suggested that Google’s punishment could be accomplished without forcing it to sell off parts of its empire. ""What you can do without breaking it up is make sure it’s more fair,"" Trump said in an Oct. 15 interview. He described Google’s search engine as ""rigged"" and expressed concern that consequences for Google in the case could favor China. The proposal to carve up Google would be the first step from the Justice Department to break apart a tech empire since it tried to do so more than two decades ago with Microsoft (MSFT). That case resulted in a 2002 settlement that opened the door to broader competition in the internet browser software market. A DOJ request to divest part of Google’s empire isn’t surprising, according to Vanderbilt Law School associate dean for research Rebecca Allensworth, because ""it makes sense to ask for more than you are going to get."" But what she expects the judge to actually approve is data sharing as opposed to a spin-off of Chrome. ""We don’t know what the judge is going to impose yet,"" she told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday. Jean-Paul Schmetz, chief of ads for search engine provider Brave, said a spin-off of Chrome is not likely to achieve the government's goals. ""My opinion is that if you have a browser — Safari, Firefox, Brave, whatever — and you send traffic to Google, then you should be compensated in a nondiscriminatory manner,"" Schmetz said. ""At the moment,"" Schmetz added, ""you only get money if you promise to Google that you're not going to compete against them."" Judge Mehta has scheduled a remedies hearing to take place in April, and he has previously said he plans to issue a final ruling by August 2025. Google has promised to appeal. And Judge Mehta could hold off on any orders to alter Google's behavior while it challenges his ruling in D.C.’s Circuit Court of Appeals. The judge would lose the right to impose remedies if Google is found not to have broken the law on appeal. And even if Google fails and is ordered to change its behavior, Judge Mehta could later adjust his orders to better ensure competition is restored. What is not yet known is how Trump’s term, which starts Jan. 20, could alter how this case is resolved.

The energy research firm indicates that investments by industry giants such as ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP, Shell, TotalEnergies, and Eni could add 286,000 barrels per day (bpd) of production capacity. SAF, produced from waste and residue like used cooking oil or organic crops, emits the same amount of carbon dioxide as kerosene when burned. However, it's considered less polluting due to its production from leftovers or plants rather than newly drilled oil, which releases additional greenhouse gases. The aviation industry accounts for nearly 2% of global energy-related carbon dioxide emissions. ""As the energy transition progresses, these biofuels offer a practical, near-term solution to reduce emissions without requiring significant changes to current infrastructure,"" said Lars Klesse, analyst of bioenergy research at Rystad. BP leads the pack with the largest announced production capacity, reaching a combined 130,000 bpd. Strategic acquisitions, such as BP's purchase of Bunge Bioenergia and Chevron's takeover of Renewable Energy Group, have strengthened oil majors' positions in this space. Despite its higher cost compared to petroleum-based jet fuel, SAF uptake is gaining momentum.

OpenAI’s co-founder and former chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, who played a key role in firing Altman and left the company in May, received $322,201 in 2023, making him one of the highest paid officers listed on the form. Emmett Shear, the co-founder of Twitch who served as interim CEO during Altman’s ouster, was paid $3,720, according to the filing. Though Shear’s tenure appeared to last for about three days, the filing said he was paid from Nov. 19 to Nov. 29, which would be $338.18 per day, including weekends. The total compensation could be much higher for some executives, however. The tax filing does not include any equity-based compensation that OpenAI’s named officers may have received as the company’s valuation has soared. It also doesn’t disclose any outside investment from venture capitalists into OpenAI’s for-profit entities.There is only limited visibility into OpenAI’s financials given the lag in reporting and the number of companies that are related to its business. The nonprofit lists several partnership companies and related entities, including Aestas LLC, which oversees employee and investor equity. According to the filing, OpenAI’s nonprofit received $5 million in public contributions in 2023, but the source of the funding wasn’t disclosed. The nonprofit ended 2023 with net assets of more than $21 million — a tiny sum compared to the $6.6 billion the company raised in October to support its efforts to keep building powerful AI products. Last year, OpenAI expanded its charitable giving beyond universal basic income projects linked to Altman, according to the filing. It funded an ethics and journalism grant at New York University as well as research into AI economic opportunity through Atlanta-based nonprofit Operation Hope. OpenAI also provided financial support for experiments “in setting up a democratic process for deciding what rules AI systems should follow,” the company said. The grants went to US institutions such as Harvard College, the University of Washington and the University of Michigan, along with a recipient in East Asia. “As part of our charter, we’re committed to collaborating globally with research and policy institutions to address AGI’s challenges, and increased grants support this mission,” an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ex-bankman-fried-ally-gary-171606859.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 1:18 PM","(Bloomberg) -- FTX co-founder Gary Wang has been spared from prison over his role in the multibillion dollar fraud at the cryptocurrency exchange after prosecutors praised his early cooperation in the case. Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll NYC Mayor Adams Names Jessica Tisch to Lead Police Head Amid Probes Wang, whose assistance helped convict the orchestrator of the fraud, Sam Bankman-Fried, was sentenced to time served Wednesday by US District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan in Manhattan. The judge said Wang, 31, had done the right thing for both himself and the country by cooperating so quickly to help unravel one of the biggest financial frauds in US history. Kaplan appeared taken aback by the prosecution’s strong advocacy for Wang. “I’ve never seen anything quite like what happened here,” the judge said, adding that Wang is “entitled to a world of credit.” After FTX imploded in late 2022, Wang was the first cooperator through the door at the US Attorney’s Office and went above and beyond to help investigators, his lawyers and the government pointed out. Wang, whose wife is expecting their first child this month, even built a software program to help the Justice Department detect fraud in financial markets. Bankman-Fried is serving 25 years in prison after a jury found him guilty of orchestrating the yearslong fraud that allowed customer funds to be diverted to sister hedge fund Alameda Research. From there, money was spent on luxury real estate, campaign donations and risky investments. “I profoundly regret my choices,” Wang said during brief remarks at the hearing, becoming emotional at times. “Nothing I do will ever be able to make up for those choices.” Wang said he wished to remain free so he could continue helping FTX’s bankruptcy estate and provide for his family. MIT, Math Camp Wang was ordered to forfeit more than $11 billion — the same amount for all the defendants. According to a judgment filed after the sentencing, Wang has already satisfied the order by agreeing to liquidate his Vanguard and Coinbase accounts and give the proceeds to the US. Wang also agreed to give up any interest in the more than $600 million in proceeds seized from a Robinhood Markets account affiliated with Bankman-Fried and FTX nearly two years ago. Wang and Bankman-Fried had been friends for years, having met at math camp as teenagers before joining the same fraternity at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Bankman-Fried enticed Wang to leave his job as a software engineer at Google and help him build Alameda Research. In a few years the men would become young billionaires after launching FTX, one of the biggest crypto exchanges in the world. Assistant US Attorney Nicolas Roos said after Wang’s remarks that the former executive was unlike any other cooperator he had worked with. He said Wang saved the government years of work by immediately unwinding the FTX code early in the investigation, allowing the case to proceed quickly. ‘Sanskrit’ FTX Code “He came in and deciphered basically half the case in the first day,” Roos said. “He has this incredibly unique skill-set,” the prosecutor said, adding that the FTX code was like “Sanskrit” that only an expert like Wang could have understood. Roos added that Wang became aware of the fraud late and wasn’t culpable for a long period. It “would have been easy” for someone like Wang, with a limited role in a fraud, to choose to fight the charges, the prosecutor said. Wang’s lawyer Ilan Graff declined to comment on the sentence. During the hearing, Graff told the judge that Wang spent his time at FTX “sitting at his computer” working diligently while others at the company “mingled with celebrities.” Wang “did not knowingly create the back door” in FTX’s code that was used for the fraud. Wang’s lawyers had asked the judge not to impose a prison sentence, seeking to distance their client from the other former company executives who cut deals with the government. Prosecutors didn’t recommend a sentence and instead pointed to his cooperation as a grounds for leniency. Unlike the other co-conspirators, Wang did not lie to customers, lenders or investors and didn’t spend customer money on himself, his lawyers argued. He used his first year’s income working with Bankman-Fried to pay off his parents’ mortgage and flew economy while his colleagues traveled by private jet. The other executives have met with mixed results when sentenced by Kaplan. Ellison Sentence Former Alameda Research CEO — and Bankman-Fried’s one-time girlfriend — Caroline Ellison was sentenced to two years in prison in September despite Kaplan praising her cooperation with prosecutors as “remarkable.” Ryan Salame, who led FTX’s Bahamas subsidiary, is currently serving seven and a half years in prison. While he pleaded guilty to taking part in a sprawling campaign-finance scheme, he didn’t agree to testify against Bankman-Fried. Former FTX chief engineer Nishad Singh, who like Wang and Ellison did testify, avoided prison and was sentenced to three years of supervised release.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/codecrafters-wants-challenge-seasoned-developers-170000413.html,"Tue, Nov 19, 2024, 3:18 PM","There are plenty of online platforms for developers that help you learn new skills or get started with a new language, such as Codecademy, LeetCode, and CodeSignal. Some guide developers step by step through the process while teaching the basics, while others provide detailed video tutorials. Codecrafters is a platform that doesn't want to show developer videos or hold their hands when they're learning new languages. Instead, it wants to provide tough challenges for advanced developers to build a project, master a programming language, and learn other concepts along the way. The Y Combinator-backed startup was built by Sarup Banskota and Paul Kuruvilla in 2022. The pair met during IIT prep school in Chennai. After completing university, Kuruvilla became a manager at the company where he worked and set himself the challenge of building a Redis clone from scratch — Redis is an open source data structure store — to upskill and motivate team members. He eventually made a workshop out of this experience and put it on a website with instructions. Banskota told TechCrunch this was essentially Codecrafters v0, but for Kuruvilla's workshops. After Banskota quit his job at Vercel, the duo started to build Codecrafters. They thought people would come to the site to learn the internals of Git, Docker, or Redis. But instead, people came to master a programming language. When the startup joined Y Combinator, it wasn't making money, and the duo had to tune the product for a better product-market fit. ""During the very first days of YC, advisors asked us about monetization. We added a pricing page on our site. But our users didn't like us as much when we started charging them. We had to build features to justify our monetization and make the journey of using the platform better during that time,"" Banskota said. The company has raised a $1.8 million seed round from notable individuals, including Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger, Dropbox co-founder Arash Ferdowsi, ex-Vercel COO Kevin Van Gundy, Supabase CEO Paul Copplestone, Basecase Capital's solo VC Alana Goyal, and PlanetScale co-founder Jitendra Vaidya. Krieger, who is now chief product officer at Anthropic, told TechCrunch over email that he has always picked up new skills by building projects. ""I find building software end to end to be a much more satisfying experience than just learning syntax. What I love about Codecrafters is that all the learning is grounded in building real things — the challenges, like building Redis or SQLite from scratch — both deepen students' understanding of the language they're studying but also of core concepts like distributed systems performance, and API design,"" he said. The core premise of Codecrafters is ""Build your own x"" projects, such as a BitTorrent client, Git, Redis, Docker, Shell, a text editor, and more. Once you create an account on Codecrafters, you get to choose from an array of these challenges. The platform has divided these challenges into different stages and assigned difficulty levels against those stages, along with the details of how the project would work. You can select a programming language of your choice for that project and also choose your proficiency with that language. If you are a beginner, the platform points you to a resource where you can get started and come back to attempt the challenge when you are better versed in the language. After the initial setup, Codecrafters builds a repository for you, which you can clone to your system. The initial repository has code that is meant to get you started with the project. You can use a choice of your development environment (IDE) to build the project and commit code to the repository. Each stage comes with a page that explains the task, a discussion tab with comments and tips from other folks who attempted the challenge, some coding solutions for builders to compare the core logic, and concept explanations and resources. The company has also implemented an AI chatbot that explains code solutions to users in the context of the stage. As for paid customers, the company offers a continuous integration (CI) layer so they can quickly test their code, get automated feedback, and keep working on the project. Developers can access challenges for free, but they will only get access to the content of the first two stages (or all stages for the project of the month). They can pay to access unlimited content, practice in anonymous mode, take advantage of the CI features and get priority support. Currently, Codecrafters offers a three-month plan for $120, an annual plan of $360, and a $990 lifetime plan. Currently, most of the people working with Codecrafters are contractors. The team is constantly creating new additions and extensions to current challenges and thinking about new challenges for coders. In addition to the bot that explains code, the company is also working on a feature to provide AI-powered hints to users. Banskota said that their advantage over other generalized chatbots is that the company trains models in the context of solutions for different challenges. ""Any chatbot will be able to tell you solutions for a code block or a problem. However, we have code submissions from different developers for the same problem. So we have an advantage of creating better contextual hints,"" he said. Codecrafters investor and former Vercel COO Kevin Van Gundy said that there are a lot of tools for beginners, but there aren't many companies building solutions for experienced devs to pick up new skills or capabilities. ""There are plenty of videos on YouTube, resources from like Khan Academy and MIT for people to learn. However, the interaction layer for developers is essential. It's important for platforms like Codecrafters to build incremental steps for developers to keep them engaged,"" he said. ""The platform enables developers to go through the process of building whole applications. Engineers who have gone through an entire problem set like that tend to be better builders."" Companies like OpenAI and Anthropic are building tools that generate code and help engineers automate some of their processes. Amid this, Krieger believes that high-level software design will be a sought-after skill. ""As LLMs continue to improve in their ability to both generate code and also help with agentic coding tasks that are more end-to-end, the skills that will be valued by employers (and useful to entrepreneurs) are the higher-level software design that Codecrafters teaches through its courses,"" he said.","are plenty of online platforms for help you learn skills started with a new such Codecademy, LeetCode, and CodeSignal. guide developers step by step process while the basics, while others detailed video Codecrafters is platform that want to show developer videos or hold their hands when they're new languages.

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting NYC Mayor Adams Names Jessica Tisch to Lead Police Head Amid Probes A high-speed fiber optic cable connecting Finland and Germany was cut early Monday by what was likely an external impact and a nearby link between Lithuania and Sweden was damaged on Sunday. It was the second such incident in the Baltic Sea in just over a year. The bulk carrier, Yi Peng 3, was in the vicinity of the cables when they were damaged, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It has been anchored in the northern part of the Danish straits since Tuesday, with Danish Navy diving ship Soloven close by. “We are present in the area near the Chinese ship Yi Peng 3,” the Danish armed forces said in a post on X. The military stopped short of linking the ship to the cable incident, and said they had no further comments. Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen called the situation “serious,” adding that it’s not certain that the ship is connected with any acts of sabotage. He declined to provide any details about the Danish military’s interaction with the ship. Yi Peng 3 had departed Russian port Ust-Luga on Friday. While vessels sometimes stop for refueling at sea, its current location near Denmark is not a typical site for such activity. The incidents are being probed by Swedish police as possible sabotage, and German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius on Tuesday said the events have to be investigated as such an act. Lin Jian, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry in Beijing, said on Wednesday that “China always fully fulfills flag state obligations and asks Chinese vessels to strictly abide by relevant laws and regulations.” “We also attach great importance to protecting the safety and security of infrastructure,” he said, adding that China works “with the international community to vigorously advance the construction and protection of global information infrastructure including undersea cables.” Germany has already stepped up patrols around its northern coastal areas due to the 2022 attack on the Nord Stream gas pipelines and protecting critical infrastructure is a top priority, Interior Ministry spokesman Cornelius Funke said at a news conference in Berlin. The Swedish navy is conducting an investigation of the seabed to see what may have happened, spokesman Jimmie Adamsson told newspaper Goteborgs-Posten. Finland’s National Bureau of Investigation decided to open a criminal investigation into the damage caused to the sea cable between Finland and Germany, probing the incident as “aggravated criminal mischief and aggravated interference with communications,” according to a statement. “The theory regarding the Chinese ship is now dominant but we’ve got to wait until further confirmation,” said Lithuanian Defense Minister Laurynas Kasciunas, calling for a response once details of the act are known. “Hostile nations will keep pushing the line” if there’s no response, he said. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said earlier Wednesday that it wouldn’t be a surprise if the severing of the two data cables in the Baltic Sea was found to be intentional. “If the immediate assessment is that this is sabotage, and that it comes from outside, then it is obviously serious,” Frederiksen said, according to a report by news agency Ritzau. There’s a high likelihood that a 1,200-kilometer (750-mile) high-speed fiber optic Helsinki-Rostock link serving data centers is completely cut as all of its fiber connections are down, its owner Cinia Oy has said. A repair ship expected to reach the site next week is due to try and identify what caused the breakage. All four nations affected by cable breaches are also members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Just over a year ago, the anchor of a passing ship severed two data cables and a gas pipeline on the seabed of the Gulf of Finland, and the military bloc pledged to respond if the damage proved to be intentional. In his remarks, Pistorius pointed to Russia as posing a hybrid and military threat to the European Union. Russia has denied involvement in any of the incidents. --With assistance from Iain Rogers, Tom Fevrier, Christopher Jungstedt, Christian Wienberg and Milda Seputyte.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-sinochem-may-keep-bankrupt-105745950.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 2:57 AM","By Chen Aizhu SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Sinochem Group may keep three bankrupt oil refineries located in eastern China after auctions to sell them drew little interest from other companies, sources familiar with the matter said. The lack of interest in the plants illustrates the woeful state of the refining sector in China, the world's biggest oil importer and second-largest consumer. Beset by flagging fuel demand amid slower economic growth that has eroded margins, the country's plants are processing less crude than the year before. The Sinochem plants, which are smaller, older and less sophisticated refineries known as teapots, are also contending with greater regulatory scrutiny that threatens the survival of other companies in Shandong province, where the majority of the teapot plants are located. Failure to sell the refineries during their individual auctions may mean state-owned Sinochem will retain them by writing down debts to creditors and renegotiating taxes owed, according to two sources familiar with Sinochem's thinking. Sinochem declined to comment. The exact amount of the debt could not immediately be ascertained, but tax administration records for the cities in Shandong where the refineries are located show that by mid-2024 the plants had accumulated combined unpaid consumption taxes of about 13.2 billion yuan ($1.82 billion). The plants, Changyi Petrochemical, Huaxing Petrochemical Group and Zhenghe Group Co, have combined crude processing capacity of 380,000 barrels per day, or 3% of national output, and were put up for auction in October through the government-backed Shandong Property Right Exchange Centre. Huaxing was offered at 8.7 billion yuan, Changyi at 6.4 billion yuan and Zhenghe for 6.3 billion yuan, data on the Centre's website showed. Sinochem, which separately runs a refinery and petrochemical complex in the southeastern province of Fujian, inherited the troubled Shandong refineries in a Beijing-orchestrated merger in 2021 with their previous operator, state-owned ChemChina. The auctions followed local court orders in September declaring all three companies bankrupt after reorganization procedures were called off. Documents on the Centre's website show that the plants do not have crude oil import quotas and that a new owner would need to re-apply for all operating licenses. That would be a deterrent to would-be buyers, said several sources at other independent refiners operating in Shandong. Without crude import quotas, the plants must rely on processing imported fuel oil, a costlier feedstock because of tariffs and the consumption tax, the sources said. Unlike rival independent refiners in Shandong, Sinochem's plants have shunned discounted crude from Russia, Iran and Venezuela because of Western sanctions, putting them at a competitive disadvantage. Dismantling the plants is an unlikely option that could mean the loss of thousands of jobs, something social stability-obsessed local authorities would be wary of, said the two sources familiar with Sinochem's thinking. Sinochem halted operations at Zhenghe and Changyi in mid-2024 as high crude oil costs and weak fuel demand reduced margins. The third plant, Huaxing Petrochemical, was closed in recent weeks, according to local consultancy Sublime China Information. In late 2021, the Shandong government ordered the three plants to ""self-rectify"" any irregular fuel tax practices, part of a national clampdown on independent refiners related to quota usage and tax payments.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morning-bid-nvidia-vigil-sees-112547969.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 3:25 AM","A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan Tuesday's geopolitical angst faded fast in world markets as positioning ahead of today's results from AI-giant Nvidia saw Big Tech lead a Wall Street rebound - one that futures look to have sustained overnight. After months of basically ignoring the Ukraine conflict, world markets suddenly got the jitters yesterday after Ukraine made use of its new freedom to use U.S.-supplied missiles on Russian territory and Moscow responded with nuclear threats. But with so much of the conflict now in flux as Donald Trump's new administration prepares to take the helm in Washington in January, investors were wary of over-interpreting daily events there for now or chasing 'safety trades' too far. Reinforcing the point on Wednesday, the Kremlin seems keen to position itself for some sort of Trump-brokered settlement - even though it rules out making any territorial concessions and insists Kyiv abandon ambitions to join NATO. The upshot in markets over the past 24 hours has been to return the focus to the two other obsessions of the week - the Nvidia earnings update after the bell today and speculation about who gets the nod to take over the Treasury next year. The rebound in U.S. stocks on Tuesday was aided by a 3% advance in WalMart to a record closing high after the retailer raised its annual sales and profit forecasts for the third consecutive time - with some aggravating inflation signals also embedded in some of its pricing readouts. But earnings from the $3.6 trillion-valued Nvidia will likely steal the show later and its stock surged almost 5% on Tuesday ahead of the release. Options traders are primed for a nearly $300-billion swing in its market value following the chipmaker's results on Wednesday. Nvidia options implied an 8.5% swing in either direction - in line with previous percentage results-day moves but now amplified by sheer scale of market cap in what's now the world's most highly-valued company. Encouraging the renewed tech fizz, Super Micro Computer jumped more than 30% on Tuesday after the artificial intelligence server maker named BDO USA as its auditor and said it has submitted a plan to the Nasdaq to avoid delisting. All of which saw megacap tech outperform yesterday, even though the wider market was less enthused and the equal-weighted S&P500 actually ended in the red. Combining the tech excitement and a post-election crypto surge on Trump-related de-regulation hopes, Bitcoin resumed its climb and topped $94,000 for the first time overnight. The latest spur was a report that Trump's social media company was in talks to buy crypto trading firm Bakkt. In fixed income, Treasuries also gave back their brief safety bid overnight too - with a 20-year bond auction due later in the day. Even though housing starts numbers showed some softness on Tuesday, benchmark 10-year yields reclaimed all of the day's losses and climbed back above 4.4%. Speculation about who gets the nod as Treasury Secretary remains intense, with one of those tipped - Cantor Fitzgerald boss Howard Lutnick - now out of the running as he was nominated for the Commerce Department role instead. Former Federal Reserve governor Kevin Warsh remains the favorite in betting markets, but some reports said Apollo chief executive Marc Rowan is still being considered. Elsewhere, the rebound in stocks and Treasury yields pushed the dollar higher across the board - but stock markets in Asia and Europe also advanced on Wednesday, even China's tariff-wary equity indexes. Sterling and gilt yields pushed higher after a slightly hotter-than-forecast British inflation reading for last month, with the headline consumer price inflation rate jumping as high as 2.3% and above the Bank of England's target again. Although skewed by shifts in regulated energy prices, the news is likely to reinforce the BoE's cautious stance on further interest rate cuts and money markets now don't see another quarter-point rate cut until March. Curiously, Fed futures also don't fully price another U.S. rate cut until March - although there's slightly more than a 50% chance it pulls the trigger again next month. The Japanese yen, meantime, also gave up its 'safety bid' from Tuesday - even after robust October export data. Japan's exports expanded faster than expected last month, led by a pick-up in chip equipment demand in China that may nod to some hurried trade activity before Trump takes office and potentially kicks off a fresh tariff war. Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Wednesday: * US corporate earnings: Nvidia, Palo Alto Networks, Target, TJX * Federal Reserve Board Governors Michelle Bowman and Lisa Cook and Boston Fed President Susan Collins all speak, Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr testifies in the House; European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos and Irish central bank chief Gabriel Makhlouf all speak; Bank of England policymaker Dave Ramsden speaks * US Treasury sells $16 billion of 20-year bonds (By Mike Dolan,; mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com; Editing by Toby Chopra) This is what could happen next to Nvidia shares.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ai-boom-turns-power-firms-113135464.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 3:31 AM","(Bloomberg) -- The artificial intelligence revolution is driving such an insatiable quest for cash that it’s rewiring one section of US capital markets. Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting NYC Mayor Adams Names Jessica Tisch to Lead Police Head Amid Probes Utilities, which are racing to keep up with surging electricity demand to power AI data centers, have dethroned US banks as the biggest sellers of subordinated securities to big investors. Dominion Energy Inc., CenterPoint Energy Inc. and others have raised nearly $18 billion through sales in 2024, a ninefold jump from last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. More specifically, utilities are turning to hybrid bonds, an emerging category within the asset class. Part of the shift is being driven by a Moody’s Ratings methodology change whereby hybrids can be treated as half-debt and half-equity, so companies carry less debt on their balance sheet than if they had sold a regular bond. “There’s going to be more energy needed whether you’re talking about cars, whether you’re talking about data centers,” said Mark Lieb, a near five-decade veteran of preferred securities and chief executive officer at Spectrum Asset Management Inc. “You have all these different segments that seem to be converging together.” Power generators and infrastructure firms are bracing for electricity demand to outstrip supply during the next few years after a period of flat or shrinking consumption, with data centers accounting for the bulk of the increase, according to Bain & Co. Meeting these needs would require utilities to boost annual generation by as much as 26% by 2028, the consulting firm said. Capital expenditure is set to exceed $200 billion next year, almost double the amount of a decade ago, according to trade group Edison Electric Institute. For utilities faced with big financing needs, the change in Moody’s ratings methodology in February made hybrids more cost-effective to raise debt without risking rating downgrades. Companies could now classify 50% of capital raised through hybrids as equity, an increase from 25%, in addition to benefitting from deducting interest payments for tax purposes. Prior to the change, utilities would’ve generally issued preferred stocks, another category within subordinated securities that are usually sold by banks. Hybrid bonds that fit Moody’s criteria typically mature in 30 years and can be repaid five or 10 years after issuance. “It’s fascinating because utility capital expenditure is going through the roof, so they need to finance it,” said Andy DeVries, head of utilities at CreditSights Inc. “Right as capex is going up with the data centers, Moody’s comes with a gift from above.” For investors, hybrids can offer yields that rival the returns of junk-rated bonds, even though the instruments are usually issued by high-grade firms. These yields would help support further strong demand as investors look for investment opportunities in a lower Federal Reserve interest-rate environment, said Doug Baker, head of preferred securities at Nuveen. “We see potential for demand to actually increase, as that dynamic shifts away from investors parking in cash as the Fed cuts and looking to invest it in a better opportunity,” Baker said. “This is one of those areas where we would expect to see that cash to rotate into.” Hybrid bonds are still fairly new in the US, where the market is underdeveloped compared to Europe. They would typically also take losses ahead of other bonds if a company goes under. In Europe, for example, where perpetual hybrids are the widespread format, a funding crunch faced by Swedish real estate firm SBB prompted a selldown in the firm’s hybrid bonds to mere cents in the euro. Utilities are well-suited to raise funding through hybrids because the industry is mostly regulated, making firms’ performance fairly easy to predict, said Linus Claesson, a portfolio manager specializing in corporate hybrids at Neuberger Berman. Telecommunications companies and pipeline operators have the same profile, making these sectors suitable for participation too, he said. You “actually prefer to have fairly capital intensive businesses that are reliant on the public bond market to fund themselves,” Claesson said. “That means the reputational considerations, when it comes to using the optionality embedded in the instrument, becomes very relevant.” This year’s growth in hybrid supply is set to be only the beginning as power providers set the groundwork for the splurge that would be required for the AI era. The sector is also unlikely to encounter headwinds from a Donald Trump-led US administration, said Brittney D. Sandler, a senior associate at law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP. “Demand for data center capacity, resilient infrastructure, and advanced, scalable solutions will continue to grow,” said Sandler, who advises on corporate finance transactions. “Our clients are full speed ahead.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Jaylen Brown Is Taking On Nike With $200 Sneakers Trump and the Triumph of America’s New Elite Trump’s Impossible Task: Delivering for the Working Class and Billionaires Companies With Immigrant Workforces Are Preparing for Raids Deep in the Jungle, Virus Hunters Are Working to Stop the Next Pandemic ©2024 Bloomberg L.P.","(Bloomberg) -- The intelligence is driving such insatiable quest for cash that it’s rewiring one section of capital markets.

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting NYC Mayor Adams Names Jessica Tisch to Lead Police Head Amid Probes Hackers accessed edge-routing infrastructure and gained unauthorized access to a limited number of devices, including a T-Mobile-owned-and-operated router, according to the people, who asked not to be identified discussing nonpublic information. When T-Mobile detected the suspicious activity, it booted the hackers from its systems. The company detected reconnaissance activity aimed at reaching deeper layers of the network, but customer data wasn’t accessed because T-Mobile caught the intrusion at such an early stage, the people said. T-Mobile knows where the intruders entered its network and is highly confident the method used for access is gone, the people said. The attack shared some characteristics with intrusions by Salt Typhoon, a Chinese hacking group that has targeted US telecommunications networks in recent weeks. T-Mobile hasn’t identified the responsible party. The people couldn’t identify the hackers and didn’t say when the intrusion took place. US officials said last week that Chinese state-sponsored hackers perpetrated a “broad and significant cyber-espionage campaign” in which they breached multiple telecommunications companies to steal customer call records and compromise communications belonging to a “limited number” of people in government and politics. The hackers targeted Vice President Kamala Harris’ staff, President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance, as well as staffers for Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, according to Missouri Republican Senator Josh Hawley. “To the extent we know, they were successful perhaps in garnering at least some of the communications of these individuals and their staff,” Hawley said at a hearing Tuesday. China has denied the allegations, with Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian saying last week that his nation had “no interest in interfering in other countries’ internal affairs through cyberspace.” “We also oppose spreading China-related disinformation due to political agenda,” he said at a regular press briefing in Beijing. The Wall Street Journal reported on Nov. 15 that Bellevue, Washington-based T-Mobile’s systems were among those hacked. The newspaper previously reported that AT&T Inc., Verizon Communications Inc. and Lumen Technologies Inc. were among those targeted in the Salt Typhoon campaign. A day later, a T-Mobile spokesperson confirmed that the company was among those breached by Chinese hackers. “We have not seen significant impacts to T-Mobile systems or data, and have no evidence of impacts to or exfiltration of any customer information,” the company said in an email. Cisco Systems Inc. routers were involved in the breaches at AT&T, according to a person familiar with the matter. The attackers manipulated settings to siphon off the information they wanted, the person said. Most of the activity the carrier has found is on the routers, but they are such big networks it’s not clear if all the activity has been detected.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/doj-push-google-sell-chrome-222920497.html,"Tue, Nov 19, 2024, 2:44 PM","(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc.’s Chrome browser could go for as much as $20 billion if a judge agrees to a Justice Department proposal to sell the business, in what would be a historic crackdown on one of the world’s biggest tech companies. Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting NYC Mayor Adams Names Jessica Tisch to Lead Police Head Amid Probes The department will ask the judge, who ruled in August that Google illegally monopolized the search market, to require measures related to artificial intelligence and its Android smartphone operating system, according to people familiar with the plans. Antitrust officials, along with states that have joined the case, also plan to recommend Wednesday that federal judge Amit Mehta impose data licensing requirements, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing a confidential matter. If Mehta accepts the proposals, they have the potential to reshape the online search market and the burgeoning AI industry. The case was filed under the first Trump administration and continued under President Joe Biden. It marks the most aggressive effort to rein in a technology company since Washington unsuccessfully sought to break up Microsoft Corp. two decades ago. Owning the world’s most popular web browser is key for Google’s ads business. The company is able to see activity from signed-in users, and use that data to more effectively target promotions, which generate the bulk of its revenue. Google has also been using Chrome to direct users to its flagship AI product, Gemini, which has the potential to evolve from an answer-bot to an assistant that follows users around the web. Should a sale proceed, Chrome would be worth “at least $15-$20 billion, given it has over 3 billion monthly active users,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mandeep Singh. The price prospective buyers are willing to pay may depend on their ability to link Chrome to other services, said Bob O’Donnell of TECHnalysis Research. “It’s not directly monetizable,” he said. “It serves as a gateway to other things. It’s not clear how you measure that from a pure revenue-generating perspective.” Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google’s vice president of regulatory affairs, said the Justice Department “continues to push a radical agenda that goes far beyond the legal issues in this case.” She added, “the government putting its thumb on the scale in these ways would harm consumers, developers and American technological leadership at precisely the moment it is most needed.” The Justice Department declined to comment. Chrome Access Antitrust enforcers want the judge to order Google to sell off Chrome because, as the most widely used browser worldwide, it represents a key access point through which many people use its search engine, the people said. The government has the option to decide whether a Chrome sale is necessary at a later date if some of the other aspects of the remedy do not create a more competitive market, the people added. The Chrome browser controls about 61% of the market in the US, according to StatCounter, a web traffic analytics service. Government attorneys met with dozens of companies over the past three months as they prepared the recommendation. States are still considering adding some proposals and some details could change, the people said. The antitrust officials pulled back from a more severe option that would have forced Google to sell off Android, the people said. Alphabet’s Google Bracing for Antitrust Rigmarole: Legal Outlook The benefit of Chrome, which Google doesn’t charge for directly, is partially in the convenience it provides users, by making their experience with Google products more seamless, said Eric Schmidt, former Google CEO, on CNBC. “Breaking up these companies is not going to fundamentally address the annoyance you have with them.” Google said in a blog post that if other companies owned Chrome, they wouldn’t have the incentive to invest as heavily in it or keep it free, and would likely have to change its business model. Google Appeal Mehta’s August ruling that Google broke antitrust laws in both online search and search text ads markets followed a 10-week trial last year. The company has said it plans to appeal. The judge has set a two-week hearing in April on what changes Google must make to remedy the illegal behavior and plans to issue a final ruling by August 2025. The agency and the states have settled on recommending that Google be required to license the results and data from its popular search engine and give websites more options to prevent their content from being used by Google’s artificial intelligence products, said the people. The antitrust enforcers are set to propose that Google uncouple its Android smartphone operating system from its other products, including search and its Google Play mobile app store, which are now sold as a bundle, the people said. They are also prepared to seek a requirement that Google share more information with advertisers and give them more control over where their ads appear. Lawyers from the Justice Department and state attorneys general included all of those options in an initial filing in October, as well as a ban on the type of exclusive contracts that were at the center of the case against Google. A forced spinoff, if it happens, would also hinge on finding an interested buyer. Those who could afford and might want the property, like Amazon.com Inc., are also facing antitrust scrutiny that may prevent such a mega-deal. “My view is this is extremely unlikely,” Singh said in an email. But, he added, he could see a buyer like OpenAI, the maker of artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT. “That would give it both distribution and an ads business to complement its consumer chatbot subscriptions.” A merger with a US-based AI player may more easily pass government scrutiny than another tech giant, said Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, digital advertising and media analyst at Emarketer. It “could conceivably be approved by the government as a way to prioritize AI innovation and US posturing around AI on the global stage.” AI Overviews Google now displays artificial intelligence-based answers at the top of its search pages billed as “AI Overviews.” While websites can opt-out of having their information used by Google to create AI models, they can’t afford to opt out of the overviews because that would risk pushing them down in search results, making it harder to reach their customers. Website publishers have complained that the feature dampens traffic and advertising dollars since users rarely click through to see the data being used to power those results. Earlier: Google’s AI Search Gives Sites Dire Choice: Share Data or Die Regarding data licensing, the antitrust enforcers plan to propose two options: That Google sell the underlying “click and query” data and also separately syndicate its search results, according to the people. The company currently sells syndicated search results, but with restrictions, such as preventing their use on mobile. Forcing Google to syndicate its search results would allow rival search engines and AI startups to quickly improve their quality, while the data feed would allow others to build their own search index. --With assistance from Nick Turner, Davey Alba and Julia Love.

The tech giant showed off a number of improvements to its Microsoft 365 Copilot platform, including new AI agents; said that it’s previewing the use of Nvidia’s (NVDA) Blackwell GB200-powered AI servers; and announced a slew of security upgrades for its systems. Shares of Microsoft were flat immediately following the announcements. The software behemoth also touted its customer growth in the AI space. Microsoft chief communications officer Frank Shaw noted in a statement that “nearly 70% of the Fortune 500 now use Microsoft 365 Copilot.” Microsoft, like its Big Tech rivals, is pouring billions of dollars into expanding its AI capabilities, and Wall Street is eager to see those investments pay off. Microsoft’s latest AI updates include what it calls Copilot Actions. Available in private preview, the feature can do things like provide users with summaries of their daily meetings or, more importantly, summaries of all the emails and notes they received while away on vacation. Doing away with the daylong pain of catching up on emails alone might just make Copilot Actions worthwhile. Microsoft is also going all in on AI agents. Think of AI agents as a more advanced version of an AI chatbot. Where chatbots can only respond to user prompts with text, AI agents are designed to perform automated tasks like taking meeting notes or, on the more advanced side, help companies process customer proposals and requests. New AI agents include Interpreter for Teams, which will translate voice conversations in real time with the option to simulate the sound of your voice, and Employee Self-Service Agent, which is meant to help workers find important answers to questions about HR or IT issues. The Windows maker also showed off its Azure AI Foundry software development kit (SDK), which is meant to help companies build and manage their own AI apps and agents, and the Azure AI Foundry Agent Service, which allows developers to put together AI agents to automate different business processes. In addition to software, Microsoft is making hardware moves with the debut of its Windows 365 Link. A small PC designed to access Microsoft’s cloud services, the Link will be available in April 2025 for $349. The company also said it’s previewing the use of Nvidia’s (NVDA) GB200 servers to provide customers with access to AI-optimized virtual machines and cloud-based computers that users can use to perform AI training and inferencing. Microsoft is one of a number of companies looking to get their hands on Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell chips, which power the GB200. By previewing the platform, Microsoft is a step closer to being able to offer the service to its customers. On the security front, Microsoft announced its new Microsoft Security Exposure Management platform. The software is designed to give cybersecurity experts a better overall look at how employee devices, files, and services come together and overlap, helping them understand how a hacker might be able to gain access to a business and move through its networks. The idea is that by giving cybersecurity workers a view into how attackers might try to access networks, the workers will be able to cut hackers off ahead of time or at least respond to threats more quickly. Microsoft says it’s also moving to improve the security of AI apps with its Data Loss Prevent for Microsoft 365 Copilot. The company says the feature will let customers see if AI prompts are pulling up sensitive data, prevent data risks, and provide information about how to respond to AI-related security incidents. Microsoft’s announcements come as the company is looking to fully monetize its AI investments over the last few years, including its stake in ChatGPT developer OpenAI. Microsoft reported better-than-expected Q1 earnings in October and said that AI contributed 12 points of growth to its Azure cloud business segment. Shares of Microsoft are up 12% over the last 12 months. Shares of rivals Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) are up 39% and 27%, respectively. Correction: The Windows 365 Link is priced at $349.

The end date will be Jan. 31 for employees in those positions. Some other jobs will be “transitional” and needed for three to 12 months to support the integration on a fixed short-term basis, the company said in the presentation. Salesforce, the top maker of customer relations software, announced the deal in September. Own said Monday on LinkedIn that the acquisition had closed. A Salesforce spokesperson declined Tuesday to comment on the workforce reductions. The immediately planned job cuts underscore Salesforce’s tighter approach to acquisitions after years of rapid expansion. Big mergers like Slack in 2021 or Tableau in 2019 added thousands of workers to overall headcount, fueling expenses and technical complexity. Salesforce’s penchant for growth through deals came under fire from activist investors starting in late 2022, leading the company to make changes such as disbanding its mergers and acquisitions committee and cutting 10% of its workforce early last year. San Francisco-based Salesforce has said it would take a more prudent approach to future purchases. Own, which focuses on securing data across software applications, is Salesforce’s biggest acquisition since Slack. The $1.9 billion merger includes about 1,000 workers at Own, according to a person familiar with the firm who asked not to be named discussing internal numbers. Most analysts see Own bolstering Salesforce’s Data Cloud offering, which helps customers organize and analyze information across apps. Separately, Salesforce said earlier this month that it would be hiring more than 1,000 people to help sell its new generative AI agent product.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/smuggled-code-executive-admission-heated-130452708.html,"Tue, Nov 19, 2024, 5:04 AM","(Bloomberg) -- A former executive at StoneX Group Inc. admitted to stealing trade secrets from his prior employer BTIG LLC, a surprise twist in a bitter battle between the rival brokerage firms. Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting NYC Mayor Adams Names Jessica Tisch to Lead Police Head Amid Probes Evan Pfeuffer, who was a managing director at StoneX Financial, said he and others stole technology including sensitive computer code, software and business ideas from BTIG so that StoneX could set up sophisticated automated trading tools. He was told to do so by StoneX management, both during his recruitment and after the firm hired him, he alleged in an affidavit seen by Bloomberg News. “Like others, I smuggled code out of BTIG in ways carefully designed to avoid detection by BTIG’s security and compliance monitoring,” Pfeuffer said in the affidavit. “StoneX’s management instructed us to copy code, product designs, and whatever else was needed so that we could avoid the years it would otherwise take to build StoneX’s systems and products from scratch.” Pfeuffer’s revelation comes amid an ongoing dispute between the two firms. BTIG had sued StoneX for at least $200 million in compensation alleging it pilfered code to build its own market-making business. BTIG claimed that StoneX recruited several of its key traders and software developers, some of whom took the stolen code with them to StoneX under the instruction of senior executives. The lawsuit has since moved to arbitration — a private method of resolving disagreements. Bitter battles involving accusations of trade secret theft are proliferating, as financial firms increasingly rely on algorithms and technology to gain an edge. Citadel Securities sued a pair of former employees alleging they stole trade secrets last year after they broke off to form a crypto market-making firm — a claim that firm denies. Jane Street Group accused former traders of taking confidential trading strategy to new jobs at Izzy Englander’s Millennium Management, which they also deny. In the affidavit, Pfeuffer said StoneX’s management encouraged him to enlist additional colleagues from BTIG despite knowing this violated non-compete agreements. At StoneX, Pfeuffer’s team was under “enormous pressure” to use stolen BTIG intellectual property to modernize its lagging technology, after the firm made unrealistic promises to shareholders that it could deliver automated trading systems within a year, Pfeuffer said. StoneX’s senior executives — including StoneX Financial Chief Executive Officer Charles Lyon, its head of equities Jacob Rappaport, head of equity trading Thomas Moore and managing director Chris Amato — were “intimately involved” in these activities, Pfeuffer alleged in the affidavit, dated Oct. 9 and submitted in the arbitration. Lawyers representing both StoneX and those executives said in an emailed statement that the affidavit contains misstatements, misrepresentations and speculation. It also contradicts a statement signed by Pfeuffer in 2021 which was filed in a California court as an exhibit in the lawsuit, the lawyers said. In that document, Pfeuffer denied possessing BTIG code and providing it to StoneX. “We will continue to vigorously defend against BTIG’s baseless allegations against the company and its executives,” the lawyers said. Pfeuffer was placed on leave by StoneX in January, he said in the affidavit. He no longer works at the firm, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private information. Steven Kalar, the lawyer representing Pfeuffer in the matter, declined to comment on the affidavit and declined to give a reason for Pfeuffer’s admission. Representatives for BTIG also declined to comment. Aggressive Recruitment Pfeuffer joined StoneX in early February 2021, days after resigning from BTIG. His appointment followed a months-long recruitment process which involved multiple calls with senior management and the promise of millions of dollars in bonuses, he said in the affidavit. Pfeuffer said he got a “very aggressive pitch” from Amato, who also previously worked at BTIG. Pfeuffer told Amato that if he jumped ship, he wanted to bring his BTIG partner, Debayan Bhaduri, with him. Pfeuffer said Bhaduri had extensive knowledge of the order-management system StoneX was using — the digital tool that executes and tracks securities orders. Both were unhappy at BTIG at that time over their expected compensation, according to Pfeuffer. In one instance in December 2020, Pfeuffer and Bhaduri flew to meet StoneX executives including Lyon, Moore and Rappaport in Winter Park, Florida — where it has an office — to discuss moving to the firm and ways to upgrade its systems. The executives encouraged them to recruit additional BTIG employees, but only after a lull to avoid the appearance of solicitation, according to Pfeuffer. He was promised a $300,000 base salary with a $200,000 bonus during his first year, but was told such incentives could surpass $2 million if the StoneX systems were successful. Once at StoneX, Pfeuffer said he and colleagues faced deadlines to build new automated trading systems that were “completely unrealistic” without using information from previous employers. StoneX management made it clear that if staff remembered something from prior employment, they could use it at StoneX. Amato made comments about “coding from memory,” which employees understood to mean cribbing such ideas, Pfeuffer said. An attorney for Amato declined to comment on pending litigation. Complaints, Lawsuits In BTIG’s lawsuit, which it filed against StoneX in November last year, it alleged the firm stole code and poached BTIG executives. In a May filing, StoneX said it would “vigorously defend itself” against the claims. At that time, StoneX also disclosed that the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission were investigating the firm for conduct alleged in BTIG’s complaint. Pfeuffer’s affidavit was also submitted as part of that process, according to the people familiar with the matter. A representative for the SEC said the agency doesn’t comment on investigations or the existence of them. A representative for the Justice Department declined to comment. In addition to StoneX, BTIG has brought claims against a number of individuals including former BTIG employees Amato and Bhaduri. Its complaints against Amato and Bhaduri, filed in June in Chicago and New York federal courts, claim the individuals were key perpetrators of what it called “one of the greatest financial-industry trade secret frauds in recent history.” The parties agreed to arbitrate before the defendants were due to publicly respond. BTIG has not brought claims against Pfeuffer, according to the people familiar with the matter. Amato recruited a team of BTIG executives to steal the code, BTIG alleged, while Bhaduri used stolen code to build new automated market-making and trading tools, according to the complaints against them. In his affidavit, Pfeuffer said that Bhaduri discussed the possibility of fleeing the US for India to avoid prosecution. “Mr. Bhaduri categorically denies ever taking trade secrets from BTIG, and he also categorically denies talking about fleeing to India or expressing concern about being arrested for taking information from BTIG,” David Axelrod, a lawyer for Bhaduri, said in an emailed statement. ‘Perfected’ Method Pfeuffer said he had “perfected” his method for inconspicuously stealing code while he worked at BTIG, which he had joined in 2015. First, he would manually type out encryption software on BTIG’s code-development servers and use that software to encrypt the code he wanted to remove. The measures made it appear “as meaningless gobbledy-gook,” he said. He then appended the encrypted code to an “innocent looking” PDF he had saved to BTIG’s servers before ultimately emailing it to his personal Gmail account. “I realize that what I did was wrong and am very remorseful for my conduct,” he said. --With assistance from Ava Benny-Morrison, Lydia Beyoud, Nicola M.

Cherney SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft has designed two additional infrastructure chips for its data centers that will help speed artificial intelligence operations and increase data security, it said on Tuesday at its Ignite conference. Microsoft has devoted significant resources to develop home-grown silicon for general purpose applications and artificial intelligence. Like rivals Amazon.com and Google, Microsoft's engineers say there is a performance and price benefit to designing chips that are customized for its needs. Designing custom chips can reduce Microsoft's reliance on processors made by Intel and Nvidia. Microsoft's two new chips are designed to be installed deep within the company's data center infrastructure. One chip is designed to increase security and the other is for data processing. The company makes the effort to design an array of data center processors because it aims to ""optimize every layer of infrastructure"" and ensures that Microsoft's data centers crunch information at the speed AI requires, said Rani Borkar, corporate vice president, Azure Hardware Systems and Infrastructure Engineers will install the new security chip called the Azure Integrated HSM in every new server destined for a data center beginning next year. The chip aims to keep crucial encryption and other security data inside the security module. The data processing unit, or DPU, aims to move multiple components of a server into a single chip that is focused on cloud storage data. The company said it can run these specific tasks at three times less power and four times the performance compared with its current hardware.

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting NYC Mayor Adams Names Jessica Tisch to Lead Police Head Amid Probes “I think we absolutely have to make the testing mandatory, but we also need to be really careful about how we do it,” Amodei said in response to a question on the topic Wednesday at an AI safety summit in San Francisco hosted by the US Departments of Commerce and State. Amodei’s remarks came after the US and UK AI Safety Institutes released the results of their testing of Anthropic’s Claude 3.5 Sonnet model in a range of categories, including for cybersecurity and biological capabilities. Anthropic, along with rival OpenAI, had previously agreed to submit their AI models to the government groups. Amodei noted there is a patchwork of voluntary, self-imposed safety guidelines that major companies have agreed to, such as Anthropic’s responsible scaling policy and OpenAI’s preparedness framework, but he said more explicit requirements are needed. “There’s nothing to really verify or ensure the companies are really following those plans in letter of spirit. They just said they will,” Amodei said. “I think just public attention and the fact that employees care has created some pressure, but I do ultimately think it won’t be enough.” Amodei’s thinking is partly informed by his belief that more powerful AI systems that can outperform even the smartest human beings could come as soon as 2026. While AI companies are testing for biological threats and other catastrophic harms that are still hypothetical, he stressed these risks could become real very quickly. At the same time, Amodei cautioned that testing requirements should remain “flexible” to account for how quickly the technology is changing. “We’re going to have to solve for a very difficult socio-political problem,” he said.

Brent crude futures for January were down 1 cent, or 0.01%, at $73.30 a barrel by 12:19 p.m. ET (1719 GMT). U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures for December, due to expire on Wednesday, were up 17 cents, or 0.24%, at $69.56, while the more active WTI contract for January was up 5 cents, or 0.07%, at $69.29. The intensifying war between Russia and Ukraine and subsequent concern around potential oil supply disruptions have helped keep a floor under prices this week. ""These risks to supply are definitely keeping the support here and offsetting to a degree concerns around the global demand outlook,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital in New York. Ukraine fired a volley of British Storm Shadow cruise missiles into Russia on Wednesday, the latest new Western weapon it has been permitted to use on Russian targets a day after it fired U.S. ATACMS missiles. This has put geopolitical risk back in the market, StoneX energy analyst Alex Hodes said in a note on Wednesday. ""However, the concerns over additional sanctions or disruptions of Russian fuel or crude oil supplies appear misguided,"" Hodes added, pointing to strong Russian fuel exports. Long positions in WTI have declined significantly despite the added geopolitical risk, according to Aegis Hedging associate Christian Drolshagen, with hedge funds holding only 50% of summer levels, per CFTC data. Elsewhere, the U.S. vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution for a ceasefire in Gaza on Wednesday, buoying oil prices' war risk premium on investors concerns around potential disruptions to global oil supplies as war in the Middle East continues. ""The market is very nervous something could happen with another escalation between the Israelis and Iranians,"" said Again Capital's Kilduff. ""Everyone is focused on Trump and U.S. producers being let loose, but the flip side of that is that sanctions are definitely back in the market as far as what happens next with Iranian supplies and its ability to export,"" he added. Offsetting some support from supply concerns on Wednesday, U.S. crude and gasoline stocks rose by more than expected last week, according to data from the Energy Information Administration. Elsewhere, Norway's Equinor said it had restored full output capacity at the Johan Sverdrup oilfield in the North Sea following a power outage. Equinor last month said the field was producing at peak capacity of around 755,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve will trim interest rates next month but make shallower cuts in 2025 than expected just a month ago due to the risk of higher inflation from President-elect Donald Trump's proposed policies, according to most economists in a Reuters poll. Higher interest rates increase the cost of borrowing, which can slow economic activity and dampen demand for oil.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/factbox-taxes-could-help-raise-152049630.html,"Tue, Nov 19, 2024, 7:20 AM","BAKU (Reuters) - The COP29 climate talks in Azerbaijan aim to agree an annual finance target of $1 trillion or more a year to help poorer countries respond to global warming. Some see new taxes as one way to get there. The Global Solidarity Levies Task Force (GSLT), led by France, Barbados and Kenya, is exploring the issue. Below are extracts from its latest report on the options being discussed and estimates about how much could be raised. SHIPPING The levy that could be closest to being agreed is for shipping, responsible for around 3% of global emissions, with governments set to debate a series of measures at a meeting of the International Maritime Organization in April. Models for a levy include a Pacific islands and Caribbean proposal for a flat rate of $150/ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), rising every five years, the GSLT said. The European Union and Japan favour a levy of $100/ton in 2027, while countries including Bahamas and Liberia have proposed an initial flat rate of about $18.75/ton. A levy of $150-300/ton could generate $127 billion a year in 2027-2030, the GSLT said, citing a study by U.N. Trade and Development. Revenue would fall to $103 billion in 2031-2040 and $36 billion in 2041-2050 as ships became less polluting. AVIATION Aviation accounts for 2% of global emissions yet is usually free of value-added tax (VAT) or sales taxes. Levies being discussed by the GSLT include kerosene fuel, private jet fuel, luxury tickets and frequent flyers, which together could generate $19 billion to $164 billion a year, it estimates. Around 29 countries already tax aviation fuel through excise duties, carbon levies or emission permits. The average price among G20 countries in 2021 was 9 euros ($9.50) per ton. Hurdles to a broader tax include ensuring a level playing field for industry players and overcoming legal barriers. At least 21 countries also already have some form of levy on airline tickets, at rates ranging from 2 euros in Portugal to almost 500 euros on some flights out of Britain, the GSLT said. FOSSIL FUELS Countries already impose levies on fossil fuels, including indirectly when gasoline is bought at the pump, through VAT, carbon taxes or emissions-trading schemes, or via royalties or taxes on oil companies. GSLT said revenues could be generated in future through a levy on extraction or ""windfall"" taxes on energy company profits. A ""Climate Damages Tax"" of $5/ton extracted in 2024 would generate an estimated $216 billion, a Greenpeace report this year said. An ActionAid report said a 50% tax on the windfall profits of the biggest 14 fossil fuel companies by market value in the two years to July 2023 would have generated around $173 billion. FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS More than 30 countries have some form of levy on financial transactions including Britain, France, Italy and Spain although agreeing a cross-border levy has proved tough. The Austrian Institute of Economic Research estimates a 0.1% levy on trading stocks and bonds and a 0.01% rate on derivatives trades globally could raise $238 billion to $419 billion a year. CARBON The GSLT says there are currently 75 carbon pricing mechanisms across 83 jurisdictions, of which 36 are structured as emissions trading systems (ETS) and 39 as carbon taxes. In total, they cover 24% of global emissions. But most are priced more cheaply than the $40-$80 a ton needed to keep the world on track to rein in global warming, due to political concern about the impact on households and businesses. A plan proposed by the International Monetary Fund would see countries agree a minimum price of $50 a ton, or of $25, $50 and $75 a ton varying with the stage of a country's development. The GSLT said another option could be to link up existing trading schemes. WEALTH The Group of 20 largest economies this year discussed whether to raise taxes on the super-rich. A report backed by current G20 leader Brazil proposed a global minimum tax of 2% of wealth for the world's roughly 3,000 dollar-billionaires, to raise about $250 billion a year. Other options could include changing the threshold at which the tax kicks in and the rate at which it is applied. CRYPTO Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are created by computation power driven by energy usage that creates emissions. In 2022, Kazakhstan moved to charge crypto miners between 1 and 25 Tenge ($0.002-0.056) per kilowatt-hour, the GSLT said. A global tax on electricity use of $0.045 per kWh could raise $5.2 billion, the IMF has estimated. A levy on crypto trading at 0.1% could raise $15.8 billion while a capital gains tax of 20% could raise up to $323 billion, IMF research shows. PLASTICS Countries are set to meet in South Korea next week to agree a deal on reining in plastics pollution, with Ghana and others calling for a levy on producers of virgin plastic polymers. A fee of $60-90 per tonne on primary polymer production could raise $25-35 billion a year, the GSLT said, citing analysis from Australian non-profit the Minderoo Foundation.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/silicon-valley-tech-boom-lifts-202024401.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 12:20 PM","(Bloomberg) -- The rally in technology stocks has created so much wealth in California that it has helped the state fill its coffers. Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll NYC Mayor Adams Names Jessica Tisch to Lead Police Head Amid Probes California’s budget for the coming fiscal year is “roughly balanced,” the state’s Legislative Analyst’s Office said on Wednesday, citing a surge in corporate and personal-income tax revenue driven by Silicon Valley’s booming artificial intelligence and tech sectors, as well as changes to the tax code. “In the first half of 2024, stock pay alone at four major technology companies accounted for almost 10% of the state’s total income tax withholding,” the LAO said in a report. Those companies are Nvidia Corp, Alphabet Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Apple Inc. Because of its reliance on its richest people, California’s economy — which is considered among the largest in the world — is sensitive to extreme booms and busts. The top 1% of California earners pay nearly half of the state’s personal income-tax collections. A gauge of the so-called Magnificent Seven mega tech companies — Alphabet, Amazon.com Inc., Apple, Meta, Microsoft Corp., Nvidia and Tesla Inc. — is up 56% so far this year, more than twice the advance of the S&P 500 Index. “If sentiment around Nvidia were to change quickly, we could see a pretty significant reversal in the revenue gains that we’ve had over the last year or so,” said Brian Uhler, a deputy with the LAO. “It could be billions of dollars of revenue impacts from even just a correction in Nvidia’s stock.” The balanced budget projection comes after California’s legislature in June passed a $211 billion spending plan for the fiscal year that began July 1 that had to fill what was an estimated $27.6 billion shortfall. The Legislative Analyst’s Office report will help guide Governor Gavin Newsom and the state legislature to craft a budget for the upcoming fiscal year. Newsom’s initial budget proposal is expected in early January. Spending Versus Revenue California revenues were elevated by an unexpected corporate tax windfall that was injected into state coffers this summer, the LAO said. The forecast projects that tax collections are on track to beat expectations by $7 billion during the period starting July 1, 2023, and ending June 30, 2026. “Despite softness in the state’s labor market and consumer spending, earnings of high‑income Californians have surged in recent months,” the LAO said. “Income tax collections have seen a similar bounce. This recovery in income tax revenues is being driven by the recent stock market rally, which calls into question its sustainability in the absence of improvements to the state’s broader economy.” The influx of corporate tax revenue was likely the result of changes in state tax rules, including a suspension of the net-operating-loss deduction and a $5 million limit placed on how much businesses can claim for research and development. Despite the more positive picture, gains in the state’s spending is expected to outpace revenue growth. California expenditures are set to grow at a pace of 5.8% compared to 4% for revenues. “There’s really no new capacity for new commitments in our assessment here,” said Gabriel Petek, the legislative analyst for the state of California. The LAO assessment reflects deficit projections in the three budget cycles following next year. “We estimate there to be pretty significant operating deficits emerging in the range of $20 to $30 billion per year.” (Updates story with quote from press conference and details throughout.)

A source familiar with the trip confirmed Trump's plans after the Federal Aviation Administration on Monday issued temporary flight restrictions for ""VIP Movement"" over Brownsville, Texas, a practice that usually precedes a high-profile visit. Flight restrictions in place over Trump's oceanfront property in Palm Beach, Florida, will be lifted temporarily during the same timeframe. The Trump transition team did not respond to a request for comment about the president-elect's plans. A close friendship has developed between Trump and Musk, the Tesla CEO and world's richest man, who founded SpaceX in 2002. Musk has emerged as a close adviser to Trump and has stayed a lengthy stretch at his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach. The launch will be SpaceX's sixth test flight to space for Starship, the company's next-generation rocket system at the center of Musk's goal to send humans and cargo to Mars. NASA plans to use Starship to land people on the moon this decade under its Artemis program, an effort that is expected to more heavily involve Mars missions and favor SpaceX and Musk's cosmic plans under Trump. Using large arms attached to a launch tower, SpaceX will again try to catch Starship's 233 foot (71 metres)-tall first stage ""Super Heavy"" booster roughly 10 minutes after it lifts off, a novel reusability technique that intrigued Trump the first time SpaceX tried it in October.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exxon-mobil-signs-non-binding-110343615.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 3:03 AM","By Ernest Scheyder HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil said on Wednesday it has signed a non-binding lithium supply deal with battery parts maker LG Chem, the oil giant's second agreement to supply the electric vehicle battery metal from its proposed Arkansas project. Exxon last year announced plans to extract lithium from the Smackover Formation, an underground deposit of salty water known as brine that stretches from Florida through Arkansas and into Texas, using at least one type of direct lithium extraction (DLE) technology. Exxon and other oil companies such as Occidental Petroleum and Equinor are increasingly investing in lithium projects, partly due to their belief that extracting the metal from brine involves similar processes as petroleum extraction. The LG Chem agreement, which would require Arkansas officials to set a state lithium royalty rate to be finalized, is for up to 100,000 metric tons of the ultralight metal over several years. The move allows Exxon - which plans to self-fund its Arkansas project - to incorporate LG Chem's lithium quality specifications into its design plans. South Korea-based LG Chem plans to use the lithium at its Tennessee cathode facility, slated to open next year. ""This is about building a relationship with a company that has the same ambitions as building out the North American (battery) supply chain as us,"" Patrick Howarth, head of Exxon's lithium business, told Reuters. Exxon expects lithium demand to rise despite U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's campaign vow to end the ""EV mandate,"" Howarth said. ""We know that the world's going to need a lot more lithium than it's producing today,"" he said. Financial terms of the deal - including the price per metric ton of lithium that LG Chem would pay Exxon - would be negotiated as part of any final contract. SK On, a unit of SK Innovation, signed a non-binding lithium supply deal with Exxon in June. Despite recent lithium market turbulence, Howarth said Exxon has ""seen really strong support from our potential customer base."" ROYALTY Arkansas officials earlier this month rejected a proposed lithium royalty rate of 1.82% from Exxon and others. Officials have been debating a lithium royalty since at least 2018, with tension centering on how the metal should be valued given the cost for equipment to filter it from brine, which unlike oil typically has no intrinsic market value. Landowners want a higher rate, noting that most U.S. oil royalties pay between 8% and 12%. ""It's one of the key regulatory issues that we need to resolve to bring these projects to market,"" Howarth said, adding that Exxon could leave Arkansas - where it has invested more than $100 million - if the rate was too high. Officials hinted a 2.5% rate could be acceptable, which Howarth said would be ""in the range that we would be able to move forward."" Exxon would need to formally propose a new rate, which is likely in the near future, he added. Exxon declined to say how much lithium it expects to produce annually in Arkansas, although the amount would depend on which DLE technology it chooses. ""We're definitely narrowing down the selection,"" Howarth said. ""But we're still keeping multiple providers in play.""

Mortgage rates have been rising for the past month, testing an early July peak of 6.9% last week, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. Why? Renewed inflation risks tied to Trump's policy proposals lifted the benchmark Treasury bond yields that are used to set home borrowing costs. 💰💸 Don’t miss the move: SIGN UP for TheStreet’s FREE Daily newsletter 💰💸 Still, the MBA reported a modest pickup in purchase applications, helped in part by the lower rates offered to first-time buyers through the Federal Housing Administration loan program. ""For-sale inventory has loosened in some markets, and some potential buyers have been able to take advantage of increasing supply and lower FHA rates, which were down slightly in comparison to the conforming 30-year fixed rate,"" said the MBA's deputy chief economist, Joel Kan. Adam Gray/Getty Images The relentless rise in mortgage rates, which have surged more than three percentage points from pre-pandemic levels, has slashed the number of buyers able to afford homes in an increasingly expensive market. Related: Household debt is rising and it's causing psychological stress In fact, MBA data suggest that new mortgage applications, a key indicator of near-term demand, are at about half of November 2019's levels. The average home price, meanwhile, has risen by more than a third since November 2019, just before the pandemic, to around $425,000, further pressuring the overall cost for first-time buyers. Trump has vowed to loosen restrictions that he says are preventing the construction of new homes. In September, he told an event at the Economic Club of New York that he would ""eliminate regulations that drive up housing costs, with the goal of cutting the cost of a new home in half."" ""We’re going to open up our country to building homes inexpensively, so young people and other people can buy homes,"" he added. Related: Mortgage rate changes loom amid Fed rate cuts & Trump presidency Trump has also claimed that his proposal for mass deportations of illegal immigrants would lower housing costs by reducing overall demand. However, many have argued that the home construction sector relies heavily on the very labor he plans to eliminate. Housing starts are already in the doldrums, with single-family home construction falling 6.9% last month, according to the latest data from the Commerce Department. Permits for new construction, a key demand indicator that is much less influenced by the extreme weather that hurt housing starts, edged upward, hitting the highest level since April. ""Residential construction continues to trend downward, being weighed down by high mortgage rates and a softer job market,"" said Jeffery Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial in Charlotte. ""However, builders reported a recent uptick in traffic of prospective buyers, bolstering the near-term outlook for housing demand in the next six months."" Any move higher in mortgage rates, however, could temper that demand increase very quickly unless Washington takes clear and decisive action, argues CoreLogic's chief economist, Selma Hepp. ""High mortgage rates continue to hinder recovery; however, with homebuilder confidence gradually increasing, more newly built homes will make their way to market in 2025,"" she said. ""The incoming administration could push for more housing to be built, perhaps even making federal lands available for residential construction and potentially limiting regulatory barriers that have added considerable costs to new construction,"" Hepp added. Oliver Allen, senior U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, argued that mortgage costs will continue to blunt homebuying demand even at current rates. Related: CPI inflation sparks Fed interest rate cut bets ""The relatively high inventory of new homes for sale suggests that single-family construction probably will flatline at best over the coming months, and could easily start falling back again soon if mortgage rates remain around their current levels,"" he said. Realtor data show that the number of active listings last month rose to the highest level since December 2019, although the rise in mortgage rates held down the number of new listings. Homes are also taking a lot longer to sell, with an average of 58 days on the market, the slowest October pace in five years. The bigger impact, however, will likely come from lower mortgage rates, but markets can't bank on that just yet. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told investors last week that the central bank is in ""no hurry"" to lower overall borrowing costs. Stronger-than-expected readings for retail sales and Consumer Price Index inflation last month and Trump's tax and tariff proposals suggest renewed inflation risks over the coming months. CME Group's FedWatch, which tracks betting on Fed rate moves, pegs the odds of a December reduction at around 59%, down from around 85% just before the election. It also suggests fewer cuts next year, indicating a Federal Funds Rate of between 4% and 4.25% by June 2025, just a half point lower than its current level. Lower Fed rates, however, might not spill over into the mortgage market if the new Trump administration follows through on a promise to privatize mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.

However, it could also add to overall homebuying costs as the new private entities charge higher rates to compensate for the private capital they would need to support their balance sheets. And even a rapid sale wouldn't likely be completed until 2027, leaving markets focused on Fed rates and new-home supply in the near term. “Further interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve through 2025 should result in lower interest rates for construction and development loans, helping to lead to a stabilization for apartment construction and expansion for single-family homebuilding,” said Robert Dietz, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders.

The Q3 results, put out after the bell, did not prompt the massive sell-off some feared, with the AI chip leader’s stock dropping less than 2% in after-hours trading as management spoke to analysts on the call. Last quarter, a modest revenue and earnings beat was not enough to prevent a massive sell-the-news event, with the stock falling 18% in the week following the call. Some figured the stock could be due for another dip this time around with institutional investors eager to engage in profit-taking at the end the year. The stock held steady early Wednesday evening, however, as revenue jumped 94% year-over-year to $35.1 billion. The company’s January guidance also came in better than expected, with the chip maker indicating it is confident about the rollout of its next-generation Blackwell platform. “The age of AI is in full steam, propelling a global shift to NVIDIA computing,” Huang said in a press release. “Demand for Hopper and anticipation for Blackwell—in full production—are incredible as foundation model makers scale pretraining, post-training and inference.” When it comes to the stock’s short-term movement, investors might not be totally out of woods yet. Options trading ahead of the call implied a move just short of 8% in either direction, according to Bloomberg. That would roughly equate to a $300 billion swing in market value, bigger than the valuations of all but 24 of America’s largest companies. Regardless, shareholders have been massively rewarded, particularly if they bought before or around the release of ChatGPT in 2022 and subsequent GenAI boom. The stock has appreciate 800% over the last two years, with the company adding more than $3 trillion in market cap to trade places with Apple as the world’s largest company. Despite Nvidia’s growth running up against the law of large numbers, Wall Street appears optimistic about the stock continuing to reward investors. As of Wednesday afternoon, roughly 90% of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg (or 68 out of 76) had a buy rating on the stock, compared to 8% placing a hold and under 3% advising to sell. Based on recent earnings and the Street’s expectations, the stock is not incredibly expensive, either. Before the earnings call, the company’s blended price to earnings ratio sat just north of 36, per Bloomberg. That represented just a 24% premium to the semiconductor industry.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/duckduckgo-calls-eu-widen-digital-180609648.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 10:06 AM","Privacy-focused search engine DuckDuckGo has urged the European Union to widen its Digital Markets Act (DMA) investigation into Google, claiming the search giant is in breach of several areas where the bloc has yet to formally probe the company's compliance. The EU's flagship market contestability rulebook has been in force on a handful of tech giants since March, including Google. Fines for failing to abide by DMA rules that mandate things like platform access on FRAND (fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory) terms can reach up to 10% of global annual turnover on paper. So it's not a regulation Big Tech can just ignore. However we've yet to see any sanctions land, despite months of competitors accusing major platforms of flouting the law -- or, at best, engaging in so-called ""malicious compliance"". In a blog post published Wednesday, DuckDuckGo Senior Vice President for Public Affairs Kamyl Bazbaz set out several fresh charges, starting with accusing Google of a self-serving narrow interpretation of a DMA requirement to avoid sharing ""click-and-query"" data that could help competitors. The “Google European Search Dataset Licensing Program"", which was the company's response to the legal requirement to share click-and-query data, yields a data-set that DuckDuckGo says ""has little to no utility to competing search engines"" — largely, it argues, as a result of Google’s choice of anonymization method, which means only data from queries that have been searched more than 30 times in the last 13 months by 30 separate signed in users are included. ""This method is conveniently overbroad,"" DuckDuckGo wrote, suggesting that Google’s dataset ""would omit a staggering ~99% of search queries including 'longtail' queries that are the most valuable to competitors."" ""Google is trying to avoid its legal obligation in the name of privacy, which is ironic coming from the Internet’s biggest tracker,"" its blog post added. The Commission has set out a number of complaints against DMA gatekeepers and is working through non-compliance proceedings, including an investigation into Google's self preferencing, which kicked off in late March. But the EU's DMA probe of the search giant hasn't led to further public pronouncements, unlike in other Commission proceedings against Apple and Meta, where this summer the EU reached preliminary breach findings. Resource limitations may be one reason why the EU isn't moving as quickly as some had hoped. The DMA is an ex ante competition reform that some had even anticipated could be self-executing (i.e. dispensing with the need for regulatory enforcement), since it applies a set of up-front rules on in-scope tech giants. However while this year has seen a raft of changes made by platforms, which they claim as DMA compliance, many of their competitors remain unimpressed, accusing Big Tech of theatrics to try to avoid actually complying with the spirit of the law and piling pressure on the Commission to intervene. The EU, meanwhile, has limited resources to conduct this centralized enforcement. And avoiding spreading its staffers too thin may be one of the reasons why we haven't seen more-formal proceedings opened. DuckDuckGo's blog post lists two further complaints against Google that it's urging the Commission to investigate related to choice screens the regulation has forced the tech giant to implement in the EU in relation to its eponymous search engine and Chrome browser. The DMA requires that Google lets users easily switch from its own search and browser products to rivals' products as defaults. And the company has implemented choice screens in the EU as its response to this obligation. However, DuckDuckGo argues it has not delivered on what the regulation requires as it says it's still too arduous for users to switch. ""Before the DMA came into effect, it took more than 15 steps to switch your default search engine on Android, and today that is still the case,"" Bazbaz wrote. DuckDuckGo says the same is true for Chrome. ""Google has completely ignored its easy switching obligations under the DMA,"" he argued. ""As a result, we believe the Commission must launch a non-compliance investigation to get Google to fulfill its requirements under the law. 'Easy switching' should mean competition is actually one click away."" Discussing the impact of the Google search choice screen on DuckDuckGo's regional market share, Bazbaz told TechCrunch it is ""definitely"" seeing an increase in downloads on Android devices as a result of an improved design following the DMA coming into force. But since it has not yet been rolled out to all Google default users on Android, he said the impact on DuckDuckGo's total install base remains ""marginal."" ""So few users actually see it, and it’s not a permeant setting that facilities easy switching,"" he explained, adding: ""Compare that to the search engine choice screen rolled out on Chrome to their entire EEA [European Economic Area] user-base and we saw a 75% increase in search queries coming through Chrome."" The Commission has actually forced choice screens on Android since long before the DMA via classical competition enforcement against Google's mobile platform dating back to 2018. In that case, it took years of competitor complaints, and, finally, direct pressure from the EU, before Google ditched a pay-to-play auction for filling slots on the choice screen that rivals had warned fatally undermined the mechanism. Hence Google's regional marketshare for search remained much the same. The upshot is the Commission should be wise to Google tactics aimed at undermining the impact of competition remedies. But DuckDuckGo's point is EU enforcers risk looking asleep at the wheel again. Yet the DMA was supposed to avoid this kind of unwelcome deja vu. ""We have raised these issues with the Commission before privately and they indicated they are taking them seriously and looking into them,"" Bazbaz also told TechCrunch. ""That said, we believe launching formal investigations is likely the only way to force Google into compliance."" ""To comply with both the letter and the spirit of the DMA, we have consulted extensively with industry, experts, and the European Commission and made significant changes to our products,"" said Emily Clarke, a Google spokesperson.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) finished the day up about 0.3%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) closed flat. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped about 0.1%. All three major indexes had been deep in the red at some point in the day, with the Nasdaq down over 1% in morning trading. After the bell, Nvidia reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.81 on revenue of $35.1 billion. Analysts were anticipating EPS of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion but shares slipped early in after-hours trading. The $3.61 trillion chipmaker, now the world's most valuable company, had seen its stock surge 200% this year so far, hitting record highs after the US presidential election. Elsewhere in corporates, Target (TGT) muted its outlook for holiday-season sales and profit after posting a big quarterly profit miss and slashing its full-year guidance. The retail giant's shares sank more than 21% after the earnings. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices were up more than 3% to hit a fresh record near $94,500 per token before paring back some gains and falling below $94,000. Optimism for a crypto-friendly Trump White House has spurred the digital currency's recent rally. By subscribing, you are agreeing to Yahoo's Terms and Privacy Policy Nvidia (NVDA) stock slipped about 1% in after-hours trade after the company reported quarterly results that surpassed Wall Street's expectations for both earnings per share and revenue. For the third quarter, Nvidia reported earnings per share of $0.81 on revenue of $35.1 billion. Wall Street had expected earnings per share of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Nvidia shares had been up nearly 200% heading into the print. Target (TGT) stock fell more than 21% on Wednesday after the retail giant slashed its full-year guidance and missed Wall Street's estimates for both earnings per share and revenue in its third quarter. The Wednesday tumble marked the stock's worst one-day performance since May 2022. Read more about Target's quarter here. Homebuilder stocks are losing steam. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (XHB) has fallen nearly 5% in the past month. DR Horton (DHI), the biggest US homebuilder, along with Lennar (LEN) and PulteGroup (PHM), have seen declines of more than 12%, 6%, and 11% in the past month, respectively. “It's not surprising and not really alarming that the group is giving some of its [gains] back,” Wedbush analyst Jay McCanless told Yahoo Finance. “When you look at what mortgage rates have done in the past month, basically since the beginning of the calendar 4Q, these stocks tend to trade in an inverse fashion of what mortgage rates are doing.” Rates on the 30-year mortgages have been hovering around 6.7%, according to Freddie Mac, up from around 6% in September. Meanwhile, lumber prices have been climbing, with the framing lumber composite price rising 1.4% for the week ending Nov. 15, reaching the highest level since August 2023, according to the National Association of Home Builders. “It just may be a little more expensive from a lumber perspective for the builders than what they were paying this time last year,"" McCanless said. Nvidia's highly anticipated earnings report is set for release after the closing bell. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley breaks down the key numbers and themes to watch: Nvidia is expected to report Q3 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That works out to an 83% year-over-year increase on both the top and bottom lines compared to the same period last year when Nvidia saw EPS of $0.40 on revenue of $22.1 billion. Nvidia’s Data Center segment, its largest business, is set to bring in $29 billion for the quarter. That’s a 100% rise on the $14.5 billion reported in Q3 last year. Gaming revenue is expected to top out at $3 billion, up 7% from last year, when the segment brought in $2.8 billion. Analysts are anticipating gross margins to hit 75%. Investors will be on the lookout for not only whether Nvidia beats on the top and bottom lines for Q3 but also whether it raises its outlook for Q4. Analysts are expecting Nvidia to give guidance of $37 billion in revenue in the quarter. Read more of the preview here. Shares of the chipmaker Qualcomm (QCOM) dropped 6.6% following its investor day, which focused on how the company will diversify revenue just as its business with Apple (AAPL) falls into jeopardy. Qualcomm discussed further diversifying revenue beyond its smartphone chips to chips for personal computers, autos, and a range of advanced systems from machinery in factories to surveillance technology (dubbed its ""Internet of Things"" segment). Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman reports that the company expects to generate $22 billion in sales of those semiconductors by 2029. Currently about 10% of Qualcomm's revenue comes from sales of its modem chips to Apple for the iPhone, but that business has come under pressure as Apple increasingly develops its own custom chips for the devices. Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon spoke with Yahoo Finance about what's ahead for the company Tuesday afternoon. Read more here. Nvidia (NVDA) is set to report earnings after the bell and give investors another look at the state of AI spending. The stock is already up nearly 200% this year, and more than 2,600% in the past five years as the company's revenues have run wild amid a surge in demand for its AI chips. In a media roundtable on Wednesday, Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin made the case that it may be time for investors to look elsewhere to benefit from the AI boom. Nvidia's liftoff was ""phase one"" of the AI trade, Kostin said. The ""AI infrastructure"" trade, companies that will help power the AI boom and are spending on AI chips to operate new servers, has already taken off too, in some cases beyond their projected earnings growth, per Kostin. But the prices of stocks in Goldman's ""AI enabled revenue"" group haven't seen the same reaction. This group, Kostin said, could benefit from not having to spend as much on expensive AI hardware but still reap the potential benefits from AI as a whole. The group includes stocks like Uber (UBER), Adobe (ADBE), Mastercard (MA), Salesforce (CRM), and more. ""We at companies in the AI enabled revenue group of stocks where their performance of the shares have basically matched their earnings growth,"" Kostin said. ""And so our analysis is there's a potential for multiple expansion in those stocks."" Williams-Sonoma (WSM) shares soared roughly 30% after the company reported third quarter earnings that surpassed Wall Street's expectations and boosted its outlook for the full year. The high-end retailer — which owns Pottery Barn and West Elm in addition to its namesake, Williams-Sonoma — also said it's prepared to deal with potential upcoming tariffs under president-elect Donald Trump. CFO Jeffrey Howie said, ""We've significantly reduced our China-sourced goods from 50% to 25% over the last few years. So our exposure is significantly less than the last time in 2018 that we saw this activity."" ""The US is already a major manufacturing hub for Williams-Sonoma, Inc.,"" he added. ""Much of our upholstery is manufactured domestically in our facilities in North Carolina and Mississippi."" Howie continued, ""We're prepared to reduce our exports to China further if tariffs increase. We've mapped out a category-by-category plan to reduce China sourcing if conditions warrant, and we're currently evaluating and quantifying the impact from additional tariffs. We have a wide range of mitigation options."" Owning a home is becoming increasingly more expensive than renting one. Yahoo Finance's Claire Boston reports: Exact cost estimates vary, but recently the premium for homeownership has been at least 35% over renting, a level that’s near historical highs and is likely to persist. “We’re well, well beyond what the typical historical difference is if you were to buy an entry-level home versus rent a starter home,” said Rick Palacios Jr., director of research at John Burns Research and Consulting. “I think that’s a big part of why you see the resale market in a recession.” Palacios’s firm has found factors like rising homeowners insurance premiums explain much of the growing gap. Higher mortgage rates don’t help either. Leaving other factors constant, it would take mortgage rates to be at 3.5% for the buying versus renting math to return to historical averages.

On Wednesday, Federal Reserve governor Michelle Bowman expressed concern that the Fed’s progress toward 2% inflation has “stalled” and the central bank should proceed ""cautiously"" when lowering interest rates. Bowman was the lone official to dissent when the Fed slashed the rate by half a percentage point, saying then that the Fed should've cut interest rates by 25 basis points instead of 50. On Wednesday, she argued there are ""greater risks to the price stability side of our mandate, especially while the labor market remains near full employment."" ""We have seen considerable progress in lowering inflation since early 2023, but progress seems to have stalled in recent months,"" Bowman said in a speech at the Forum Club of the Palm Beaches. To Bowman's point, last week the ""core"" Consumer Price Index (CPI), which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, showed prices increased 3.3% annually for the third consecutive month during October. Recent data has increased debate over whether or not the Fed will cut rates in December. As of Wednesday afternoon, markets are pricing in a roughly 56% chance the Fed cuts rates in December, down from a more than 82% chance seen last week, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) has soared about 40% since Donald Trump won the presidential election to trade above $94,000 per coin for the first time on Wednesday. On Wednesday, Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz told Yahoo Finance why the market has been betting the new administration will be more pro cryptocurrency. ""All the guys around the table like our space,"" Novogratz said. ""They believe in the digital asset world. They believe in blockchains and bitcoin. And so the whole energy of this administration is going to be so different than the Elizabeth Warren, Gary Gensler era."" Novogratz added that he expects an administration that's more supportive of crypto will help US crypto business operate without the ""fear of litigation."" And for company's like Novogratz's it could help cut down on costs too. ""Our audit at Galaxy cost three times what it would if we were a non-crypto company,"" Novogratz said. ""So we're spending $9 million a year on an audit for a medium-sized company. That's insane. So the tax on crypto has been brutal. That is going to come way down. People aren't going to fear ... they're constantly getting a Wells notice."" Brutal day for Target (TGT) after earnings. Here are three problems I saw in the quarter. I wasn't the only one spotting these things, of course. The Citi research team swooping in with a midday downgrade on Target (a late one at that). ""We are downgrading Target from buy to neutral. Though 3Q may have had some unique challenges, we believe very poor results at Target in 3Q (and an uninspiring outlook for 4Q) show Target is likely losing share to Walmart (WMT). With Walmart's market share gains coming largely from higher income consumers (as they called out yesterday), Target seems to be the one most at risk of losing additional share. We believe Target is likely to need to be more promotional to drive traffic/sales, which we believe makes fiscal year 2025 much more uncertain, especially because in 3Q Target did not show an ability to adjust SG&A to offset the sales/gross margin weakness,"" said Citi analyst Paul Lejuez. Bottom line: It's going to take Target several quarters to regain investor trust. It could begin to do that by delivering on its severely lowered holiday quarter guidance. Walmart (WMT) and Lowe's (LOW) are the latest American retailers to warn that product costs could rise if President-elect Donald Trump makes good on his tariff promises — which include 10% to 20% tariffs across the board and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Walmart CFO John David Rainey hinted in an interview with Yahoo Finance’s Brian Sozzi on Tuesday that Trump’s tariff promises would prompt the retailer to hike costs, pointing to the impact of higher tariffs enacted during the president-elect's first term under his “America First” agenda. “If we look back historically when tariffs were enacted seven years ago, it did result in higher prices for customers,” Rainey said. Lowe's echoed the sentiment. “Roughly 40% of our cost of goods sold are sourced outside of the US, and that includes both direct imports and national brands through our vendor partners,” said CFO Brandon Sink in a call with investors on Tuesday. “And as we look at potential impact, certainly would add product costs, but timing and details remain uncertain at this point.” Read the full story here. Nvidia (NVDA) is set to report earnings on Wednesday after the bell. Expectations — as they have been for more than a year now — are monstrous. Nvidia is expected to report Q3 earnings per share of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Both metrics would mark a more than 80% increase compared to the same quarter a year ago. Nvidia has been consistently surpassing analyst estimates every quarter since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in November 2022. The AI chip leader's stock reaction has been more mixed in the day following earnings announcements as expectations have grown lofty, but it hasn't fallen two quarters in a row on the day following its earnings release since the middle of 2021. That could change during Thursday's trading day if Nvidia has a repeat of last quarter when the company's upbeat outlook wasn't enough to impress investors and the stock fell more than 6%. ""The company hasn’t had a negative price reaction in back to back post earnings release days since [the first quarter of 2021], when GenAI wasn’t a phrase in investors’ dictionary,"" Julian Emanuel, who leads the equity, derivatives, and quantitative strategy team at Evercore ISI, wrote in a note to clients on Sunday. ""A positive reaction following the 11/20 release, following the negative move last quarter, could help cushion the S&P 500’s decline somewhat near term but is more likely to refocus investors on the long term story."" Target (TGT) stock tanked in early trading on Wednesday, falling more than 20% after the retail giant slashed its full-year guidance and missed Wall Street's estimates for both earnings per share and revenue in its third quarter. Before the bell, Target said it now expects full-year earnings per share in a range of $8.30 to $8.90, below its prior range of $9.00 to $9.70. The new guidance also came in well below the $9.61 earnings per share that Wall Street had expected. The retailer also took a cautious stance on prospects for the holiday shopping season. Read more on Target's quarter from Yahoo Finance Executive editor Brian Sozzi here. US stocks wavered on Wednesday ahead of Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings, seen as a crucial litmus test for the AI trade that could set the direction of markets for days to come. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up about 0.2%, while the benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) hugged the flat line. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) slipped about 0.2%, following a mixed day on Wall Street on Tuesday. After surging on Tuesday amid increased optimism surrounding the stock ahead of earnings, Nvidia shares slid more than 1% in early trade. Comcast (CMCSA) is looking to play offense in the ever-evolving media landscape. On Wednesday, the company said that it will spin off most of its cable networks into a new publicly traded company called SpinCo. The stock jumped as much as 3.5% in premarket trading before paring those gains. The new venture will house the majority of NBCUniversal’s cable television networks, including USA Network, CNBC, MSNBC, Oxygen, E!, SYFY, and Golf Channel. Those networks collectively generated about $7 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, Comcast said in its announcement. Comcast's Peacock streaming service and the NBC broadcast network will remain under the parent company. “This transaction positions both SpinCo and NBCUniversal to play offense in a changing media landscape,” said Comcast president Mike Cavanagh.

Solomon said there was a belief that the Trump administration will pare back the level of regulation, and markets were responding to the idea that the new government would be pro-growth. Several business executives and investors have forecast an uptick in corporate dealmaking in 2025 on expectations that President-elect Trump would adopt a gentler approach toward mergers than his predecessor. Markets may also benefit from improving investor sentiment as the Federal Reserve potentially cuts interest rates further. However, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman called for a cautious approach to any further interest-rate cuts, saying that inflation remains a concern and the labor market is strong.

The bond-focused asset manager, with $2 trillion in assets, expects interest rate cuts by major central banks to boost both stocks and bonds going forward, with the two asset classes providing diversification by moving in opposite directions. However, it is also cautious on the trajectory of inflation, partly due to possible fiscal and trade policies under the impending new administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. ""Although restrictive central bank rates have brought inflation levels down close to targets, the long-term fiscal outlook in the U.S. includes continued high deficits, and geopolitical surprises could cause a spike in oil prices or snarl supply chains,"" portfolio managers Erin Browne and Emmanuel Sharef said in a note on Wednesday. ""Trade policies, such as tariffs, and deglobalization trends could also pressure inflation higher,"" they said. The Federal Reserve is largely expected to cut interest rates for the third consecutive time at its next rate-setting meeting in December. At the same time, recent strong economic data as well as expectations of inflationary policies under Trump, such as tariffs and a clamp down on illegal immigration, have prompted traders to trim bets on how deeply the U.S. central bank will be able to ease rates. PIMCO expects a so-called soft landing for the U.S. economy - a scenario where inflation keeps declining without an economic contraction - but it also favors strategies such as equity options to mitigate geopolitical and monetary policy risks.

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting NYC Mayor Adams Names Jessica Tisch to Lead Police Head Amid Probes The report alleges that “virtually every aspect of Oklo’s investment case warrants skepticism,” sending the stock down as much as 10%. Shares pared much of the decline and were down about 6% in midday trading in New York. Oklo shares have whip-sawed recently, rallying more than 20% this week through Tuesday’s close after falling 25% on Friday following its earnings release and the expiration of a lockup period that allows key investors like Peter Thiel’s venture capital firm to start selling shares. Oklo declined to comment. Since the company went public via a special purpose acquisition merger in May, its shares have soared more than 150%. “In classic SPAC fashion, Oklo has sold the market on inflated unit economics while grossly underestimating the time and capital it will take to commercialize its product,” the Kerrisdale report said. The company is among a wave of firms developing so-called small modular reactors that are expected to be built in factories and assembled on site. Advocates say the approach will make it faster and cheaper to build nuclear power plants, but the technology is unproven. Only a handful have been developed, and only in Russia and China. Oklo has said it expects its first system to go into service in 2027, but the Kerrisdale report highlights numerous technical and regulatory hurdles that may delay that schedule. Oklo is pursuing a new technology that it said will make its design safer and cheaper than conventional reactors in use today. The company’s design doesn’t have approval from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, a process that typically takes years. Wall Street is split on the company thus far. Of the four analysts covering Oklo, two have buy-equivalent ratings and two are neutral. The average price target implies about 5% return from where shares are trading.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-earnings-report-sends-stock-152914919.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 7:29 AM","Target could use some holiday cheer from shoppers after the retailer reported a decline in sales over the last three months – and expectations of a lackluster holiday shopping season. Shoppers didn't spend as much on apparel and other discretionary products such as furniture, appliances and electronics during the three-month period ending Nov. 2, 2024. However, sales of beauty products were up 6%. Target also forecast flat comparable sales during the current fourth quarter, which includes the holiday shopping season – a troublesome sign for the retail industry as a whole. During the third quarter, Target reported an increase in comparable sales of 0.3%, compared to a year ago, but that fell short of the average analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg. Sales at comparable stores fell 1.9%, while digital sales increased 10.8% during the quarter, the company said. It's a forecast that pales compared with Walmart's expected increase of 4.8%-to-5.1% in sales in the current quarter including the holiday shopping season, which the retailer announced Tuesday. Walmart earnings: Retailer projects fruitful holiday shopping season, stock jumps again ""Consumers continue to spend cautiously, most notably in discretionary categories,"" Target CEO Brian Cornell said in a conference call Wednesday while detailing the company's financial performance. Gas deal: Circle K offers 40 cents off all gas types before Thanksgiving: Here's when to get the deal Target shares plummeted 20% in early trading Wednesday. The sharp drop put the company's stock price down about 14% year-to-date. While the retailer saw an increase in store traffic, Cornell called the third quarter ""a volatile operating environment,"" in a statement included with the earnings results. ""We saw several strengths across the business, including a 2.4 percent increase in traffic, nearly 11 percent growth in the digital channel, and continued growth in beauty and frequency categories,"" Cornell said. ""At the same time, we encountered some unique challenges and cost pressures that impacted our bottom-line performance."" Total revenue of $25.7 billion in the third quarter was up 1.1% over the previous year, but fell short of the $25.9 billion expected by analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence. Increased digital sales cut into profit because of the higher cost of fulfilling orders, the company said. The company also had higher supply chain costs due to managing higher inventory levels, which occurred because the retailer ordered more goods to offset a potential port strike Oct. 1. Skittish and deal-hungry customers responded well to the Target Circle Week, held Oct. 6-12. But sales dipped the week before and after the sales event, the company said, suggesting how resourceful customers have become. And executives expressed excitement about customers being drawn to the stores for the upcoming Nov. 29 release of Taylor Swift's “The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology” on vinyl and CD, exclusively at Target, which includes four acoustic bonus songs (the vinyl album also includes a poster of Swift). During the period, the retailer added nearly three million members to its Target Circle loyalty program, which it revamped in April. Target also cut prices on more than 2,000 items this holiday season. While shopper visits rose 2.4% during the three-month period, that was lower than the 3% traffic growth in the prior quarter. ""Things have taken a turn (for Target) in Q3. And it seems that the softness is going to linger into the holiday season as well,"" CFRA analyst Arun Sundaram told Reuters. ""Clearly, it's Walmart that's executing better and Target is really missing the mark,"" Sundaram said.

There are authentic ingredients and creative concoctions in brick-and-mortar shops and online. The global pantry beckons. Plus, in many cases, the packaging is gorgeous! Many of these affordable luxuries can be tucked into a stocking, but they also make great presents for a co-worker, mail carrier, nephew or teacher.

Nvidia's data center sales are driven by companies spending on AI chips amid an expansion of data centers aimed at enabling them to handle the complex processing needs of generative AI programs. The next-generation Blackwell chip was the focus of some concern among investors amid reports a design flaw was causing the advanced chips to overheat, but Nvidia said it has fixed the design flaw and worked with manufacturer TSMC on the remedy.

(NASDAQ:LWAY) shares are trading lower on Wednesday after the company’s Board of Directors rejected a revised unsolicited acquisition proposal from Danone North America PBC. The proposal on November 15 offered $27.00 per share to acquire all of Lifeway’s shares that Danone does not already own. After careful evaluation, including consultations with independent financial and legal advisors, the Lifeway Board determined that the offer significantly undervalued the company and was not in the best interests of Lifeway’s shareholders or other stakeholders. According to a recent Schedule 13D amendment filing, Danone beneficially owns approximately 23.3% of Lifeway’s outstanding common stock. On November 5, 2024, Lifeway announced that its Board had rejected Danone’s initial unsolicited, non-binding proposal of $25.00 per share, citing that it substantially undervalued the company. Lifeway said it remains committed to its strategic plan of expanding its kefir offerings while also branching into adjacent product categories.

Lifeway said it generated a total shareholder return of 788% over the past five years, vastly outperforming its food and beverage industry peers and the S&P 500. In line with its growth momentum, Lifeway has also announced the launch of a new functional beverage: Probiotic Smoothie + Collagen made with kefir cultures. This product comes in four flavors—Matcha Latte, Berry Blast, Tropical Fruit, and Plain—and contains 5 grams of collagen per serving. It is also lactose-free, capitalizing on the growing consumer demand for lactose-free dairy alternatives. According to Benzinga Pro, LWAY stock has gained over 56% in the past year.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/asian-stocks-ease-nvidias-forecast-030254358.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 7:02 PM","By Ankur Banerjee SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Asian equities fell on Thursday after AI darling Nvidia disappointed investors with a subdued revenue forecast, while the dollar firmed and bitcoin hit a record high in anticipation of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's proposed policies. Prevailing geopolitical concerns following the escalating conflict in Ukraine earlier this week led safe-haven assets higher, including gold and government bonds. The spotlight though was on earnings from the world's most valuable firm Nvidia, which projected its slowest revenue growth in seven quarters, sending its shares lower. Nasdaq futures slipped 0.47%, while S&P 500 futures eased 0.3%. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.23%, with tech heavy Taiwan stocks down 0.5%. Japan's Nikkei fell 0.7%. George Boubouras, head of research at Melbourne-based K2 Asset Management, said the market reaction to Nvidia's earnings was partly a result of very high expectations for each quarterly result. ""While they delivered impressive revenue growth and momentum, the market clearly wants more."" Charu Chanana, chief investment strategist at Saxo, said Nvidia earnings were a clear indication that the momentum in AI was only extending, with supplies being the bigger headwind rather than demand. ""The structural AI tailwind could continue to be a key driver for equities into the next year."" Elsewhere in Asia, stocks in China opened a shade lower, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng fell 0.22% at the open as the market remains rangebound even as some global funds follow domestic money into market segments sheltered from tariffs. Investor focus will also be on Indian conglomerate Adani Group after U.S. prosecutors said on Wednesday that Gautam Adani, billionaire chair of the group, has been indicted in New York over his role in an alleged multibillion-dollar bribery and fraud scheme. Dollar bond prices for Adani companies fell sharply in early Asia trade on Thursday. SOARING DOLLAR The dollar has been on the rise since the U.S. election in early November on anticipation that proposed tariffs of the incoming Trump administration will likely be inflationary and keep rates higher for longer. The dollar index, which measures the U.S. currency against six rivals, was at 106.56, not far from the one-year high of 107.07 it touched last week. The index has risen more than 2% since the Nov. 5 election. [FRX/] The prospect of the Federal Reserve having to temper its rate cut cycle has also boosted the dollar. Markets were pricing in the Fed lowering borrowing costs by 25 basis points next month at 56%, down from 82.5% just a week ago, according to CME's FedWatch Tool. Two Federal Reserve governors on Wednesday laid out competing visions of where U.S. monetary policy may be heading, with one citing ongoing concerns about inflation and another expressing confidence that price pressures will continue to ease. The rise in the dollar has led the Japanese yen back into intervention territory, leading to verbal warnings from officials. On Thursday, the Asian currency strengthened a bit and was last at 155.04 per dollar. Bitcoin has been on a tear since the election as the Trump administration are expected to relax regulations and be crypto friendly. The world's largest cryptocurrency, bitcoin, soared to touch a record of $95,040 in early trading and was last at $94,787. In commodities, supply concerns triggered by escalating geopolitical tensions amid the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine led oil prices higher. Brent crude futures for January rose 0.5% to $73.17, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures for January gained 0.5%, at $69.11.

The company also declared a dividend of $3.65 per share, comprising a regular dividend of $2.81 per share plus a special dividend of 84 cents per share. Eli Glickman, Zim president and chief executive, in an earnings release credited the strong results to investment in new, larger vessels and a decision made earlier in the year to leverage earnings against spot volumes in the trans-Pacific trade. Ocean carriers profits have also benefited from diversions and longer voyages due to port labor disputes, congestion, and disruption of shipping through the Suez Canal and Red Sea. “We will close out the year with the final delivery of the remaining four out of 46 newbuild containerships that we secured, which include 28 LNG-powered vessels,” Glickman said.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Banking Dive newsletter. Washington, D.C., Attorney General Brian Schwalb sued EarnIn on Tuesday, claiming the fintech “deceptively market[s]” its “cash out” product as earned wage access when it’s really a loan – at times carrying a more than 300% interest rate. “EarnIn lures in hard-working, cash-strapped workers with the false promise of free instant cash advances, and then charges them unlawfully high interest,” Schwalb said in a statement. “This predatory business model is illegal. Especially at a time when the cost of living is already too high, my office will always have Washingtonians’ backs.” At issue is EarnIn’s “Lightning Speed” feature, which allows users to immediately access their earned wages – but at $3.99 or $5.99 per transaction, a fee the attorney general’s office said is poorly disclosed. “The existence of these fees is buried in the fine print, and EarnIn does not inform users about the amount of the fees until after they sign up, provide a substantial amount of personal and financial information, and attempt to get the promised instant cash,” the AG’s office wrote in its release Tuesday. Roughly 90% of EarnIn’s D.C. users have paid “Lightning Speed” fees. But in addition to those charges, users are asked to leave a “tip,” with default amounts set between $1 and $14 per transaction, the AG’s office said. That flies in the face of claims EarnIn makes in TV, radio and online ads, promising “no fees” and “no interest,” the AG’s office said. The district’s lawsuit aims to permanently bar EarnIn from operating in D.C. and is seeking restitution, civil penalties and costs. Karl Racine, who is of counsel to EarnIn but was Schwalb’s predecessor as D.C.’s AG, said the district’s lawsuit “demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of how our product works and why so many D.C. residents benefit from it.” “EWA empowers individuals to make financial decisions that work for their unique situations,"" Racine said in a statement to American Banker. ""Elected officials should empower workers to make choices that best meet the needs of their families."" However, Lauren Saunders, associate director of the National Consumer Law Center, credited Schwalb for “see[ing] through the veneer” of EarnIn’s terminology. “A payday advance that is repaid on payday is a payday loan, and fintech cash advance apps like EarnIn that call themselves ‘earned wage access’ are just high-cost lending in disguise,” Saunders said Tuesday in a statement, highlighting the 300% interest figure. D.C. caps its interest rate at 24%. Roughly 20,000 D.C. residents have used EarnIn for more than 1 million transactions since 2016, the AG’s office said. However, it’s operating in the district without the lending license it needs, the office argued. But Phil Goldfeder, CEO of the American Fintech Council, said that license shouldn’t apply. ""Simply put, EWA is not a loan, and should not be regulated as such,” he said in a statement Tuesday. “It bears no hallmarks of a traditional lending product – it is a no-cost, non-recourse tool providing millions of Americans with safe, convenient access to wages they have already earned.” EarnIn, though, is not affiliated with employers and does not have access to workers’ wages, the AG’s office argued. Goldfeder, however, called companies like EarnIn “responsible innovators” because of the user base they tend to serve. “It is these exact consumers – who are underbanked or have little to no credit history – that will be most harmed by efforts to reclassify EWA,” Goldfeder said. “AFC strongly objects to any legal, legislative, or regulatory action that seeks to erroneously classify EWA as a loan product and limit access to this safe, innovative financial product for the consumers who need it the most.” Recommended Reading CFTC sues Binance over compliance ‘evasion’","This story originally on Banking To receive daily news and subscribe to our free daily Dive Washington, D.C., Attorney General Brian Schwalb on Tuesday, claiming the fintech “deceptively market[s]” its “cash out” product wage access when it’s really a loan at times a more 300% “EarnIn lures hard-working, workers with the false promise of free cash advances, charges them high Schwalb said in a statement. “This predatory business model is illegal. at a time when the cost of living already too my office will always Washingtonians’ backs.” At issue EarnIn’s Speed” feature, which users to immediately access their earned wages – but at $3.99 or $5.99 per transaction, fee the attorney general’s office poorly disclosed. “The existence of these fees is buried in the fine print, EarnIn does not inform users about the the fees until after they sign provide a of personal and financial and attempt to get the promised instant cash,” the office wrote its Tuesday.

Dividend stocks or dividend funds can help you earn regular passive income from some of the strongest companies in the economy. Here are 10 high dividend stocks to consider for your portfolio and how to invest in them. When you’re looking for ways to receive regular dividend payments, you generally have two options: stocks that pay dividends and funds that hold stocks that pay dividends. Here’s how each one works. Investing in a dividend stock is no different from investing in any other stock. You’ll need a brokerage account, which can easily be set up through an online broker, in order to place a trade. Once your account is set up and funded, you can choose which dividend stocks to invest in. Your broker may even be able to help you identify dividend stocks with large payouts through its research offering. If you’re not quite sure which high-dividend stocks to choose, a dividend fund may be a better option for you. Mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) focused on dividends hold a basket of stocks that pay dividends. Some of these funds focus on stocks with high dividend yields, while others look for companies that have consistently paid and grown their dividends over time. By choosing a fund, you won’t have to worry about closely tracking the individual stocks in the portfolio because the fund’s diversification should shelter you from having too much exposure to a single stock.

The forecast was offset by signs of demand for the company’s newest product line, Blackwell. US stocks had struggled to find footing in the run up to the results with the latest Ukraine-Russia tensions also weighing on sentiment. The S&P 500 ended the day little changed, as did the Nasdaq 100, while the dollar strengthened. The technology-heavy gauge had fallen more than 1% intraday following Ukraine’s missile strikes on Russia. Treasuries fell across the curve after an auction of 20-year bonds received a lukewarm reception, adding to the cautious tone on Wall Street. Trading in options signaled Nvidia results were the most important catalyst left this year — more than the Federal Reserve’s December meeting, according to Barclays Plc strategists. Its stock price has nearly tripled in 2024. Nvidia’s swings often bleed through to smaller stocks, according to Bespoke Investment Group. “Since the end of May, there has been a tendency for the Russell 2000 to perform poorly when NVDA has surged as it sucks all the capital from the pool, and vice versa,” the strategists wrote. To Subitha Subramaniam, chief economist at Sarasin & Partners, the market’s reliance on single stocks to drive benchmarks higher sets off red flags. “The health of the market being driven by results of individual companies in itself points to a certain element of fragility,” she said. “Is it sufficient that they beat, is it sufficient that they beat by a big margin? We are hanging on every statement of the CEO.” Bloomberg’s gauge of the dollar advanced 0.4%, rebounding from a three-day drop. US Treasuries struggled to erase losses while Wall Street’s fear gauge, the VIX, advanced for the second day, jumping as much as 15%. Traders are also monitoring President-elect Donald Trump’s administration picks, especially his selection for the Treasury secretary role. Former Federal Reserve Governor Kevin Warsh and Apollo Global Management’s Marc Rowan are contenders, according to people familiar with the matter. Meanwhile, Trump tapped Cantor Fitzgerald LP Chief Executive Officer Howard Lutnick to lead the Commerce Department, a key role to facilitate his tariff and trade policies. “As I look at the Treasury secretary race, I want to see exactly who is in that role because the tax policies, the debt limit all come back,” Ed Mills, Washington policy analyst at Raymond James, told Bloomberg Television. “We need to see exactly how that person has a relationship with the Federal Reserve, because monetary policy will quickly figure into all of this.” Meanwhile, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said she wants to move cautiously on further interest-rate cuts as progress in reducing inflation has slowed. Swaps traders are betting on slightly better than a 50-50 chance of another rate cut at the US central bank’s Dec. 18 meeting.

The stock formed a shooting star on Tuesday, a reversal candlestick pattern that appears after an extended uptrend. The pattern formed on the highest daily volume since late September, possibly indicating buying exhaustion. Investors should watch major support levels on Walmart's chart around $81, $71, and $61. A bars pattern projects a price target in the stock of around $89 and indicates the shares may be about to enter a consolidation phase. Walmart (WMT) shares were slightly higher Wednesday morning after hitting a new record high yesterday following a strong earnings report from the retail giant. During the earnings call, CEO Douglas McMillon told analysts that the retailer continues to capture market share gains from higher-income households, adding that he expects the trend to last as these consumers have embraced the company’s membership program and same-day delivery service. Walmart shares inched higher to around $87 in recent trading, after hitting an all-time high of $88.29 on Tuesday. The stock has gained 65% since the start of the year, handily outpacing the S&P 500’s 23% return over the same period. Below, we break down the technicals on Walmart’s chart and identify important post-earnings price levels that investors may be watching. After bottoming out just below the 200-day moving average in December last year, Walmart shares have tracked higher, with two breakaway gaps separating three distinct trending moves. Although the stock rallied to a new all-time high (ATH) on Tuesday, it closed near its opening price to form a shooting star, a reversal candlestick pattern, which comprises a small body with a long upper shadow that appears after an extended uptrend. It’s also worth pointing out that the shooting star pattern formed on the highest daily volume since late September, possibly indicating buying exhaustion. Below we identify three major support levels on Walmart’s chart and also apply a bars pattern to analyze the stock’s current uptrend. The first key lower level to watch sits around $81. This area may provide support near a trendline that connects a range of similar trading levels on the chart between mid-September and late October. A close below this level opens the door for a decline to the $71 region, a location on the chart where investors could seek buying opportunities near the prominent July swing high. Depending on the timing of such a move, this area could also potentially align with the rising 200-day MA. Further selling could see the shares fill the mid-May gap and revisit major support around $61. Bargain hunters may look for buy-and-hold opportunities in this area near twin peaks that formed on the chart during March. Investors can use a bars pattern to gain insight about the stock’s third trending period, which appears to closely resemble the first trending phase. To forecast a target using the tool, we take the price bars from that first move and position them from the low of the third trending period. This projects a target of around $89, just above the stock’s ATH set on Tuesday. Further analysis of the first trending move shows that it played out over 69 trading days before the shares consolidated. Interestingly, the current move higher has trended over 67 trading days, indicating the stock may be about to enter a consolidation phase if price history rhymes.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pivoting-time-war-perfect-storm-172236442.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 9:22 AM","Operating a DeFi business requires managing extraordinary expectations and desires when the market is pumping, as well as putting robust systems and processes in place to protect people in case the market turns sour. Business is challenging enough on its own, with the human element being a primary part of that, but what happens when a war unexpectedly brings chaos to your doorstep? My company Peanut, a prop trading firm turned market maker from Kyiv, Ukraine, found out the answer the hard way. First, let’s rewind back to 2019. We launched Peanut as a prop trading firm, primarily earning revenue from internal trading strategies on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). In the following years, Peanut kept growing, with an even greater focus on the technical side of the business, aiming to deliver something impactful and meaningful. In anticipation of potential war, Peanut began preparing as early as 2021. We developed action plans for various scenarios, including the possibility of Kyiv being captured. We secured properties in Western Ukraine, such as in Lviv and the Carpathians, to ensure operational continuity and safety for our staff. This proactive approach meant that when the invasion occurred, 90% of our team relocated quickly, minimizing disruptions to our services. Then, in early 2022, Ukraine came under attack from Russia. At the same time, we noticed that the market was starting to change and become more competitive. Our competitors and even our main client (at that time) were pursuing mergers and acquisitions, as they felt this was the best way to stay ahead, but we bucked this trend. Instead of partnering up with other small and medium market makers to combine into something more powerful, we instead decided to brave it alone and invest more in Peanut. The company was small, technically focused, and relied on our strong personal networks. We had almost no sales division. Instead, we thrived on word of mouth and our connections from previous years. But during late 2022 and early 2023, we decided to build all the necessary departments to become a full-scale market maker. It was quite hard because, for a company from Eastern Europe, competencies in our company were mostly on the technical side. This pivot turned out to be one of the most crucial moments in Peanut’s existence, all with a war raging on outside. Becoming a full-scale market maker required us to staff a whole company, including, at last, a sales department. Still, we continued to dig into the technical expertise that had led us there. We had to build everything from the ground up, repositioning ourselves while navigating the constant challenges and daily struggles of war. There were daily power outages caused by Russian missile attacks, often we received messages from our employees that they couldn’t work from shelters; other times, they devoted time and effort to volunteering. I believe we were the only market maker in the world who continued launching projects under such conditions. Our clients had no idea about the circumstances we were working in. Despite disruptions, logistical challenges, and the chilling implications of an ongoing war, my team and I pushed through the adversities and resource limitations to compete with major market makers and win more market share. To achieve that, we needed to make not just a business pivot, but a strategic shift towards a particular type of client. I was acutely aware that smaller market makers were dissatisfied with larger and even medium-sized firms that often lacked transparency, efficiency, and profit-sharing mechanisms. I felt that by leveraging my existing network in the space, we could continue to grow, despite targeting smaller clients. We also took advantage of our relocation to Europe, attending more crypto conferences, which would have been logistically challenging if we were still based in Ukraine. This increased our visibility and allowed us to expand our B2C division, transitioning from being primarily a searcher and MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) specialist to becoming a full-fledged market maker. I’d say the key to our strategic shift was educating token issuers on the reality of market-making contracts, which many find misleading, whether intentionally or not. Many of the older token issuers still expect market makers to pump their tokens, leading to dissatisfaction with the services they receive from other market makers. This created opportunities for us to educate people on how things should be done and what the role of a market maker entails, including what is prohibited to do in the market and what constitutes normal market behavior. The pivot proved successful and allowed us to continue scaling. Once the war started, the Ukrainian IT industry, previously large and steadily growing, faced challenges as major companies questioned the reliability of working with Ukrainian firms, leading to reduced orders and layoffs. This made hiring easier than in 2021, so we continued recruiting in Ukraine, and now 100% of our technical staff are Ukrainian and we try to hire and give jobs to young people. Our workforce is distributed, so we have about 50% of our personnel in Ukraine and the rest in different countries across the world, including Portugal, Germany, Middle East and both North and South Americas.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chicago-credit-rating-risks-downgrade-011917962.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 9:10 AM","(Bloomberg) -- Chicago’s credit rating is at risk as Mayor Brandon Johnson and the city council spar over how to close a nearly $1 billion deficit in next year’s budget. Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting NY Congestion Pricing Survived a Pause. Here’s What Could Kill It S&P Global Ratings late Tuesday put the city on “CreditWatch with negative implications” as officials mull one-time measures to close the shortfall. While the firm affirmed its BBB+ rating, analysts see at least a one-in-two chance of a cut in the next three months. A downgrade hinges on the 2025 budget passage and whether the gap is closed with one-time fixes rather than structural changes, Scott Nees, an S&P credit analyst, said in a statement. “The negative watch indicates S&P’s concern that Chicago may undo years of budgetary discipline, which is valid,” Dennis Derby, a portfolio manager for Allspring Global Investments LLC, said on Wednesday. “There is time to work through budgetary issues constructively and should that fail to occur, the city’s credit profile would weaken.” The city is staring down a $982.4 million shortfall next year and Johnson faces mounting fiscal challenges such as rising pension and labor costs that make his progressive agenda increasingly difficult to implement. Plus, federal pandemic aid is running out, revenue is falling short of expectations and woefully underfunded pensions are testing the third-largest US city. Last week, the Chicago City Council rejected Johnson’s plan to raise property taxes by $300 million that would have helped close the gap, forcing the mayor to find alternative ways to balance the budget. During a press conference on Tuesday, Johnson said he was considering a $150 million property tax hike as well as boosting the tax on cloud computing and other levies to generate revenue. “We believe that this budget could represent a critical juncture for the city’s credit trajectory, as failure to implement structural solutions to contain the deficit will only defer action on hard choices that are likely necessary to place the city’s finances on a sustainable footing,” S&P analysts wrote in a report evaluating the credit. Sluggish Revenue The city already enacted a hiring freeze in September and curbed other expenses to save costs. A city spokesperson didn’t provide a comment on S&P’s move. “With COVID-era surplus funds now largely expended or being used to close the fiscal 2025 budget gap, Chicago’s ability to manage the budget deficit will have diminished going into the next budget cycle,” according to S&P. The company said that sluggish revenue performance and rising costs for personnel and pensions are projected to push the deficit to $1.1 billion in 2026 and $1.3 billion in 2027. The current rating, three steps above junk, is “untenable in the face of such a large structural deficit in the absence of a clear and politically actionable plan for addressing it,” S&P said. S&P also warned that the likelihood of Chicago ending the year without an adopted spending plan has increased after budget hearings have already been delayed by several weeks and because of the “politically fraught nature of budget negotiations thus far.” Allspring’s Derby is waiting to see how the discussions move forward. “We expect to see some budgetary discussions over the near term, and so long as there is an earnest dialogue, the city’s credit profile should remain robust,” Derby said. Fitch Ratings on Wednesday affirmed Chicago’s rating at A-, one step higher than S&P, with a stable outlook but still cautioned that “rating stability is predicated on Chicago’s ability and willingness to continue to adhere to sound fiscal practices.” “A reversion to its prior pattern of reliance on non-recurring solutions, aggressive revenue assumptions, and new recurring spending or revenue cuts without offsetting actions would trigger negative rating action,” according to Fitch.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/donald-trump-commerce-secretary-pick-180045030.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 12:03 PM","President-elect Donald Trump has named Howard Lutnick—the CEO known for his sharp-elbowed ascent to Wall Street’s upper echelon, as well as his resilience after the 9/11 attacks devastated his company—as his pick for secretary of commerce. In the new role, Lutnick, who has cochaired Trump’s transition team, will lead the incoming administration’s strategy on tariffs and trade and maintain direct responsibility over the Office of the United States Trade Representative, Trump announced in a post on Truth Social on Tuesday. Lutnick, a longtime New York power player, became president and CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, a Wall Street investment banking and financial services firm, in the early 1990s at just 29 years old. Throughout Trump’s 2024 campaign, Lutnick—who has donated over $1 million to Trump’s super PAC and hosted a $15 million fundraiser at his Hamptons house this summer—has served as a top economic advisor. Lutnick was one of the primary voices in Trump’s camp advocating for higher tariffs, in a bid to slash corporate taxes stateside and insulate U.S.-based business from competition overseas. For months, many suspected Trump would tap Lutnick for Treasury Secretary, a role that remains unfilled. A representative for Lutnick did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment. Lutnick, 63, climbed the business ladder quickly, but he didn’t have an easy start: Both his parents had died by the time he was 18, leaving him and his two siblings to fend for themselves. The New York native joined Cantor Fitzgerald as a bond trader shortly after graduating college and quickly formed a close mentor-mentee relationship with the firm’s founder, Bernard Cantor. Eight years after joining, Lutnick was named Cantor Fitzgerald’s president and CEO—having reportedly “elbowed his way to the top” as Cantor was on his deathbed—and five years after that, he became chairman. “There is no sugarcoating the fact that before, and even after, Sept. 11, Mr. Lutnick was widely disliked in the industry,” Susanne Craig wrote in the New York Times in 2011. “A ruthless competitor even by Wall Street standards, he has made more than a few enemies over the years. In 1996, as Mr. Cantor, his mentor, lay dying, Mr. Lutnick fought with Mr. Cantor’s wife, Iris, for control of Cantor Fitzgerald. She later barred him from the funeral.” Cantor Fitzgerald was brutalized by the 9/11 attacks. The firm was headquartered on the 101st through 105th floors of the World Trade Center’s North Tower; the hijacked flight hit floors 93 through 99, leaving those on the Cantor floors with no way of escaping. Every single worker who had been in the office—658 employees—died that morning, representing nearly 70% of the firm’s headcount. Lutnick was dropping his son off at kindergarten that morning and wasn’t in the office, but his younger brother, Gary, also a Cantor employee, was killed. Cantor employees represented nearly one in four of the victims killed in New York that day. Within a week, Lutnick returned to the trading desk and, amid widespread criticism, announced the firm would be cutting off paychecks to its deceased employees. He later pledged 25% of the firm’s profits over the next decade to their next of kin, along with ongoing health insurance coverage. He also gave them $90 million from his own personal savings. Today, Lutnick stands as one of Wall Street's longest-serving CEOs, with 41 years at the helm of Cantor Fitzgerald. During his tenure, Lutnick has overseen the $1.3 billion merger of BGC Partners, a financial services company, with eSpeed, an electronic bond trading platform, as well as taken Rumble, a video platform, public via special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). Earlier this year, through BCG Group—of which Lutnick is also CEO—he unveiled a futures exchange called FMX, which counts Morgan Stanley, Citi and Goldman Sachs among its equity partners. Meanwhile, his economic stake in the company is about 60%, up from 25% two decades ago. Over the past few months, Lutnick has balanced his CEO duties with his Trump campaign leadership by working for Cantor between 6:30 a.m. and 9 a.m., and then from 4 p.m. to 10:30 p.m., with Trump time in between, the Wall Street Journal reported. One of Trump’s primary talking points throughout his campaign has been his commitment to raising tariffs. As commerce secretary, Lutnick will be closer to that promise than any other appointee. “Tariffs are an amazing tool [for] the president to use,” Lutnick told CNBC in October, arguing that the Trump administration will use tariffs to “build.” “If we want to make it in America, tariff it, or if we’re competing with it, tariff it,” he added. Lutnick has become increasingly close to Elon Musk, another key Trump adviser, The New York Times pointed out, “and, given the Commerce Department’s role in expanding broadband internet access, [Lutnick] could provide the tech mogul’s Starlink with a significant boost.” As part of the transition team, Lutnick has been instrumental in recruiting and hiring. He has promised to do the same as a member of the administration, NPR reported—exclusively “stacking” the team with “loyalists.” Many, however, have voiced concern over Lutnick’s potential conflicts of interest, including regarding cryptocurrency; Cantor Fitzgerald, manages a handful of reserve funds for Tether, a stablecoin.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/possibly-earn-huge-158-payout-171530117.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 9:15 AM","It’s been said that elections have consequences. However, in the case of the second term of President-elect Donald J. Trump, his surprise victory could offer a huge — or is that yuge? — payout for EOG Resources (EOG) investors. As a hydrocarbon upstream specialist, EOG stock should fundamentally benefit from Trump’s public support for U.S. oil production. Therefore, I am bullish on the oil and gas producer. Discover the latest stocks recommended by top Wall Street analysts, all in one place with Analyst Top Stocks Make smarter investments with weekly expert stock picks from the Smart Investor Newsletter Another reason to consider EOG stock is its financial performance. For the third quarter, the underlying company posted solid results, delivering earnings per share of $2.89, beating the estimate calling for $2.78. On the sales front, a total of $5.89 billion was slightly off from expectations of $6 billion. However, management emphasized its “outstanding execution” across its multi-basin portfolio, noting in particular strong volumes and price realizations. With the political tailwind of an oil-friendly presidential administration, those likely aren’t just empty corporate statements. Trump could potentially extend a lifeline to legacy automakers, which in turn may spur more incentives for domestic fossil-fuel production. With this backdrop, EOG stock appears compelling. For those who believe the same, specialized options strategies can help deliver dramatic returns. Typically, bullish retail investors adopt the tried-and-true method of simply buying their target security in the open market. The idea here is quite intuitive: buy low and eventually sell high. However, it can take a long time — especially for an established entity like EOG stock — to move significantly higher. It’s here that many speculators turn to call options, which provide the leverage of 100 shares. However, one of the main challenges of call options is that “realistic” calls — that is, calls that are likely to be profitable prior to expiration — can be quite expensive due to the premiums charged. In technical terms, the investor must pay a debit to buy the desired call. For options to break even, the underlying security must rise to the listed strike price plus the premium paid. An alternative approach is to consider the Bull Call spread. This trade is very similar to buying a call option. However, the difference is that you also simultaneously sell a call at a higher strike. Certainly, the sale of the call caps your maximum profitability potential. At the same time, the credit (income) received from the short call can help offset some of the debit paid for your long call. For a heavily traded optionable security like EOG stock, prospective traders have multiple strike-price combinations to consider. Naturally, a question arises about which call spread to buy. To figure this out, one should establish a baseline trade. In other words, find a relatively conservative trade that is likely to be profitable (assuming the underlying thesis is correct) but still offers enough reward to be interesting. Now, to find this baseline, you should calculate the market’s expected movement for the security. You can do this by conducting a stochastic analysis. The quick-and-dirty approach is as follows: multiply the share price, the implied volatility (IV) of the target options chain, and the time decay adjustment. The end result gives you the expected movement of the stock to the upside or downside. Let’s look at the options chain expiring Dec. 20 as an example. Here, the average IV comes in at 24.86%. The time decay adjustment lands at 30.52. With a share price following Friday’s close of $134.56, the product of the three metrics is almost $10.21. That means EOG stock may rise to $144.77 or slip to $124.35. Since we’re bullish, we’re obviously focusing on the upper price target. Essentially, the market assumes that under ideal conditions, EOG stock may rise to $144.77. However, in actuality, the figure could be higher or lower. Since we’re looking to first establish a baseline trade, we should be conservative and downgrade this max price target when considering the short call strike price. In my opinion, a solid baseline trade to consider is the 130/140 call spread for the options chain expiring Dec. 20. Here, EOG stock only needs to rise above $135.14 to break even. What’s more, the short call strike of $140 is reasonable (2.5% higher than Monday’s close). Traders will put $514 at risk for the chance to gain $486, implying a maximum payout of 94.6%. However, if you really want to swing for the fences, you may consider the 135/140 call spread. The short call strike remains the same at $140. Thus, the difference is that the long strike rises to $135, boosting the breakeven threshold to $136.94. Still, since the long call is closer to the money, you would end up paying a smaller debit. Ultimately, there’s $194 at risk for the chance to gain $306, or a payout of 157.7%.

With Donald Trump’s second term poised to emphasize domestic fossil fuel production, EOG stands well-positioned to capitalize on heightened energy demand and potentially favorable policy shifts.

Target's sales and profits fell short of estimates, while Walmart's results surpassed expectations in the third quarter. Both retailers said lower prices and convenience features like curbside pickup and same-day delivery are driving sales, but those trends have seemed to benefit Walmart more in recent quarters. Target (TGT) shares sank to their lowest point since last November following the retailer's earnings Wednesday, a day after Walmart (WMT) shares set a new record high after the company released its third-quarter report. Target's Q3 results fell short of what analysts had expected, while Walmart's exceeded estimates as executives said the retailer continued to gain market share among higher-income customers. The move marks the second time this year that Target and Walmart shares have moved in opposite directions following earnings reports, as they did the same following first-quarter results in May. Trends the retailers identified at the time—like value-seeking behavior from customers across income levels, which favored Walmart—have continued into the third quarter.

""They're becoming increasingly resourceful in their shopping behaviors, waiting to buy until last moment of need, focusing on deals and then stocking up when they find them."" Cornell also said that Target is seeing a stronger response to sales events than they typically do. Chief Commercial Officer Rick Gomez noted that consumers seem prepared to wait for sales and search across multiple retailers to find the best price for something they want.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stocks-vs-bonds-better-choice-200000150.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 12:00 PM","For most investors, the majority of their portfolio will be made up of stocks and bonds. These two assets may be held in the form of mutual funds or ETFs that invest in underlying stocks and bonds, or you may hold positions in individual stocks or bonds directly. But how do you know whether to own more stocks or more bonds, and should some investors avoid stocks or bonds altogether? Here’s how to know whether stocks or bonds are the better choice for you. Before deciding whether stocks or bonds are a better fit for their portfolio, investors should understand the differences between the two asset classes. Stocks represent ownership stakes in real businesses and generate returns for shareholders through dividends and capital appreciation driven by the underlying companies’ earnings growth. While stocks have the potential to earn high returns, they can be quite volatile in the short term. Bonds are loans made to governments or corporations and typically generate income for bondholders through interest payments. Bonds tend to be less volatile than stocks, but you can still lose money investing in bonds, particularly in a rising interest rate environment. One of the first things you need to understand before making any investment is your own risk tolerance. Risk tolerance is your ability and willingness to take risk, and it has a big impact on the types of investments you should choose. All else being equal, someone with a high risk tolerance may be more inclined to own stocks because they’re willing to stomach the volatility in exchange for the high return potential. Before investing in stocks, you should ask yourself how you’d feel if your portfolio declined by 20 or 30 percent. While not a frequent occurrence, drawdowns of 20-30 percent (or more) do happen and investors should be prepared for them. Keep in mind that risk tolerance accounts for both your ability and willingness to take risk. Someone may have a high willingness to take risk, but if they have a large amount of debt and no emergency fund, their ability to take risk may be quite low. Conversely, someone may have a high ability to take risk, but market volatility makes them nervous and may lead to poor decisions. This person would have a low willingness to take risk and should focus on safer investments like bonds or other fixed-income securities. You’ll also want to consider your investing goals and the time frame for those goals when looking at stocks and bonds. These goals will impact your ability to take risk and influence the types of investments you should consider holding. Stocks tend to be a better fit for long-term goals such as retirement because of how volatile they can be in the short term. Goals that are at least five years down the road are typically a good fit for stock market investments. On the other hand, bonds and other short-term fixed income securities tend to be a better option for short-term goals because they are typically less volatile than stocks and can help generate returns above what you’d earn in a traditional savings account. Maybe you’re saving for a down payment on a house or a nice vacation a few years from now. Stocks are probably too risky for these short-term goals, but bonds may boost your returns while still providing the safety you’re looking for. When it comes down to it, most people will end up owning a combination of stocks and bonds in their portfolios. When you are far from your goals, stocks will make up a greater portion of your portfolio because their higher return potential and the longer time horizon gives you time to recover from any short-term losses. As you get closer to your goal, your portfolio’s asset allocation should shift away from stocks toward bonds and other fixed-income securities. For example, once someone reaches retirement, they may want to hold more bonds because of bonds’ ability to generate income once they’re no longer working. It may be useful to work with a financial advisor to determine the best asset allocation strategy for your portfolio. Bankrate’s financial advisor matching tool can help you find an advisor in your area.

I think after that, we will go into January and February, and the weather will slow it down. I think that March will start seeing a nice turn in freight.” Parker was the keynote speaker on Day 2 of FreightWaves’ F3: Future of Freight Festival in Chattanooga, Tennessee. He was joined on stage Wednesday by FreightWaves CEO Craig Fuller in a discussion that dived into leadership and innovation in logistics. Chattanooga-based Covenant Logistics Group (NYSE: CVLG) was founded in 1986 by David and Jacqueline Parker. The company started as Covenant Transport with 25 trucks and 50 trailers. Today, Covenant Logistics owns a fleet of over 2,500 trucks and offers a portfolio of transportation and logistics services throughout the country, including asset-based expedited and dedicated truckload capacity, as well as asset-light warehousing, transportation management and freight brokerage services. Parker said listening to customers is a big part of Covenant Logistics’ success over the years. “At the end of the day, freight is going to go the way freight has got to go,” Brown said. “It’s going to find its home. We’ve always got to be open. Our eyes have to be open. Our ears are going to be open. We’ve got to be listening to our customers that are telling us where freight is going.” With the presidential election over, Parker said he feels the mood in the transportation industry and Wall Street has been more optimistic. Parker has recently been in New York to attend an industry conference, as well as to celebrate the company’s transfer of its stock listing to the New York Stock Exchange from the Nasdaq Global Select Market. “No. 1, the flavor yesterday at Wall Street, shareholders and the carriers that were there … they are thrilled with the election, because I think besides putting away doubt, they do see the policies. This administration’s trucking policies are a lot better than the Biden administration. I know that the trucking industry is going to be in much better shape from regulations.” Parker said the Trump administration could likely peel back Environmental Protection Agency regulations on emissions, as well as ease up on policies pushing for electrification in the transportation industry. “Let’s get clean air: I believe in all that stuff but also believe that it needs to be realistic, and that is, we’re not going to be there in 2030,” Parker said. “[The Biden administration] came out with saying we’re going to have to have all electric engines in 2030. No, you’re not. Quit playing the game, because it ain’t going to happen. That can happen in 2040 maybe, but it’s not happening in 2030.” While Trump’s proposed tariffs could slow freight movement, the Trump administration’s focus on domestic oil production could be a boost for the trucking industry, according to Parker. “The thing that I’m wondering is that if the tariffs happen, or how much the tariffs are, no nation in the world is going to give up on America,” he said. “We have 340 million people that buy stuff, more than anywhere in the world. They buy stuff. They’re not going to give up if [Trump] puts X amount percent of tariffs; they’re going to figure a way to continue to send it over to America. It was evident by the last four years that Trump had in office, when he put tariffs in. Inflation was nothing.

But missing from their baseline calls is one of the most popular themes of the past 18 months in markets: artificial intelligence. AI driving the market higher has been a hallmark of market calls dating back to the spring of 2023 when Nvidia's first blowout earnings report of the cycle kickstarted a roaring bull market rally. On Monday, BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski initiated a 2025 year-end target of 6,700 for the S&P 500. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson issued a 12-month target of 6,500. Neither leaned too far into the impact of AI driving stocks higher — perhaps a sign of a maturing bull market — and instead, both discussed further broadening of the rally away from the tech-concentrated stock market of the past two years. ""We expect this broadening in earnings growth to continue as the Fed cuts rates into next year and business cycle indicators continue to improve,"" Wilson wrote. Belski's work shows the market has already broadened, with 276 stocks outperforming the S&P 500 in the second half of 2024 — better than the 10-year average of 238 and above the number seen since the start of 2023. At the surface this can lead to weaker gains for the index, as smaller gains in small companies make for smaller overall gains. Dating back to 1990, Belski found that when the top 100 stocks in the S&P 500 outperform, the index delivers an average annual return of 11.8% compared to the average return of 8% when those stocks underperform the index. In other words, the returns aren't bad; they're just not as great as the ones investors have enjoyed for two years now. To be clear, the idea that an AI-related fever could keep driving stock prices higher hasn't been forgotten among Wall Street strategists. Just two weeks ago, Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel wrote that he sees the S&P 500 reaching 6,600 by June 2025 as ""exuberance lies ahead"" amid a ""public reengaged in speculation."" Wilson did offer a bull case in which wide AI adoption juices margins — and pushes the flagship index near 7,400. For any investor in the S&P 500, that of course sounds like an appealing scenario. But perhaps even more appealing is that strategists no longer need to rely on AI to explain why the market will keep moving higher. Even if AI doesn't show up to the party, Wall Street expects a good time. It's a stark contrast from where things stood in 2023, when AI mentions first started littering S&P 500 target changes across Wall Street and the macro backdrop was much more bleak. Recession fears were still common among economists. The other 493 S&P 500 stocks were still in an earnings recession. And speculation around the Fed centered on how much more they'd hike interest rates, not cut them. While those debates could resurface at any moment, we've made it to the other side of all those rungs on the wall of worry. And for now, Wilson's base case is driven by a backdrop where the broadening of earnings rolls on as the Fed cuts rates and business cycle indicators continue to improve.

During Delta Air Lines' (DAL) 2024 investor day, the company laid out its vision for a ""customized experience"" for travelers. Delta said it expects premium ticket revenue to exceed main cabin ticket revenue by 2027. “Just to be clear, we’re not going to have more premium seats than main seats,” CEO Ed Bastian said at a media roundtable, noting that premium revenue will be more diversified. “Premium could be the American Express card transaction. It could be our [seat] load. It could be other ways in which we transact or engage with customers in our ecosystem as compared to just main cabin, which used to be the dominant form in our industry.” Delta believes the premium push will impress customers and lead to margin improvement — a key metric shareholders track to gauge earnings growth. The airline anticipates 85% of revenue growth in 2025 will come from the additional premium seats, which may help the business meet or exceed its pre-pandemic average operating margin of 14%. Delta's revenue growth from premium offerings has continued to outpace revenue growth in the main cabin. In the third quarter, revenue from premium ticketing grew 4% year over year to $5.3 billion, compared to a 5% decline in main cabin passenger revenue, which came in at $6.3 billion. The airline is prioritizing premium experiences as 5% more travelers have taken to the skies in 2024 than in 2023, based on TSA throughput data. “The industry is actually catching up with the ability to sell its products in a very different way,” Delta president Glen Hauenstein said. “And so we’re going to try our darndest not to alienate customers as we move along this, but just provide them more choice.” Delta isn’t the only air carrier piloting perks-forward experiences. JetBlue (JBLU) management recently detailed additional steps it took to generate demand with premium consumers.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-to-choose-the-best-savings-options-to-cover-the-cost-of-college-175447333.html,"Tue, Nov 19, 2024, 9:54 AM","Listen and subscribe to Decoding Retirement on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts. The cost of college tuition at some universities is fast approaching $100,000 per year, and the rise in higher education expenses shows no signs of slowing down, according to Ross Riskin, the chief learning officer of the Investments & Wealth Institute. And yet, even though saving and paying for college continues to be a top priority for most families, many still make suboptimal decisions that put other goals at risk, such as saving enough for their own retirement, Riskin said in a recent episode of Decoding Retirement (see video above or listen below). Riskin discussed the benefits of families saving early for future education expenses and making sure all family members understand their roles. For instance, if grandparents or aunts and uncles plan on helping out, it is best to capture that information early on to create an optimal and efficient funding plan, he noted. “We need to know who's actually going to be involved in the funding process,” he said. “Understanding that early on helps us build a more accurate plan of how much we actually need to save.” Talking to family members about contributing to education costs might seem challenging, at least on paper. However, according to Riskin, the actual difficulty of the conversation “depends on everybody’s education funding philosophy and, really, college funding philosophy.” Time horizon plays a key role in helping parents choose the most suitable education savings options, such as 529 plans and Coverdell education savings accounts, among others. A 529 is a tax-advantaged savings account specifically designed to help individuals save for education expenses, whereas a Coverdell account is a trust or custodial account designed for paying a beneficiary's qualified education expenses. According to Riskin, households should consider four main factors when evaluating these vehicles and their underlying investment options. The first two criteria are operational flexibility and investment flexibility. Operational flexibility refers to how the account is opened and managed, how funds are added or withdrawn, the ability to change account owners or beneficiaries, and overall ease of operation. Investment flexibility, meanwhile, considers how much money can be contributed, what types of investments are available, any limitations on changing investment allocations, and how frequently adjustments can be made. For instance, 529 plans may have limited investment options and restrict changes to twice per year. The next factor to consider is tax efficiency, which involves understanding any tax benefits or other implications when contributing or withdrawing funds from an account. Some accounts, like 529s and Coverdells, offer tax advantages that other options may not. Read more: How do education tax credits work and who qualifies? Lastly, families should consider financial aid efficiency, or how the account affects financial aid eligibility. Some accounts can be treated as an asset for aid calculations and certain withdrawals may count as income, which can negatively impact aid. Who owns the account — whether it be a parent, student, or other family member — also influences this factor. Riskin generally favors 529 plans due to their advantages across the four key criteria. However, individuals who want a wider range of investment choices might find Coverdell ESAs or taxable brokerage accounts to be more suitable options. In other cases, it might be appropriate to consider saving for college costs using a custodial account, often referred to as Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA) and Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) accounts. Such accounts make it easy to give financial gifts to a child without the cost of setting up a trust. However, the account must be transferred to the child once they reach a certain age and could reduce college financial aid eligibility. Given that there’s no one ideal education savings vehicle, Riskin suggested exploring all options. “It really is this puzzle that you’re trying to put together,” he said, noting that he’s a big fan of using multiple savings accounts. “I’m not an all-or-nothing [person]. I’m not putting everything into [a] 529 or putting everything into a brokerage account. … You want to have flexibility.” Riskin also highlighted the importance of filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), even for families who don’t expect to qualify for aid. He noted that the FAFSA is required to access federal student loans — which may be eligible for forgiveness — along with work-study programs. And some schools, he said, even require it to consider students for merit-based scholarships, regardless of financial need. Additionally, with rising college costs, families who previously assumed they earned too much may now qualify for need-based aid at higher-cost schools. Looking ahead, Riskin also suggested that some education-related policies may remain stable while others face uncertainty under the incoming Trump administration. Riskin expects the policy allowing 529 funds for K-12 tuition (up to $10,000 per year currently) to remain in place and potentially expand — a move that would reflect the Trump administration’s support for private education options. However, one of the income-driven repayment plans, the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, as well as the tax-free income status of loan forgiveness plans might be at risk. In July, a federal court issued an injunction blocking the implementation of certain aspects of the SAVE Plan and other IDR plans. At present, public service loan forgiveness is tax-free, but forgiveness under IDR plans may be taxable after 2025 unless Congress extends the current tax exemption, which Riskin believes is unlikely. Read more: Will I be taxed on student loan forgiveness? There are other implications for colleges as well. Changes to immigration policies could reduce the number of international students in the US, which could financially strain colleges that rely on their tuition. This may lead to increased tuition costs or budget cuts in other areas. Ultimately, Riskin advised against making sudden moves, like paying off student loans immediately, and recommended waiting to see how policies evolve, as federal loans offer flexibility and potential forgiveness options that private loans may not.

On Tuesday, the world's biggest retailer posted fiscal third quarter results that easily beat Wall Street expectations. Sales of $169.59 billion topped analyst estimates for $167.5 billion. Adjusted earnings per share eclipsed estimates by $0.05 at $0.58. ""We had a really strong quarter,"" Walmart CFO John David Rainey told Yahoo Finance, noting that e-commerce now makes up 18% of the business overall as consumers lean into convenience via delivery and pickup. Walmart stock rose over 4% in early trading on Tuesday. The stock is up 65% year to date, outperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Average's (^DJI) 14% advance. Here's what Walmart posted for its third quarter of fiscal year 2025 results, compared to Bloomberg consensus estimates: Revenue: $169.59 billion versus $167.5 billion Adjusted earnings per share: $0.58 versus $0.53 Overall same-store sales growth: 5.5% versus 3.81% Walmart US same-store sales growth: 5.3% versus 3.68% Foot traffic growth: 3.1% versus 2.82% Ticket growth: 2.1% versus 1.2% E-commerce sales growth: 22% versus 2.22% Sam's Club US same-store sales growth: 7% versus 4.22% Walmart US same-store sales jumped 5.3%, driven by an increase in foot traffic, up 3.1%, and a higher average ticket, up 2.1%. That's compared to the 4.9% same-store sales increase it posted this time last year. In the US, e-commerce sales rose 22%, while Walmart's advertising unit, Walmart Connect, grew 26%. Membership income also saw a double-digit percentage increase. The retailer notched gains across all product categories and income cohorts. Rainey said roughly 75% of its share gains came from households that are making more than $100,000 a year. Sales in the groceries category grew by mid-single digits as ""food units reached the highest level in four years"" led by pantry products. Personal care and household cleaning products also saw sales growth. Its private-brand penetration rose 80 basis points as it doubled down with new lines like Bettergoods early this year. Groceries make up about 60% of US sales for Walmart. Read more: Best credit cards for Thanksgiving groceries (November 2024) Walmart signaled it sees the momentum continuing for the holiday shopping season, raising its guidance for fiscal year 2025 for the third time. Net sales are now expected to grow between 4.8% and 5.1%. Previously, Walmart guided to 3.75% to 4.75% sales growth. Coming into the year, Walmart had expected 3% to 4% sales growth. Adjusted operating income is expected to grow between 8.5% to 9.25%, compared to previous guidance of 6.5% to 8%. Adjusted earnings per share for the full fiscal year is pegged to come in between $2.42 and $2.47, above the high end of the previously expected range of $2.35 to $2.43. The holiday is ""off to a good start in line with our expectations,"" Rainey said. In Q4, same-store sales are expected to grow between 3% and 4%. Walmart has maintained an edge in value, offering prices that are about 10% to 12% cheaper for an average basket of food, Goldman Sachs analyst Kate McShane told Yahoo Finance prior to the results. Its strategy is even ""giving Amazon a lot of competition,"" LSEG Director of Consumer Research Jharonne Martis told Yahoo Finance ahead of the results. ""They're giving the consumer the ability to shop the way they want to, whether it be ordering it on your mobile ... and picking it up at the store on your way home or just having it delivered right there from the store to your house,"" Martis said. To that end, Walmart's US health and wellness business grew sales by mid-teens, led by an increase in pharmacy scripts. Sales of GLP-1 drugs contributed about 1% to the segment's sales. The general merchandise category still saw sales softness. ""Consumers are spending ""less [on] general merchandise as they're spending more on food,"" Rainey said. Alternative revenue streams like Walmart+ membership fees and Walmart Connect advertising also continue to perform well. Membership and other income grew 16.1% year over year to $1.59 billion. Its e-commerce marketplace is ""getting very close to being profitable,"" said McShane. In the quarter, global e-commerce sales grew 27% overall, boosted by store pickup and marketplace sales. ""There's more buy-in from the investor base [in] the alternative revenue streams that Walmart's been going after ... that they are faster-growing and higher-margin businesses that should drive better profitability for the company longer term,"" McShane said. And investors are keeping an eye on Walmart International. Kathryn McLay, who previously served as the CEO of Sam's Club, took over last September following Judith McKenna's retirement. The company is focusing on key markets like China, India, and Mexico and doubling down on low prices. International revenue grew 8.0% to $30.3 billion in Q3, led by growth from Indian e-commerce firm Flipkart, which Walmart owns a majority stake in. Businesses in Mexico, known as Walmex, and China, reported strength from Sam's Club and e-commerce. — Brooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-competition-to-become-trumps-treasury-secretary-is-getting-more-harried-by-the-day-144852367.html,"Mon, Nov 18, 2024, 6:48 AM","The contest for treasury secretary is emerging as a key stumbling block in Donald Trump's presidential transition as candidates rise and fall by the day and top advisers make their arguments before millions of followers. Last week, the top contenders appeared to be Howard Lutnick, CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, and Scott Bessent, a former Soros Fund Management investing chief. But the water is now murkier than ever after a weekend of even more intense back-and-forth unlike anything surrounding Trump's other picks so far. ""Would be interesting to hear more people weigh in on this,"" Elon Musk even asked his 200+ million followers on social media platform X on Saturday before making his own views clear. ""My view fwiw is that Bessent is a business-as-usual choice, whereas [Lutnick] will actually enact change."" But even Musk hasn't been able to put an end to the debate, with Bessent still being pushed by prominent backers in Trump's orbit but new contenders apparently now in consideration. On Sunday, the New York Times reported that Lutnick has ""gotten on Mr. Trump’s nerves lately."" The president-elect is now expected to meet this week with former Federal Reserve governor Kevin Warsh and Apollo Global Management CEO Marc Rowan in a sign he is unsatisfied with his choices. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management). While much of the jockeying appears to be about not spooking the stock market with a controversial pick, much of the debate playing out in public appears to be about finding a candidate who is credible to business leaders but also on board with Trump's economic ideas, specifically tariffs. Trump has long championed import duties as a potential ""ring around the country"" but the business community has often been much less sanguine about his ideas. Read more: How do tariffs work, and who really pays them? The attempt to bridge the divide has been on display for weeks. ""When was America great?"" Lutnick asked the crowd at Madison Square Garden before the election and before discussing the 1890s as an era where ""all we had was tariffs"" and the economy was ""rocking."" It got a cheer but was clearly designed to appeal mostly to Trump himself, who talked about the era of William McKinley pretty much nonstop on the campaign trail. Bessent weighed in last week with a Fox News op-ed in which he argued that tariffs have a ""long and storied history as both a revenue-raising tool and a way of protecting strategically important industries."" As for Rowan, when he was asked about a possible trade war during an appearance at Yahoo Finance's Invest conference last week, he downplayed the chances, saying, ""Markets ... at the moment are not pricing in much for geopolitical risk."" He then quickly pivoted to arguing that Trump isn't a risk for global instability because of his strength. The clear tension is that many of these candidates have often espoused more free trade efforts in the past and even, in the case of Warsh, have discussed ""the false promise of protectionism."" How that would work in a Trump administration that appears determined to go ahead with high duties remains to be seen, but the prospect of the tariffs has already led to considerable unease in the business community about their effect on everyday items and manufacturing inputs. President-elect Trump is expected to meet with his additional candidates this week, according to multiple reports, signaling a process that could continue in the days ahead. The Wall Street Journal also reported that Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee could also be in the mix The president-elect's quickly changing preferences have already hung over the entire transition process after other picks have surprised political observers multiple times with conventional choices for other posts being discarded in favor of nominees that few saw coming. Other candidates have publicly announced they aren't in the running for the job. Last Tuesday, billionaire investor John Paulson took his hat out of the ring for contention, saying ""complex financial obligations"" would keep him in the private sector. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon also made it clear Thursday that he won't be working for Trump in the coming years. Fox Business host Larry Kudlow was also briefly mentioned as a candidate before representatives of the anchor told multiple reporters he is looking instead to stay with the network. The treasury secretary pick is also closely scrutinized, as it could be holding up other prominent economic choices, such as the next commerce secretary, National Economic Council director, and trade representative. Trump has nonetheless gone ahead with other economic-facing posts, announcing Brendan Carr as chairman of the Federal Communications Commission and Chris Wright as secretary of energy.

The precious metal extended its gains from Monday as investors flocked to the asset traditionally seen as a safe haven during times of geopolitical uncertainty. On Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a revised nuclear doctrine, formally lowering the threshold for Russia's use of its nuclear weapons. The move followed a decision by the Biden administration to allow Ukraine's use of long-range US-made missiles to strike deep into Russia.

In a client note this week, Stifel analyst Ruben Roy raised his price target on Nvidia to $180 from $165, while Truist Securities' William Stein raised his price outlook to $167 from $148. Roy cited ""a diverse set of data points,"" including continued high spending on AI infrastructure by hyperscalers and demand for Nvidia's latest Blackwell AI chips. ""We believe that NVDA is well positioned in markets that combine to yield an overall TAM [total addressable market, or revenue opportunity] of more than $100 billion exiting 2025 and a longer-term opportunity funnel that could approach $1 trillion,” Roy wrote. Nvidia stock also rose on news that one of its customers, cloud provider Nebius Group (NBIS), is launching its first GPU cluster in the US, which will use up to 35,000 Nvidia chips. A GPU cluster is a network of graphics processing units, or AI chips, with massive compute power used to train and run artificial intelligence software. For reference, Nebius' order of 35,000 Nvidia chips is equivalent to about 4% of the volume of Hopper AI chips Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia to have shipped in the October period, Bloomberg consensus data shows. Nvidia declined to comment on the deal. Nvidia stock’s climb comes a day after shares fell on a report by the Information about overheating issues with its Blackwell AI servers. In August, Nvidia was reportedly dealing with design flaws related to the individual Blackwell chips themselves, which prompted the company to push back the chips' production ramp to the January quarter. Nvidia has not confirmed overheating issues with its Blackwell servers, and the company told Yahoo Finance Monday that ""the engineering iterations are normal and expected."" Truist Securities’ Stein said of the overheating issues reported this week, “Conversations with our industry contacts don't precisely corroborate this latest data point, but they do reflect supply chain challenges around the production ramp.” Despite reported Blackwell issues, Dell Technologies (DELL) said it has already shipped its latest AI hardware product, the PowerEdge system, with Nvidia’s latest GB200 NVL72 systems. “[C]ommentary from NVDA, partners, and our industry contacts feel overwhelmingly positive,” Stein wrote in a note to investors. He pointed to emerging demand for Nvidia chips in the robotics and “traditional” computing sectors as well as that from AI software developers. KeyBanc analysts took a more cautious outlook on Nvidia ahead of earnings, lowering their earnings and revenue outlook for Nvidia for the January quarter, citing a squeeze on demand in China for Nvidia H20 chips. ""We believe H20 demand in China is getting pushed out as there is increased pressure among China hyperscalers to use domestic AI solutions,"" they wrote in a note on Tuesday. They also stated fears that Nvidia’s latest Blackwell chips could cannibalize Nvidia's prior-generation Hopper chips. ""Regarding H200, we are hearing that some demand is getting pushed out given the availability of Blackwell (B200)."" KeyBanc lowered its fiscal fourth quarter sales guidance for Nvidia to $37.7 billion from $40 billion and its earnings outlook to $0.83 per share from its prior guidance of $0.88 per share.

On Wednesday, the retail giant badly missed third quarter Wall Street profit forecasts, slashed full-year guidance after raising it the previous quarter, and took a cautious stance on holiday sales and profit. Target stock sank 21% in early market trading on the heels of the release of its quarterly results. By contrast, its rival Walmart (WMT) beat expectations again — significantly — in quarterly same-store sales performance, online sales growth, and overall narrative to investors, in its own report on Tuesday. Target has been slashing prices on food and other everyday essentials this year in a bid to compete. On a call with reporters, Target execs offered up little explanation for the U-turn in results, except to note that consumers are spending ""cautiously"" in more-discretionary departments such as home goods. The company also felt the brunt of unplanned costs in its supply chain as it added more inventory than it sold in the quarter — never a recipe for success for a retailer.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/markets-look-to-howard-lutnick-other-trump-economic-picks-for-signals-on-tariffs-180200546.html,"Tue, Nov 19, 2024, 12:48 PM","Donald Trump has been somewhat cagey about his economic and tariff plans since voters elected him president, raising the stakes in a drawn-out contest to lead his economic team while focusing Wall Street's attention on other key posts. And Tuesday offered at least one clue about his direction with one of the tariff-friendliest voices in Trump's orbit, Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick, being announced as the next commerce secretary. Lutnick will, as President-elect Trump put it in the announcement, ""lead our Tariff and Trade agenda."" If confirmed, Lutnick would indeed have a key trade role at the department heading up many enforcement efforts and leading any review process of tariffs Trump aims to impose. Trump also announced Tuesday that Lutnick will have ""direct responsibility"" for the US Trade Representative. It's a key step, but investors are likely to have many additional questions, especially in terms of who Trump puts in the bigger job of Treasury secretary. ""Investors are on edge regarding ... Trump's Treasury Secretary pick and what it might signal about the balance of power within the administration on economic policy,"" wrote Evercore ISI in a note to clients this week. Indeed, reactions to that ongoing selection process suggest that markets have questions about the market-friendliness of Trump's coming administration. Trump is expected to meet with additional candidates for that top post this week — with the chance of a wild card always a distinct possibility. Perhaps channeling the market's desire for some amount of certainty, BTIG director of policy research Isaac Boltansky added in a recent live Yahoo Finance appearance that ""I hope by the end of the week we know who the treasury secretary nominee is."" The unease among business leaders is particularly acute around tariffs and comes after Trump talked about those import duties multiple times a day on the campaign trail. He has been much more circumspect on that subject in recent weeks. The president-elect appeared last Thursday at a gala in Florida and gave a speech that reprised many campaign promises, from cutting energy prices ""in half"" to letting Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ""go wild"" on health issues. But he notably avoided much in the way of economic policy — and didn't get into trade issues at all. In fact, Trump's comments in Tuesday's announcement of Lutnick have been one of his only public comments on the tariff topic in weeks. But trade, in particular, is top of mind for businesses. Retailers have already begun to shift their plans, as have other businesses, but others have little choice but to wait for signals. Any concrete sign from Trump ""is going to be incredibly influential ... because right now, firms are operating in a bit of a vacuum trying to figure out whether or not he's still committed to double-digit, across-the-board tariffs,"" said Wendy Edelberg, director of the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution, in a recent interview. During the campaign, Trump promised 60% tariffs on China as well as 10%-20% blanket duties on other trading partners as he again and again extolled tariffs as ""the most beautiful word in the dictionary."" Edelberg predicts that any concrete signal as to whether he intends to follow through will lead many businesses to respond ""quite quickly and aggressively."" Other countries are also being left in suspense. Adam Posen, the president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, offered up in a recent digital event that ""the governments of major economies are making plans to sort of preemptively make offers of various kinds to the Trump administration"" — citing increased natural gas purchases as one carrot to offer in return for backing off tariffs. The question is whether Trump's eventual complete team will be receptive. A ""number of the people close to the president-elect believe trade deficits are a really big deal,"" Posen said, and smaller concessions like energy purchases are unlikely to be satisfying on that front. What's also unclear is who will be atop Trump's team at the Treasury Department as jockeying for that post continues and other preeminent positions remain unfilled, notably the director of the National Economic Council. That latter position is often described as a president's top economic adviser. Trump has also not yet announced a pick for his trade representative, another figure who will be front and center in any tariff conversations alongside Howard Lutnick. Trump is expected to meet with two new treasury candidates — former Federal Reserve governor Kevin Warsh and Apollo Global Management CEO Marc Rowan — in the coming days. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management). Two other contenders appear to be Scott Bessent, a former Soros Fund Management investing chief, and Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee. Lutnick had been seen as a top treasury choice as recently as last week but saw his stock fall there and is now headed to the Commerce department instead. He nonetheless gained considerable attention for pro-tariff comments during the campaign. ""When was America great?"" he asked the crowd at Madison Square Garden before the election and before discussing the 1890s as an era before income taxes when ""all we had was tariffs"" and the economy was ""rocking."" BTIG's Boltansky said in a recent Yahoo Finance appearance that ""if we have Bessent as the pick, I think that it's going to reinforce what many of us, including myself, believe, which is that the market is ultimately going to be a governor on some of Trump's policy moves."" Bessent has written favorably on tariffs but for ""strategically important industries."" The other candidates, Boltansky added, would fall somewhere in between Bessent and Lutnick, who had been seen as possibly signaling ""a more aggressive pushing on the tariff side of the story and perhaps not as much interest in near-term volatility in markets."" Evercore ISI in its note this week cited Bessent as ""the investor favorite"" and noted a Bloomberg report that Bessent could be headed to the National Economic Council and said it could calm some market fears if that comes to be. But the authors were quick to note that there is little sense that uncertainty will go away entirely even once Trump posts his Treasury pick on Truth Social. ""Questions will remain over how much influence this person will actually have over an administration in which the President firmly embraces tariffs,"" they note.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/a-big-wall-street-winner-from-trumps-bitcoin-bump-blackrock-111834321.html,"Mon, Nov 18, 2024, 3:18 AM","BlackRock (BLK) CEO Larry Fink was once a ""proud skeptic"" of bitcoin, but now his money management giant is emerging as one of the biggest beneficiaries of a post-election surge in enthusiasm for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. BlackRock’s spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (IBIT) has swelled by $13 billion since Donald Trump’s win on Nov. 5, according to Yahoo Finance data, pushing iShares Bitcoin Trust past $40 billion in assets just 10 months following its launch. That feat places IBIT among the top 1% of biggest ETFs in record time, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas. ""We had pretty optimistic projections, but, you know, I don't think anyone's ever going to put down as their base or even, maybe, their bull case that year one is going to rewrite the record book on inflows into the ETF category,"" Robbie Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, said last week on the Unchained podcast. Plenty of other companies are also benefiting from the new boom as investors bet that pro-crypto legislation could be possible in Washington, D.C., under a new Trump administration and a GOP-controlled Congress. Read more: Bitcoin clears another record: Is this a good time to invest? The stock of Coinbase (COIN), the biggest US cryptocurrency exchange, is up 58% since the election. The stock of MicroStrategy (MSTR), a software company that became the largest corporate bitcoin holder, is up 50%. The record inflows to BlackRock illustrate how crypto continues to move into the investing mainstream as it gets embraced by some of the biggest names on Wall Street — even some who were once its biggest critics. Fink, who runs the world’s biggest money manager, falls into that category. ""I was a proud skeptic, and I studied it, learned about it, and I came away saying, 'OK, you know, my opinion [for] five years was wrong,'"" Fink said earlier this year while discussing his previous views with CNBC. Perhaps the best example of that shift came in June 2023 when BlackRock filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a spot bitcoin ETF. That was back when the crypto and asset management industries had little evidence such a product would be approved by SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Yet it and 10 other money managers got the green light in January, followed by a listing on Jan. 12. “BlackRock always seems to be in the right place,” Stephen Biggar, an analyst with Argus Research who covers the asset manager, told Yahoo Finance. Its embrace of crypto (it also launched a smaller spot ether ETF in late July) coincided with an election year where pro-crypto congressional candidates received millions in industry donations and Trump, as a candidate, made a number of promises to the industry. Trump pledged to fire SEC Chair Gensler, one of the industry’s greatest antagonists, appoint a crypto presidential advisory council, and establish a ""strategic national bitcoin stockpile"" with the help of Congress. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) then surged to a new all-time high above $93,000 in the week following Trump’s victory before giving up some of those gains. It is now up 30% since the election and 112% so far in 2024. On the Thursday after the election, spot bitcoin ETFs saw a record $1.3 billion in net assets pour in, according to Kaiko Research, and BlackRock reaped 85% of that total. Its two crypto ETFs now represent approximately 42% of the total $102 billion of value in spot crypto ETFs across the industry. “The amazing thing about this story is that it takes so long to build a good base,” Balchunas told Yahoo Finance. “And they did it so quickly that they were in such a good position to benefit from this rally."" BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust could rake in even more money from investors now that it has crossed the $40 billion threshold, as financial advisers succumb to the fear of missing out. “There could come a point where advisers decide 'I should have it to avoid getting fired' versus 'I don’t want to buy it and get my client mad for having some dumb bitcoin ETF,'"" Balchunas said. Such a ""tipping point"" would certainly spark a new wave of mainstream embrace of crypto, he added.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/my-trump-trade-went-bust--with-a-consolation-prize-200414417.html,"Mon, Nov 18, 2024, 12:04 PM","I bet against Donald Trump, and lost. I got ahead, anyway. In the final days of the 2024 US election, the “Trump trade” was getting woolly. Investors who thought Trump would win or lose the presidential race were betting for or against the impact his economic policies might have. New tariffs on imports might be bad for shippers and good for domestic producers. Tax cuts could generate larger deficits and higher interest rates. Deregulation could yield more corporate mergers. The most direct Trump trade was a bet on the shares of Trump’s own company, Trump Media & Technology Group, known by its ticker symbol DJT. A Trump win could boost the fortunes of the flagging Truth Social network, while a Trump loss could doom the money-losing venture. The stock price was yo-yoing based on every hint that Trump was up or down in the polls. I decided to sample the action. I wanted to place an options trade on DJT, because that’s the way many other Trump traders were playing it. I’m a plain vanilla investor, so I asked Eric Hale, founder and CEO of Trader Oasis, to guide me through an options trade. I didn’t know if Trump would win or lose, but I thought shares of DJT, which had been trading around $50, were seriously overpriced. The company was a social media pipsqueak with barely any revenue, yet the stock price gave it a market value of $8 billion. That seemed way too high under any election outcome. I bought a put contract with a strike price of $25, which meant I could sell 100 shares at a profit if the price fell below $25 before my contract expired on Nov. 15. The contract cost $3.90 per share for 100 shares, so $390 in total. I’d make a profit of about $1,110 if the price dropped to $10, and $2,500 if it went to 0. If the price never fell below $25 by Nov. 15, I’d be out the full $390. For a few days, it looked promising. The stock closed at $40 the day I bought my put. It fell to nearly $30 the following day, which pushed the market value of the put higher than what I paid for it. I could have closed the trade then for a small profit. But I wanted to go the distance. Trump won, of course, which should have demolished my Trump trade. But instead of soaring after Trump’s win — which was the expectation trading action had been signaling — the stock languished. There was a brief uptick once the election outcome was clear, but then the stock fell to $30, then $27. A couple of bucks lower and I’d get back at least get some of my money. Drop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter. On Nov. 15, the day my put expired, the stock crawled back to about $28. I was out of luck and my $390 was gone. It was my second failure to capitalize on an investing fad. In 2021, I tried my hand at meme stock investing by buying shares of BlackBerry. I went underwater right away and ended up losing $1,760. Other Trump traders hit the jackpot. The “French whale” who wagered $70 million on a Trump win on the betting site Polymarket took home an $85 million profit. Big bank shareholders saw handsome gains on the likelihood of softer regulation. Anybody who owned the beaten-down shares of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac enjoyed a 70% pop on hopes that Trump will privatize the two federal housing agencies. I should swear off trendy investing ideas, except I got it right once. I bought a bit of cryptocurrency during the heady days of 2017, when bitcoin was starting to garner mainstream attention. A year or two later, I bought stock in a crypto-related company. Trump’s win in 2024 turned out to be bullish for crypto, since he’s promised friendly policies. I didn’t plan it this way, but my crypto gains offset the $390 loss, and then some, and then some more. My Trump trade also gave me a rudimentary understanding of how to place option trades. My main takeaway: Leave it to the pros. But if I get laid off and decide to become a day trader, I got a wee bit of starter education. I also paid closer attention to Trump’s company than I would have if I'd had no stake in it. The stock jumped after Trump said on Nov. 8 that he had no plan to sell his shares, as some of the company’s backers had feared. But other company insiders did sell shares, which seemed to drag down the stock.

The news comes ahead of the AI chipmaker's earnings report, which is slated for release after the market close on Wednesday. It's not the first time issues have been reported with the company's Blackwell products. In August, the Information reported that the leading AI chipmaker was dealing with design flaws related to the individual Blackwell chips themselves. Nvidia confirmed fears that Blackwell production would be delayed in its earnings report in late August, stating that production of the chips would ramp up in the December quarter rather than its previously stated goal to ramp during the September period. The company has not publicly confirmed any design flaws or overheating issues. Nvidia told Yahoo Finance about its latest AI servers: ""The engineering iterations are normal and expected."" Nvidia's so-called GB200 NVL72 server system uses 72 Blackwell chips and 36 of its latest Grace CPUs. Nvidia said the servers are ""the most advanced computers ever created."" Those Blackwell chips are set to bring in ""several billion dollars"" in sales in the company's fiscal fourth quarter, according to CEO Jensen Huang. Customers looking to use the Blackwell server system include Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Elon Musk's xAI, according to the Information. Despite reported issues, Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell noted in a post on X Monday, following the Information's report, that Dell is already shipping an unspecified number of Nvidia's Blackwell servers as part of its latest AI hardware product, the PowerEdge System. Nvidia shares closed Monday down 1.3% to $140.15. As Yahoo Finance’s Dan Howley noted last week, even a stellar report and outlook from the company Wednesday could send its stock down further. Nvidia topped expectations across the board in its most recent quarterly report, for example, but shares still fell 6% immediately after it announced its results in late August. Investor excitement over AI spending has also stoked fears Big Tech’s AI spending will ease — or sharply decline — punching AI chip companies in the gut. Such fears were on display last Friday, when chip stocks fell across the board after a disappointing earnings report from Applied Materials (AMAT), which makes tech used by TSMC (TSM) to manufacture advanced computing chips such as Nvidia’s. Nvidia shares closed Friday down 3.3%, while the PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX) fell 3.4%. Still, Nvidia shares are up roughly 186% from last year. The chipmaker's monumental rise has pushed it past Apple (AAPL) as the world's most valuable company, and Nvidia recently replaced Intel on the Dow.

Bitcoin prices held steady over the weekend around $91,000 after last week's surge sent prices for the world's largest cryptocurrency above $80,000 and then $90,000 for the first time. Bitcoin has been a key component of the ""Trump trade,"" as President-elect Donald Trump has promised to explore crypto-friendly policies, including the creation of a bitcoin national stockpile. Bitcoin spot ETFs have also seen massive inflows in recent weeks. As Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reported earlier this week, BlackRock’s spot bitcoin ETF (IBIT) saw its assets rise by $13 billion in the wake of Trump's win on Nov. 5, according to Yahoo Finance data. This pushed assets in the iShares Bitcoin Trust past $40 billion just 10 months after its launch. Options tied to IBIT also began trading on the Nasdaq on Tuesday, pushing additional trading activity into the crypto space. The move higher also comes on the heels of a Financial Times report stating that Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) is in advanced talks to acquire crypto trading company Bakkt (BKKT), a tie-up that could further encourage initiatives within the sector. Crypto-related stocks like trading platforms Coinbase (COIN) and Robinhood (HOOD) have also benefited from the recent rally, gaining 65% and 42% over the past 10 days, respectively. Bitcoin proxy MicroStrategy (MSTR) touched new record highs on Tuesday.

Nvidia (NVDA) mania is heating up ahead of the market darling's Wednesday earnings report. The company is “representative of the most important stocks in America,” EMJ Capital founder and president Eric Jackson told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (listen in below; video above). Jackson reiterated his call that Nvidia's stock could double within the next twelve months given its wide lead on AI chip production. “The investments [in AI] are just getting started,” Jackson added. “The need for these chips is still going to continue for the next year or two or three.” Nvidia's stock has surged more than 2,600% in the past five years according to Yahoo Finance data, fueled by one impressive quarter after another as it grabbed the top position in cutting-edge chips. The company's strong performance are expected to continue in its fiscal third quarter — sales and profits are each estimated to be up 83% from a year ago. Wall Street remains bullish on its favorite stock. Of the 63 sell-side analysts that cover Nvidia, 59 rate the stock a buy or strong buy, Yahoo Finance data shows. The average price target stands at $160.38, about 13% above current levels. ""We see the near-term risks as largely balanced and we are buyers of Nvidia heading into its fiscal third quarter earnings report scheduled for Wednesday. Positive set-up indicators from accelerating bookings at cloud service providers, an upward bias on hyper-scale capital expenditures, as well as our view that near-term estimates will increase post the earnings call,"" Evercore ISI analyst Mark Lipacis said in a client note on Monday. Lipacis says if Nvidia were to let investors down, it would come in the form of decelerating revenue growth. There has been a whirlwind of activity around Nvidia as of late. In addition to achieving world's most valuable company status by nudging out Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG), Nvidia joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Nov. 8. Former chip leader Intel (INTC) was kicked out. “It’s good that Nvidia is part of the mix now,” Jackson said, noting it could encourage purchases from retail investors. One potential hiccup is the restrictions around selling to China by the Biden administration and subsequent write downs which were a “meaningful part of their quarterly earnings,” Jackson said. “They had to take it down to zero.” Incoming president Donald Trump could stay firm on the chip issue as well, making good on his campaign promises around China. ""The good news for investors is that they’ve written everything down and so if anything comes from the relationship with China and Nvidia, it’s going to be great,” Jackson said. Wall Street will be hard pressed to downgrade Nvidia's stock in the medium-term. “The revenue monetization opportunity is so much greater [than investors appreciate],” Bank of America analyst and Nvidia bull Vivek Arya told Sozzi on Opening Bid. Key drivers for Arya's bullish Nvidia call include coming next-generation AI chips — Blackwell Ultra, Rubin, and Rubin Ultra. Those offerings will begin hitting the market in the third quarter of 2025 based on Arya's analysis. Grace L. Williams is a writer for Yahoo Finance.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/comcast-announces-plan-to-spin-off-tv-networks-including-msnbc-cnbc-to-play-offense-in-new-media-landscape-140003512.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 1:03 PM","Comcast (CMCSA) confirmed plans to spin off most of its cable networks into a new, publicly traded company as it and others in the industry grapple with more consumers cutting the cord. The yet-to-be-named SpinCo will house most of NBCUniversal’s cable television networks, including USA Network, CNBC, MSNBC, Oxygen, E!, SYFY, and Golf Channel. Those networks collectively generated approximately $7 billion in revenue over the 12 months ended Sept. 30, Comcast said in its announcement. Comcast's Peacock streaming service, NBC News, the NBC broadcast network, and the Bravo channel will remain under the parent company. ""We are uniquely positioned to set both SpinCo and NBCUniversal up to play offense in a complex and evolving media landscape,” Comcast president Mike Cavanagh said in an internal memo to employees Wednesday. Comcast stock popped more than 3% premarket before paring gains. Shares closed the trading day up 1.6% to roughly $43. The company said it is looking to complete the spin-off in one year. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are advising the company on the transaction. ""Our effort to launch SpinCo as a successful public company will be done well versus done quickly,"" Cavanagh wrote. Comcast said that after the spin-off, NBCUniversal will continue to receive about $40 billion in annual content and experiences revenue. The change will create a shakeup in Comcast's corporate leadership. NBCUniversal Media Group chairman Mark Lazarus will assume the role of CEO of SpinCo. Anand Kini, the CFO of NBCUniversal, will now serve as SpinCo’s CFO. Meanwhile, Matt Strauss, the head of Comcast's direct-to-consumer business, will take over as chair of NBCUniversal Media Group, and chief content officer Donna Langley will assume the role of chairman of NBCUniversal Entertainment and Studios. “As a standalone company with these outstanding assets, we will be better positioned to serve our audiences and drive shareholder returns in this incredibly dynamic media environment across news, sports, and entertainment,” Lazarus said. “We see a real opportunity to invest and build additional scale and I'm excited about the growth opportunities this transition will unlock.” “Our financial strength will also provide capacity for an attractive capital return policy while allowing for investment in the growth of these businesses.” Comcast said in late October that it had begun to explore spinning off its cable TV networks into a separate business, sending the stock up more than 3% the same day, Yahoo Finance’s Alexandra Canal reported at the time. Ross Benes, principal analyst at eMarketer, said in October that a spin-off would make sense for the company, which has been laser-focused on beefing up its broadband capabilities and its streaming business amid a struggling cable TV industry. ""Spinning cable networks into their own company will make it easier for Comcast to cleave off its TV properties and sell them,"" Benes wrote in October. ""Comcast profits are driven by its internet service provider (ISP) side. Other [multichannel video programming distributors] have pulled back their TV ambitions, and it would make sense for Comcast to do the same."" ""Dividing the TV networks from the rest of the company will allow Comcast to more clearly show growth in its ISP business,"" the analyst added.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-win-has-economists-concerned-us-economy-will-fail-to-make-soft-landing-143026767.html,"Sun, Nov 17, 2024, 9:26 AM","Investors this year have grown increasingly confident the US economy will achieve a ""soft landing."" But the election of Donald Trump as the nation's next president has complicated the outlook. And some economists now think it's likely the US could face another inflation resurgence if Trump follows through with his key campaign promises. ""We are in the soft landing,"" Nobel prize-winning economist and Columbia University professor Joseph Stiglitz said at Yahoo Finance's annual Invest conference on Tuesday. ""But that ends Jan. 20."" Trump and his proposed policies have been viewed as potentially more inflationary due to the president-elect's campaign promises of high tariffs on imported goods, tax cuts for corporations, and curbs on immigration. Those policies could also pressure an already bloated federal deficit, further complicating the Federal Reserve's path forward for interest rates. ""The biggest risk is a large across-the-board tariff, which would likely hit growth hard,"" Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. Jennifer McKeown, chief global economist at Capital Economics, also acknowledged in a note this week there are ""upside risks"" to inflation ""stemming partly from Trump’s proposed tariff and immigration policies."" And investors have taken notice. On Wednesday, the latest Global Fund Manager Survey from Bank of America highlighted increased expectations of a ""no landing"" scenario, in which the economy continues to grow but inflation pressures persist, leading to a higher-for-longer interest rate policy from the central bank. Tariffs have been one of the most talked-about promises of Trump's campaign. The president-elect has pledged to impose blanket tariffs of at least 10% on all trading partners, including a 60% tariff on Chinese imports. ""It will be inflationary,"" Stiglitz said. ""And then you start thinking of the inflationary spiral. The prices go up. Workers will want more wages. And then you start thinking of what happens if others retaliate [with their own duties.]"" Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari categorized a possible retaliation as a ""tit-for-tat"" trade war, which would keep inflation elevated over the long term. ""If inflation goes up, [Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell] is going to raise interest rates,"" Stiglitz said. ""You combine the higher interest rates and the retaliation from other countries, you're going to get a global slowdown. Then you have the worst of all possible worlds: inflation and stagnation, or slow growth."" Investors have dialed back rate cut expectations in preparation. Since the Fed's first rate cut on Sept. 18, markets now expect three fewer rate cuts between now and the end of next year, per the CME's FedWatch Tool. But the US economy has remained resilient in the face of high interest rates. Retail sales once again topped estimates for the month of October, GDP remains strong, the unemployment rate continues to hover at around 4%, and inflation has moderated despite its bumpy path down to 2%. Additionally, it remains unclear which policies will be a priority once Trump takes office or if he'll fully commit to the promises he's already made. The only certainty is change. In 2025, the GOP has not only secured the White House but also maintained control of the House of Representatives and flipped the Senate. ""The Republican sweep in the elections is likely to bring sweeping policy changes,"" Bank of America's US economics team wrote in a client note on Friday. ""There are plausible scenarios in which growth could run above 3%, or the economy could enter a recession,"" the team said. ""Our base case is sanguine, but our conviction is low.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-forecasts-normal-year-for-stocks-in-2025-after-historic-rally-182124444.html,"Mon, Nov 18, 2024, 10:21 AM","After two years of annual gains north of 20% for the S&P 500 (^GSPC), Wall Street strategists think 2025 will see a more measured year for stocks. On Monday, BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski initiated a 2025 year-end target of 6,700 for the S&P 500. On Sunday, Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson issued a 12-month target of 6,500 for the S&P 500. Belski's target reflects about 14% upside from Friday's close; the strategist already has a 6,100 year-end target for 2024. This puts Belski's forecast for returns in 2025 at 9.8%, right in line with the index's average historical gain. Wilson's 12-month target represents a nearly 11% increase for the benchmark index over the next year. Should the S&P 500 finish 2024 with a gain above 20%, it would mark the first time the benchmark index has posted consecutive years with gains of 20% or more since the tech bubble of 1998-1999. Any way you slice it, then, these outlooks say the outsized returns the S&P 500 has enjoyed for each of the past two years will come to an end in 2025. ""It is clearly time for markets to take a somewhat of a breather,"" Belski wrote. ""Bull markets can, will and should slow their pace from time-to-time, a period of digestion that in turn only accentuates the health of the underlying secular bull. So we believe 2025 will likely [be] defined by a more normalized return environment with more balanced performance across sectors, sizes, and styles."" Belski points out that the historical pattern for bull markets sees returns in year three come in below gains for the first two years and below the index's typical average return. ""Now that inflation, interest rates (zero percent is NOT normal) and employment are showing signs of stabilizing (volatility diminishing), US stock fundamentals have their best chance to normalize,"" Belski wrote. ""According to our work, an environment of high single digit annual price gains coupled with at or near double digit earnings growth and price to earnings ratios in the high teens to low twenties over the next few years would be a good start on the path to normalization."" With the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates while US economic growth remains strong, both Belski and Wilson believe in a continued broadening of the stock market rally, where more than just a few high-flying tech names are driving the market action. ""We expect this broadening in earnings growth to continue as the Fed cuts rates into next year and business cycle indicators continue to improve,"" Wilson wrote. ""A potential rise in corporate animal spirits post the election could catalyze a more balanced earnings profile across the market in 2025."" Wilson and Belski agree that this likely creates stock-picking opportunities beneath the surface of the S&P 500. But it could also be part of what leads to lower returns at the index level, with smaller stocks by definition having less of an impact on the movement of the overall index. ""We believe the slight [second half of 2024] rotation out of technology+ mega cap stocks is a trend that will likely continue and if so, the sheer size of the stocks within the index will make big market gains more difficult (but not impossible) to achieve as the rest of the S&P 500 plays the catch-up game,"" Belski wrote.

The company — which partners with Nvidia (NVDA) to provide high-tech servers with its AI chips and recently scored a major deal to supply those servers to Elon Musk's xAI — said its compliance plan shows it is on track to submit delayed filings to the SEC ""and become current with its periodic reports within the discretionary period available to the Nasdaq staff to grant."" Investors eagerly awaited the filing following a Barron’s report on Friday after the bell, which stated that Super Micro would submit its plan to prevent delisting by the deadline on Monday per Nasdaq rules, citing people familiar with the matter. The stock surged roughly 16% during regular trading Monday. The server maker also said Monday that the company has hired a new auditor, BDO, after its prior accountant, EY, resigned in late October. Even with this week's surge, shares have tumbled roughly 56% over the past three months. After gaining as much as 300% earlier this year, SMCI stock is now down over 20% in 2024. Super Micro has been grappling with the fallout from an August report by short seller firm Hindenburg Research, which shed light on alleged accounting malpractices, violations of export controls, and shady relationships between top executives and Super Micro partners. Following the Hindenburg report, the company delayed its annual 10-K filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission. And last week, Super Micro also delayed filing its most recent quarterly 10-Q report to the SEC. Adding to its woes, the company is reportedly being investigated by the Department of Justice. The barrage of bad news sent shares tumbling — EY’s resignation, in particular, pushed Super Micro stock down more than 30% in a single day in late October. Shares of the company also fell sharply following Super Micro’s fiscal first quarter earnings report on Nov. 5, which missed Wall Street’s expectations, sending shares down 18% on the day following the results. Super Micro rose to prominence over the past year as the generative artificial intelligence boom propelled sales for its AI servers and other AI-related tech. In its fiscal year 2024, Super Micro’s adjusted earnings rose nearly 90% to $2.21 per share, and revenue soared 110% to $15 billion. Analysts expect the company’s earnings to grow more than 40% in the 2025 fiscal year, and they see sales surging just over 70%. Elsewhere on Monday, the server maker announced product updates during the Supercomputing Conference in Atlanta, including its next-generation AI servers using Nvidia Blackwell chips. ""Supermicro has the expertise, delivery speed, and capacity to deploy the largest liquid-cooled AI data center projects in the world, containing 100,000 GPUs, which Supermicro and NVIDIA contributed to and recently deployed,"" Super Micro CEO Charles Liang wrote in a statement on Monday.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell 0.2%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was up 0.4%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.6%, buoyed by a jump in Tesla stock. Stocks started the week trying to break out of a funk, which saw the S&P 500 reverse around half of its Trump-fueled rally after sharp weekly losses for the major gauges, led by tech. Signs of a robust economy, combined with comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, have prompted investors to downsize expectations for rate cuts. But the tech sector showed signs of a comeback Monday, with EV maker Tesla leading the way, rising more than 5% in the wake of a Bloomberg report that President-elect Donald Trump's team is looking to ease US rules for self-driving vehicles. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards Elsewhere in tech, eyes are now on Nvidia's earnings report on Wednesday for insight into the strength of the AI trade, which has helped drive the S&P 500's gains over the past year. Shares slipped slightly on Monday as production of its flagship Blackwell chip came into focus. Wall Street also continues to monitor Trump's picks for his cabinet, after his choice of Robert F. Kennedy Jr for top health official rattled vaccine stocks. The incoming president has named Brendan Carr, a critic of Big Techs such as Meta and Apple, as chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. The wait is now on to learn who will win the frenzied race to become Trump's Treasury secretary. Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) gained 16% in afternoon trading after The Financial Times reported the parent company of Truth Social is in talks to acquire crypto trading venue Bakkt (BKKT). Shares of Bakkt soared more than 169% on the headline. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) — also a key Trump trade — has rebounded from its biggest retreat since the election at the weekend. The cryptocurrency was trading above $91,000 on Monday.

Nvidia shares closed the session down more than 1% ahead of the AI chipmaker's earnings due on Wednesday. Energy (XLE) stocks rose as oil jumped more than 3% after following a production halt at Norway's largest oilfield. An escalation of the Ukraine-Russia war also sent crude futures higher. Trump Media (DJT) is reportedly in advanced talks to buy cryptocurrency trading platform Bakkt (BKKT), according to the Financial Times. Shares of Bakkt, up 162% on the headline, were halted for volatility on Monday afternoon. The trading venue is owned by Intercontinental Exchange, Trump Media and Technology Group shares also gained about 16% in afternoon trading. Super Micro Computer (SMCI) gained as much as 25% as investors awaited a filing or plan from the server and storage vendor in order to avoid being delisted. The company must either submit its delayed 10-K annual financials filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission or plan to regain compliance with the Nasdaq. In August, Super Micro delayed the release of its annual report. Last month its auditor, Ernst & Young, resigned. Year to date, the stock is down about 19% after reaching an all-time high in March amid investors' euphoria over AI. Gold (GC=F) futures rose more than 1.5% to hover above $2,615 per ounce as the US dollar paused its recent rally and the Ukraine-Russia war escalated, prompting investors to flock to the asset traditionally considered a safe haven during times of geopolitical risks. The precious metal rose after the Biden administration authorized Ukraine to use US-made long-range missiles to strike deep into Russia. The US Dollar Index (DX-Y.NYB) which has been on a steady climb since the US elections, eased slightly on Monday, also helping lift gold prices. On Sunday Goldman Sachs analysts recommended investors go ""long gold"" as central banks continue to buy up the asset. Gold had been on a tear up until the US elections. It has since fallen as the US dollar has risen over the past week. ""The gold price consolidation following the orderly US election — flushing speculative positioning from near all-time highs — provides an attractive entry point to buy gold,"" wrote Goldman analysts. After two years of annual gains north of 20% for the S&P 500 (^GSPC), Wall Street strategists think 2025 will see a more measured year for stocks. On Monday, BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski initiated a 2025 year-end target of 6,700 for the S&P 500. On Sunday, Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson issued a 12-month target of 6,500 for the S&P 500. Belski's target reflects about 14% upside from Friday's close; the strategist already has a 6,100 year-end target for 2024. This puts Belski's forecast for returns in 2025 at 9.8%, right in line with the index's average historical gain. Wilson's 12-month target represents a nearly 11% increase for the benchmark index over the next year. Should the S&P 500 finish 2024 with a gain above 20%, it would mark the first time the benchmark index has posted consecutive years with gains of 20% or more since the tech bubble of 1998-1999. Any way you slice it, then, these outlooks say the outsized returns the S&P 500 has enjoyed for each of the past two years will come to an end in 2025. ""It is clearly time for markets to take a somewhat of a breather,"" Belski wrote. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reports. The contest for treasury secretary is emerging as a key stumbling block in Donald Trump's presidential transition as candidates rise and fall by the day and top advisers make their arguments before millions of followers. Last week, the top contenders appeared to be Howard Lutnick, CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, and Scott Bessent, a former Soros Fund Management investing chief. But the water is now murkier than ever after a weekend of even more intense back-and-forth unlike anything surrounding Trump's other picks so far. Read more here. Oil jumped on Monday after crude production was halted at a massive oilfield in Norway due to a power outage, adding to surging prices following the Biden administration's authorization of US-made long-range missiles in the Ukraine-Russia war.

The operator of Norway's Johan Sverdrup field was working on reestablishing production on Monday. Crude was already on the rise on Monday morning after Reuters reported the Biden administration gave the green light for Ukraine to use US weapons to strike inside Russia. ""If mass causalities are noted a large geopolitical premium could be placed back on crude very quickly,"" Dennis Kissler, senior vice president at BOK Financial, said in a note on Monday. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal reports: Netflix (NFLX) shares recovered from earlier losses on Monday after the streaming giant's highly anticipated boxing event between heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and YouTube personality Jake Paul experienced technical glitches throughout the live broadcast.

Homebuilders rose following Donald Trump’s election victory, though expectations for the housing market still remained muted in November. The National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index rose 3 points to 46 in November, up from 43 from the previous month and marking the third consecutive monthly gain. November’s reading was higher than economists’ estimates of 43, according to Bloomberg data. Still, any reading under 50 indicates more builders view conditions as poor rather than good. “With the elections now in the rearview mirror, builders are expressing increasing confidence that Republicans gaining all the levers of power in Washington will result in significant regulatory relief for the industry that will lead to the construction of more homes and apartments,” NAHB chairman Carl Harris, a custom homebuilder from Wichita, Kan., wrote in a press statement. Meanwhile, mortgage rates continued their recent rise, with the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate loan holding at 6.78% last week from 6.79% a week earlier, according to Freddie Mac. Rates on a home loan tend to follow US Treasury yields, which have been rising since mid-September due in part to investors anticipating a Trump victory and his proposed policies around taxes and tariffs. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage fell as low as 6.08% in early September. ""While the stock market cheered the election result, the bond market has concerns, as indicated by a rise for long-term interest rates,"" said NAHB chief economist Robert Dietz. ""There is also policy uncertainty in front of the business sector and housing market as the executive branch changes hands."" The NAHB survey showed builders continue to offer concessions in November. The survey found that 60% of builders used some sort of sales incentive to close the deal, slightly lower than the 62% that used incentives in October. Meanwhile, 31% of builders cut home prices to bolster sales in November, unchanged since July. The average price reduction was 5%, slightly lower than 6% last month. The gauge measuring the sales outlook over the next six months rose 7 points to 64. The prospective-buyer traffic gauge gained 3 points, while the NAHB index of current sales conditions rose 2 points in November. The major averages opened mixed on Monday as investors focus on earnings from chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) later this week to test the strength of the AI trade, and determine the near-term direction of the market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) dipped 0.2% while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was flat. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.1% as Tesla (TSLA) jumped over the possibility of more relaxed autonomous driving rules under a Trump administration. Meanwhile, Nvidia will report earnings this Wednesday. On Monday, BofA analysts noted Nvidia ""remains the most dominant stock in the market, driving 20% of S&P 500 return over the past year, and is expected drive nearly 25% of the S&P 500's EPS growth in 3Q."" ""With the market taking a breather last week following the election rally, we believe NVDA earnings can dictate the near-term direction of the market,"" wrote the analysts.

Any tariffs imposed on China or Europe by Trump could impact the economy and the outlook for Fed policy. Goldman Sachs chief economist Jan Hatzius is out this morning downplaying the potential economic impact of tariffs. Hatzius reasons that tariffs would be more of a one-time hit to growth and inflation, and won't derail further rate cuts from the Fed in 2025. Hatzius says: To say expectations on Nvidia (NVDA) are sky high into its Wednesday earnings print is an understatement. They are super, extra sky high!

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stellantis-reveals-multi-energy-ev-truck-platform-thats-well-positioned-for-the-market-ceo-says-181507112.html,"Tue, Nov 19, 2024, 10:15 AM","Stellantis (STLA) revealed new details for its upcoming truck EV platform as the Big Three automaker attempts to revamp its flagging business. Stellantis — which counts Dodge, Ram, Jeep, and Fiat among its brands— will use the “STLA Frame” platform for its pickups and large SUVs that use electrified powertrains. The “body on frame” STLA Frame platform differs from the automaker’s other EV platforms (small, medium, large), which use traditional unibody construction. The STLA Frame is designed for full-size, body-on-frame trucks and SUVs, with the ability to support multi-energy solutions, mainly for battery electric (BEV) and range-extender electric vehicle (REEV) technologies, but also internal combustion, hybrid, and even hydrogen if needed. Stellantis — as opposed to GM (GM) and Ford (F) — is using a multi-energy platform for its trucks to meet its customers where they are, CEO Carlos Tavares said in a call with reporters. ""If you ask me if I would prefer a faster [EV] transition, I would say yes, I would prefer that. But we are not here to follow my 'guesstimations,' we are here to adapt to the market conditions and make the customers happy,"" Tavares said. Stellantis said the Frame platform will use dual electric drive motors (EDMs) for all-wheel drive capability and is targeting 500 miles of all-electric range for the BEV. The range-extender EV, which uses a gas-powered motor as a generator to charge the battery when it's depleted, will have an even larger range of 690 miles. Both the EV and the range-extender EV will have a 2,700-pound payload and 14,000-pound towing capacity. Ram and Jeep vehicles will be the first to use the STLA frame vehicle; Stellantis has already unveiled the new Ram 1500 REV EV pickup and Ramcharger range-extender pickup. While a Jeep EV using the STLA frame has not been announced, it's rumored that it will be a Wagoneer or Grand Wagoneer SUV variant. Tavares said the pickups would be on dealer lots in the first half of 2025, meaning the company missed its late 2024 deadline for the trucks. ""We don't want to take risks in terms of validation; it's very important for Stellantis to demonstrate that we have all the capabilities and that we master the technology with a high level of durability, and that's exactly what we are doing right now,"" Tavares said. The announcement for Stellantis’s latest EV platform comes at a difficult time for the automaker. Last month, Stellantis reported disappointing third quarter revenue and shipments and had earlier warned that profits would be significantly lower for the year compared to 2023 due to bloated inventory and deterioration in its US and China businesses. “We’re grinding through a transition here,” CFO Doug Ostermann said on the earnings call. Ostermann, who only just replaced outgoing CFO Natalie Knight in mid-October, is another new face at Stellantis. The automaker also said that CEO Carlos Tavares would be retiring after his contract ends in 2026 and that Jeep CEO Antonio Filosa will be adding North America COO to his duties, succeeding exec Carlos Zarlenga. Stellantis also said this month it would lay off 1,100 workers at its Jeep Gladiator plant in Ohio due to a sales decline for the off-road pickup, though an electrified hybrid version of the Gladiator is coming next year. The election of Donald Trump and his transition team’s stance on EVs may also be a headwind for Stellantis and other automakers betting on EVs. The Trump team is reportedly planning to eliminate the federal $7,500 tax credit for EVs when the new administration comes into power next year. Tavares believes Stellantis can still thrive because it has a nimble strategy in place. ""Let's recognize that with a multi-energy platform strategy, we are well positioned to adapt to very different market circumstances, and we could say regulatory circumstances, or any change,"" Tavares said when asked about Trump and the threat of losing government incentives. ""So from that perspective, the multi-energy characteristic is a great one."" Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance. You can follow him on X and on Instagram.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-the-affordable-care-act-is-in-real-trouble-this-time-140058363.html,"Sun, Nov 17, 2024, 6:00 AM","In the leadup to this month’s election, House Speaker Mike Johnson promised that Republicans would make “massive” changes to the Affordable Care Act if they won a government sweep. With a trifecta now in hand, the party will soon have its chance to make good on that vow. So far, GOP leaders have been vague about what exactly they might do. During his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, President-elect Donald Trump notoriously said he had only “concepts of a plan” for how to deal with the health care law, which his party failed to repeal and replace after a grueling, months-long effort during his first term in office. But there’s at least one key reason to think that this time will turn out differently: A major expansion of the Affordable Care Act’s insurance subsidies passed by the Biden administration is currently set to expire after 2025, which will lead to large premium and deductible increases for many Americans who get their health coverage through the program’s exchanges. That means Republicans could pare back Obamacare without lifting a finger. But the looming subsidy cliff might also give the party political cover to make broader changes that would otherwise be difficult for more moderate lawmakers to swallow. Democrats temporarily made Obamacare’s insurance tax credits more generous as part of President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan. Those changes to the law’s subsidies, which lower the cost of health coverage purchased on federal marketplaces, knocked premiums to zero for many lower-income families while further limiting their out-of-pocket expense. They also for the first time capped the price of insurance for Americans who earn more than 400% of the federal poverty line, equal to $124,800 for a family of four today. Since then, enrollment on the exchanges has jumped about 80%, from 11.9 million in 2021 to 21.4 million in 2024. Much of that growth came from poorer and moderate-income households, some of whom had previously fallen into the law’s coverage gap because they earned too little to qualify for marketplace subsidies but lived in states that declined to expand Medicaid. Democrats extended the changes through next year as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, but chose not to make them permanent in order to limit that legislation’s cost. Instead, lawmakers hoped that the beefed up subsidies could be renewed as part of the bigger negotiation over the tax code that’s looming next year, when parts of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are also set to expire. With Republicans in full control of the White House and Capitol Hill, however, a renewal seems unlikely. Allowing Biden’s subsidies to sunset would make Obamacare coverage more expensive across the board — Households currently pay 44% less for health plans on average than they would under the original law’s subsidy scheme, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. The think tank finds that a single 45-year-old making $40,000 a year would pay an extra 67% for a mid-tier silver plan, or $1,247 a year. A similar adult earning $65,000 a year would pay 17% more, or $941. Some larger, middle-class families could be facing thousands of dollars in sticker shock. The Urban Institute finds that among all households earning more than 400% of the poverty line, the cost of coverage would be $2,900 higher without the enhanced subsidies, since they’d once again be forced to pay their full premium without any government assistance. Experts expect price hikes would lead some Americans to drop their coverage, while others would downgrade to cheaper plans. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that in total, 3 million more Americans would likely go uninsured. “There’s a record number of people enrolled in the marketplaces right now,” said Sara Collins, a senior scholar and vice president for health coverage at the Commonwealth Fund. “Letting these enhanced marketplace premium tax credits expire would be a significant blow to low- and middle-income people who depend on them.” With fewer customers to spread around the costs of claims, insurance companies may also have to raise their premiums higher than if Biden’s subsidies remained in place. But the marketplaces aren’t likely to see the same kind of turbulence they did early on under Presidents Obama and Trump, when money-losing insurers dramatically increased their prices year-after-year and dropped out of some markets. “I’m not necessarily expecting a return to those really volatile days of premiums skyrocketing because that was driven by insurers being unprofitable and having to adjust,” said Kaiser Family Foundation vice president Cynthia Cox. Republicans may go beyond simply letting Biden’s enhanced subsidies expire. House Budget Committee Chair Jodey Arrington has called on his party to find savings in federal health care programs, and some members will likely eye cuts to the ACA or Medicaid as a way to offset the cost of their tax plans. While GOP lawmakers haven’t revealed much in the way of specific plans for Obamacare, the legislation they considered in 2017 may offer a guide. The party sought to slash spending on both the ACA and Medicaid by converting their currently unlimited funding into capped block grants to states that would grow more slowly than the programs are currently expected to. They also sought to loosen regulations requiring insurance companies to cover certain benefits. In September, Vice President-elect J.D. Vance suggested Republicans would also seek to allow insurance companies to separate healthy customers and people with pre-existing conditions into separate risk pools. That could make insurance cheaper for many families, but more expensive for those facing health problems. Jordan Weissmann is a senior reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/starbucks-ceo-aims-to-improve-employee-relationship-after-years-of-struggles-152037319.html,"Mon, Nov 18, 2024, 7:20 AM","Starbucks (SBUX) is trying to brew up a new chapter with its baristas as the coffee giant attempts a wider turnaround in its business and stock price under new CEO Brian Niccol. It has been nearly three years — and four CEOs — since the union labor movement rocked the business and a Starbucks in Buffalo won its vote to unionize, a first for the company. As of early November, there are 515 stores represented by Workers United out of nearly 17,000 US locations. Once a leader in worker benefits, Starbucks was accused of ""short staffing and unpredictable scheduling; low wages; unaffordable healthcare; harassment; broken equipment; unfair discipline"" by Workers United. Starbucks' problems have been taking a toll. Its limited-time offerings didn't succeed, and its value perception weakened. US and North American same-store sales dropped 6% in its latest quarter, while adjusted earnings per share plunged 24%. Year to date, the stock is up only 3%, compared to 23% for the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Starbucks shares trade on a trailing 12-month price-to-sales ratio of 3 times, below that of fellow coffee purveyors McDonald's (MCD), at 8 times, and Dutch Bros (BROS), at 3.7 times, according to Yahoo Finance's stock comparison tool. At Niccol's former employer, Chipotle (CMG), which is seen as more employee-friendly, shares are up 31% this year. BTIG analyst Peter Saleh said investors are focused on Starbucks solidifying solutions to free up baristas, improve a hectic environment, and get the equipment needed to efficiently execute a complex menu. ""So long as their wages are competitive, ... their benefits are in line, much better than the industry ... and they provide some of the things that Brian's already doing, which is trying to make [a barista's] life a little bit easier,"" Saleh told Yahoo Finance. Niccol said the team has made progress toward alleviating key complaints from workers. The former Taco Bell chief is adding staff at 3,000 stores to see if it helps during the morning rush while finding the ""right algorithm"" to support mobile and drive-through orders. Store crews want to ""get back to making great coffee, make it easy for our customers to get coffee, [and] make it easy for us to move the products between mobile order and in-cafe,"" Niccol exclusively told Yahoo Finance (video above) about the feedback he got when visiting cafes after joining the coffee chain in September. He's also prioritizing the Siren Craft System, a series of equipment and process improvements introduced under ousted CEO Laxman Narasimhan in September 2022. Narasimhan had planned for 10% of US locations to have the full suite by the end of 2024. The system is intended to improve employees' working experience and customer wait times, but Narasimhan didn't ""double down and roll it out,"" Saleh said. As sales fell, Wall Street grew impatient. ""The Siren system, which has been put on the back burner by Laxman, is now being put on the front burner ... by Brian,"" Saleh said. Starbucks baristas have long complained about increasingly complex drink menus clogging up the process and leaving customers waiting. On Starbucks' latest earnings call, Niccol said, ""Part of the reason why I think we've zigged and zagged on that Siren Craft System is because we didn't have clarity on what problem we were trying to solve."" He identified bottlenecks including warming food in the oven, making cold beverages, and fulfilling digital orders through four channels — in-cafe, mobile order and pay, drive-through, and delivery. If a ""store requires a full Siren Craft System, put it in. If it requires some pieces of it, put that in. If it just requires staffing and better deployment, we'll implement that,"" he said of his approach. Niccol also told Yahoo Finance he's working to improve the career roadmap for employees, though no details were shared. ""It's important to get to this 90% promote within,"" Niccol said. He made a similar move at Chipotle. Starbucks plans to have 55,000 locations worldwide by 2030, so solving worker issues is mission-critical. Today, there are 40,199 stores in operation. Investing in employees is crucial to boosting financial results experts say, along with improving in-store experience and service speed. Niccol had set a goal of fulfilling each drink order in four minutes or less. ""Restaurants with the least amount of turnover ... from the manager on down to the hourly employees, perform the best in terms of same-store sales growth,"" Saleh said. ""When you have less turnover, there's less investment or spend on training ... your margins tend to improve."" Meanwhile, unionization talks have gone on behind closed doors after the two parties agreed on a path forward in February. ""We continue to make significant progress at the bargaining table where we are addressing issues like staffing, pay,"" bargaining delegate and 14-year barista Michelle Eisen told Yahoo Finance. Baristas' voices are ""critical"" to Starbucks’ success in rebuilding, she noted. When asked about Niccol, Eisen said it's ""great"" that Starbucks is ""investing in leadership,"" but she added that ""now they need to invest in workers all the way down."" When Yahoo Finance asked Niccol about his thoughts on unionization efforts in recent years, he avoided answering the subject. — Brooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/were-concerned-walmart-lowes-among-latest-companies-to-warn-trump-tariffs-could-raise-product-costs-090030254.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 1:00 AM","Major American retailers Walmart (WMT) and Lowe’s (LOW) raised concerns that President-elect Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs would make their products more expensive, just as consumers are beginning to recover from the impacts of inflation. Walmart CFO John David Rainey hinted in an interview with Yahoo Finance’s Brian Sozzi on Tuesday that Trump’s tariff promises would prompt the retailer to hike costs, pointing to the impact of higher tariffs enacted during the president-elect's first term under his “America First” agenda. “If we look back historically when tariffs were enacted seven years ago, it did result in higher prices for customers,” Rainey said. Trump has promised to implement tariffs at levels unseen since the Great Depression, including 10%-20% tariffs across the board and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Such policies would push down US GDP by as much as 2.3% after two years, according to a report from the nonpartisan Tax Foundation. During Trump’s first presidency, his administration enacted tariffs on thousands of products equating to $80 billion worth of taxes on Americans, the Tax Foundation found. Following its earnings report on Tuesday, Walmart told Reuters in a statement: ""We're concerned that significantly increased tariffs could lead to increased costs for our customers at a time when they are still feeling the remnants of inflation."" Walmart spokesperson Molly Blakeman reiterated the sentiment in a conversation with Yahoo Finance Tuesday afternoon. Blakeman noted that while Walmart sources two-thirds of its products domestically and has been navigating higher tariffs for years, the levels to which Trump has proposed raising tariffs has caused ""concern."" Fellow retailer Lowe’s also noted that Trump's proposed tariffs would raise the costs of producing goods. “Roughly 40% of our cost of goods sold are sourced outside of the US, and that includes both direct imports and national brands through our vendor partners,” said CFO Brandon Sink in a call with investors on Tuesday. “And as we look at potential impact, certainly would add product costs, but timing and details remain uncertain at this point.” Both Lowe's and Walmart reported earnings on Tuesday morning. Trump has suggested using his proposed tariffs to fund government programs rather than income taxes. The president-elect has also said he believes his strategy would support domestic manufacturing, and his campaign has denied that import taxes would create short-term pains for consumers. On the other hand, the incoming president’s pick for commerce secretary, Cantor Fitzgerald chairman and CEO Howard Lutnick, has contended that the higher duties would result in higher prices. But he has also said he believes the tariffs would bolster purchases of domestically produced goods. Read more: How do tariffs work, and who really pays them? “I think tariffs make sense,” Lutnick told CNBC in a September interview. ""It will drive growth in America.” It remains to be seen whether Trump will deliver on his tariff promises. Citi analysts said in a note earlier this month that Trump's 60% tariff proposal on China is ""more likely to be a bargaining chip than a real risk."" In the meantime, retailers are bracing for a new reality.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-holidays-are-coming-and-experts-say-americans-will-be-opening-their-wallets-144804659.html,"Sun, Nov 17, 2024, 6:48 AM","A version of this story first appeared on TKer.co Americans plan to spend more on holiday shopping this year than they did last year. That’s the takeaway from pretty much every consumer survey conducted over the past several weeks. Below are some highlights (emphasis added): “Our proprietary survey of ~2,000 US consumers reveals a more positive outlook for holiday shopping versus 2023 and 2022. Overall, 37% of consumers are planning to keep their holiday budgets roughly the same, 35% expect to spend more, and 22% expect to spend less yielding a net of +13%.” - Morgan Stanley (11/13) “Consumer sentiment has also shown signs of improvement, and the 2024 Bank of America Holiday Survey suggests people are planning to spend $2,100 outside of typical obligations and necessities this holiday season, up 7% YoY.”- BofA (11/12) “According to The Conference Board Holiday Spending Survey, the average US consumer intends to spend $1,063 in nominal terms on holiday-related purchases in 2024, up 7.9% from $985 in 2023. This is also higher than in 2022 ($1,006) and 2021 ($1,022). On gifts, consumers plan to spend an average of $677, up 3.4% from $654 last year. After slumping last year, consumers’ budgets for non-gift items such as food, decorations, and wrapping paper are also up 17% at $387.” - The Conference Board (11/12) “Some 89% of consumers admitted they're tempted to spend more than they should during the holiday season, while 94% indicated they'd be tempted to make an unplanned purchase if the item were on sale. Over half (55%) of consumers said holiday deals have caused them to overspend; these big spenders said they are most likely to splurge on gifts for others.”- Experian (11/4) “Consumers are reaching a little deeper into their pockets this season, their average holiday budget rising 4% y-o-y to $613, according to Accenture's 18th Annual Holiday Shopping Survey.” - Accenture (10/30) “In a year when sustained consumer spending propelled growth and helped the economy skirt recession, we're calling for a fairly modest holiday sales season. We look for holiday sales to rise just 3.3% in November and December compared to last year, which is slower than last year and below the long-run average.” - Wells Fargo (10/28) “Gallup’s initial measure of Americans’ 2024 holiday spending intentions finds consumers planning to spend an average of $1,014 on Christmas or other holiday gifts. This is substantially more than their forecast of $923 at the same time last year, signaling that the 2024 holiday shopping season could be a bit kinder to U.S. retailers.” - Gallup (10/25) “Consumer spending on the winter holidays is expected to reach a record $902 per person on average across gifts, food, decorations and other seasonal items, according to the National Retail Federation’s latest consumer survey conducted by Prosper Insights & Analytics. The amount is about $25 per person more than last year’s figure and $16 higher than the previous record set in 2019.” - National Retail Federation (10/22) “U.S. consumers are set to spend 4% more on holiday shopping this year, with average spending projected to reach $948, compared to $911 in 2023, according to the KPMG 2024 Consumer Holiday Shopping Survey.” - KPMG (10/21) “After expressing record holiday spending intentions in 2023, respondents are yet again planning to up their purchases, and expect to spend $1,778 (+8% year over year) this holiday season. The uptick in spend is attributed to a rosier economic outlook (+9 percentage points [PP]), perceived higher prices (70%), and an increase in spend by the $100K to $199K income group (+17%).” - Deloitte (10/15) “Despite 59% of consumers saying that inflation will probably influence their holiday spending this year, overall spending is projected to increase by 7% to an average of $1,638 per shopper.” - PwC (10/1) We’ll have to wait to see if consumers come through and actually spend more this year. If they do, it would be consistent with the years-long narrative of record consumer spending. Just this past Friday, we learned retail sales in October rose to a record $718.9 billion. All this spending has been supported by healthy household balance sheets and real income growth. Sure, households aren’t as flush as they were earlier in the economic recovery — but they remain strong relative to history. This is best reflected by the debt-to-income ratio, which remains at historically low levels even as aggregate debt has been rising. “Although household balances continue to rise in nominal terms, growth in income has outpaced debt,” wrote Donghoon Lee, Economic Research Advisor at the New York Fed. It’s a reminder to take headlines like “US Household Debt Rises to $17.94 Trillion: N.Y. Fed"" and “Credit card debt hits record $1.17 trillion“ with caution because they lack the context you need to avoid drawing the wrong conclusions. Better headlines read like “Household debt is up, but Americans are in a better spot to pay it"" and “NY Fed says household debt up in third quarter as rising incomes ease debt burden."" And in case you’re wondering: Households have a long way to go before they max out their credit cards. Yes, debt delinquencies have been rising. It’s an economic warning sign to keep an eye on. But for now, they can be characterized as normalizing. “Aggregate delinquency rates edged up from the previous quarter, with 3.5% of outstanding debt in some stage of delinquency,“ New York Fed researchers noted. That’s significantly below Q4 2019 levels. Also, it’s notable that wage growth has outpaced inflation for 18 months. “This is how most Americans will ultimately be able to get ahead,” The Washington Post’s Heather Long wrote. “Prices won't go down, but wages will go up enough to offset the higher prices.” We’re also on a 46-month streak of net job creation in America. When more people have jobs, more people have money to spend. With a new political party moving into the White House next year, we can expected an upheaval in consumer sentiment. But as we’ve learned in recent years, people won’t put their lives on hold just because sentiment is poor. If they have money, they will spend it. There were a few notable data points and macroeconomic developments from last week to consider: Shopping rises to new record level. Retail sales increased 0.4% in October to a record $718.9 billion. Strength was broad with growth in electronics, cars and parts, restaurants and bars, building materials, and online shopping. Card spending data is holding up. From JPMorgan: “As of 08 Nov 2024, our Chase Consumer Card spending data (unadjusted) was 0.8% above the same day last year. Based on the Chase Consumer Card data through 08 Nov 2024, our estimate of the US Census November control measure of retail sales m/m is 0.35%.” Unemployment claims tick lower. Initial claims for unemployment benefits declined to 217,000 during the week ending November 9, down from 221,000 the week prior. This metric continues to be at levels historically associated with economic growth. Inflation remains cool. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in October was up 2.6% from a year ago, up from the 2.4% rate in September. This remains near February 2021 lows. Adjusted for food and energy prices, core CPI was up 3.3%, unchanged from the prior month’s level. On a month-over-month basis, CPI was up 0.2%. Core CPI increased by 0.3%. If you annualize the six-month trend in the monthly figures — a reflection of the short-term trend in prices — core CPI climbed 2.6%. Inflation expectations remain cool. From the New York Fed’s October Survey of Consumer Expectations: “Median inflation expectations fell at all three horizons in October. One-year-ahead inflation expectations declined by 0.1 percentage point to 2.9%, three-year-ahead inflation expectations declined by 0.2 percentage point to 2.5%, and five-year-ahead inflation expectations declined by 0.1 percentage point to 2.8%.” However, the introduction of tariffs as proposed by president-elect Donald Trump would be inflationary. For more, read: Wall Street agrees: Tariffs are bad Gas prices tick lower. From AAA: “The national average for a gallon of gas is now less than a dime away from dipping below $3 for the first time since May of 2021. But the possible formation of a new hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico could delay or even temporarily reverse the decline in pump prices. Since last week, the national average dropped two cents to $3.08.” Mortgage rates tick lower. According to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage declined to 6.78%, down from 6.79% last week. From Freddie Mac: “After a six-week climb, rates have leveled off, but overall affordability continues to be an issue for potential homebuyers. Freddie Mac’s latest research shows that mortgage payments compared to rents on the same homes are elevated relative to most of the last three decades.” There are 147 million housing units in the U.S., of which 86.6 million are owner-occupied and 34 million of which are mortgage-free. Of those carrying mortgage debt, almost all have fixed-rate mortgages, and most of those mortgages have rates that were locked in before rates surged from 2021 lows. All of this is to say: Most homeowners are not particularly sensitive to movements in home prices or mortgage rates. Importantly, the more tangible “hard” components of the index continue to hold up much better than the more sentiment-oriented “soft” components. Industrial activity ticks lower. Industrial production activity in October fell 0.3% from the prior month. Manufacturing output fell 0.5%. From the Federal Reserve: “A strike at a major producer of civilian aircraft held down total IP growth by an estimated 0.3 percentage point in September and 0.2 percentage point in October. Hurricane Milton and the lingering effects of Hurricane Helene together reduced October IP growth 0.1 percentage point.“ This is the stuff pros are worried about. According to BofA’s November Global Fund Manager Survey: “On tail risks… 32% of November FMS investors view higher inflation as the #1 biggest 'tail risk' (up from 26% in October). Concerns over geopolitical conflict took the 2nd place spot this month at 21% (down from 33% last month).” Offices remain relatively empty. From Kastle Systems: “Peak day office occupancy on Tuesday dropped more than five full points from the prior week to 57% as many workers went to the polls on Election Day. Occupancy also declined on Wednesday compared to the previous week, dropping 3.6 points to 57.8%. Washington, DC saw the largest decrease with its peak occupancy day dropping more than nine points to 50% on Thursday. The average low was on Friday at 32.6%, down six tenths of a point from last week.“ Near-term GDP growth estimates remain positive. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model sees real GDP growth climbing at a 2.5% rate in Q4. Putting it all together The long-term outlook for the stock market remains favorable, bolstered by expectations for years of earnings growth. And earnings are the most important driver of stock prices. Demand for goods and services is positive, and the economy continues to grow. At the same time, economic growth has normalized from much hotter levels earlier in the cycle. The economy is less “coiled” these days as major tailwinds like excess job openings have faded. To be clear: The economy remains very healthy, supported by strong consumer and business balance sheets. Job creation remains positive. And the Federal Reserve — having resolved the inflation crisis — has shifted its focus toward supporting the labor market. We are in an odd period given that the hard economic data has decoupled from the soft sentiment-oriented data. Consumer and business sentiment has been relatively poor, even as tangible consumer and business activity continue to grow and trend at record levels. From an investor’s perspective, what matters is that the hard economic data continues to hold up. Analysts expect the U.S. stock market could outperform the U.S. economy, thanks largely due to positive operating leverage. Since the pandemic, companies have adjusted their cost structures aggressively. This has come with strategic layoffs and investment in new equipment, including hardware powered by AI. These moves are resulting in positive operating leverage, which means a modest amount of sales growth — in the cooling economy — is translating to robust earnings growth. Of course, this does not mean we should get complacent. There will always be risks to worry about — such as U.S. political uncertainty, geopolitical turmoil, energy price volatility, cyber attacks, etc. There are also the dreaded unknowns. Any of these risks can flare up and spark short-term volatility in the markets. There’s also the harsh reality that economic recessions and bear markets are developments that all long-term investors should expect to experience as they build wealth in the markets. Always keep your stock market seat belts fastened. For now, there’s no reason to believe there’ll be a challenge that the economy and the markets won’t be able to overcome over time. The long game remains undefeated, and it’s a streak long-term investors can expect to continue.

Goal one was to ensure all the passionate Yahoo Finance fans in the audience came away more knowledgeable about investing than when they arrived. Considering the event was standing room only the entire day and notepads were out, I think mission accomplished here. The next goal was to cheer on the Yahoo Finance team of journalists interviewing titans of industry, as well as the incredible teams behind the scenes making the event come to life. I lost my voice a little the day after (which you could probably hear in the above Opening Bid podcast from the next day), so mission accomplished here too. And goal three —- wait for it — was to figure out why on earth movers and shakers in the world of business were so darn jazzed by another Trump presidency. Why were they hitting the buy button on stocks that were already near records pre-Election Day? Why were they more bullish on the business of doing business today compared to outgoing president Joe Biden? The president-elect has floated all sorts of potentially economically damaging policies, from stiff tariffs on China that run the risk of reigniting inflation to mass deportations that could severely upset supply chains. The market moves we've seen since Nov. 5 border on nonsensical, especially in the wake of the interesting cast of characters being put forward by Trump to run key government agencies. In the end, I got the answer to my question in two of my interviews: Apollo (APO) co-founder and CEO Marc Rowan (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management) and Bank of America (BAC) chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan. And the answer is this: The market has reasoned the billions of dollars the Biden administration pumped into the economy in areas such as infrastructure — which is only hitting now in a lot of cases — will be super-charged by looser regulations by Trump. This, in effect, could be coined the Trumpian-Biden rally. So the play appears to be buying possibly stronger-than-expected cash flows of companies today before the growth mushroom cloud appears down the line. A few important comments: Marc Rowan ""Look, this administration is coming in at a point in time where they really have an opportunity to pivot. Think about where the US is in the world. I mean, all the action is here. I mean, just recite what's going on. The economy is in great shape, certainly relative to the other two large blocs of Europe and China. We have stimulated our economy over the past four years, and we're about to get the dividend of that. I mean, we forget, three years ago, we passed almost $2 trillion for infrastructure. It's all under construction. Two years ago, $52 billion for semiconductor plants. Not a single plant is open yet, all under construction. Three years in a row, we've been the largest recipient of foreign direct investment, all under construction. It's coming our way. We're where the action is. And now the question is, can we lead? And you can pick almost any area, pick energy. We've spent all this time where the dialogue's been about energy transition. I think we're actually going to start talking about energy accretion. I mean, think of just the demand for data, for power, for data to help redefine our future. We can't just talk about transition anymore. We have to acknowledge we are going to need more power. No one produces clean power the way we produce it."" Brian Moynihan ""I think what's really driving the fundamental activity in the economy is the things that make America great. Capitalism. A consumer is employed and earning money and spending, and credit is widely available. Those are what drives this capital market, and investors like all the people here [at Invest] are putting [capital] to work. And that's what makes America great. And having a set of policies to enhance that is a good thing."" I guess what can go wrong? Let me tell you, a lot can go wrong. The path toward turbocharged growth over the next four years won't be straight — and could look ugly before it gets better. Appreciate the bull story, but continue to ask skeptical questions about it at every juncture. Thank you to everyone who spent the day with the Yahoo Finance team in person and live on our network. We felt your energy, and believe you me — we are already hard at work thinking through more innovative ways to present Invest in 2025.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inside-a-400-billion-bet-on-the-brain-computer-interface-revolution-150057794.html,"Mon, Nov 18, 2024, 7:00 AM","Computer chips are coming to a brain near you — and sooner than you think. At least that's according to a report by investment bank Morgan Stanley, which estimates the brain-computer interface (BCI) market could be the next opportunity for investors, with a total addressable market of $400 billion. ""This is, to us, the next big opportunity in med tech — and it's rare,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Kallum Titchmarsh told Yahoo Finance. ""BCIs have been in development for 100 years essentially. When you are five years away from full commercial launches, I think it's time to get excited and get ahead of the curve."" Titchmarsh covers medical technology stocks, such as Inari Medical (NARI), Penumbra (PEN), Sight Sciences (SGHT), Irhythm Technologies (IRTC), Nevro (NVRO), Inspire Medical Systems (INSP), and Embecta (EMBC), at Morgan Stanley. The report, published last month, estimates the commercial launch of BCIs in about five years. ""On our numbers, we expect just under $1.5 billion of revenue to be generated from BCI implant procedures out to 2035 (hitting north of a $500 million annual run rate in 2036), and hitting the $1 billion annual run rate by 2041,"" the report said. ""To us, these numbers seem very plausible, particularly when compared to existing med tech end markets..."" Analysts told Yahoo Finance that several neuro-technology companies are vying to be the Apple (AAPL) of their industry. Titchmarsh estimates the penetration will be limited in the first 20 years of launch — likely sitting at less than 3% by 2045. ""But still, this is such a large target market, you don't really need too much penetration to be generating quite significant revenues,"" he said. Morgan Stanley broke the market into two categories: enabling BCIs and preventative BCIs. Enabling BCIs would help patients who have already lost their ability to move or speak as a result of a severe neurological disease or traumatic injury. Preventative BCIs would stop conditions such as depression and epilepsy. Initial applications will help those with motor neuron disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (40,000 and 30,000 people), spinal cord injury (300,000), stroke (900,000), multiple sclerosis (1 million), cerebral palsy (500,000), limb amputation (2.5 million), epilepsy (3 million), and depression (21 million, 2.5 million with severe treatment-resistant). ""In the future, there will be no phones, just Neuralinks,"" Elon Musk posted on X, formerly Twitter, in June. Musk co-founded BCI company Neuralink in 2016, which is now valued at a reported $8 billion. There are several others making big strides that are backed by the richest people in the world. Synchron, a company that implants its chip through the blood vessels with no drilling of the skull, has its Series C funding round backed by Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates and Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos. The company has an estimated valuation of about $400 million. Palantir (PLTR) co-founder and venture capitalist Peter Thiel has poured at least $10 million into Blackrock Neurotech, which sports a valuation of a reported $350 million. German billionaire Christian Angermayer is on the board of Blackrock Neurotech and is also an investor. Titchmarsh is focusing on four players he says currently lead the pack: Neuralink, Synchron, Precision Neuroscience, and Paradromics. ""I think being first is super important,"" Titchmarsh said, adding that whichever company is first to market will get the foothold on reimbursement. ""It's rare to see four or five players in a med tech space compete. It is more likely we'll see probably three."" He expects that within the first few years of a commercial launch, the market will be narrowed down to three key players. Beyond that the likelihood of acquisitions by public companies is high. ""Three large companies have neuromodulation businesses: Medtronic, Abbott, and Boston Scientific,"" Titchmarsh said. ""But this seems very unique of a market, and it may actually be better in the hands of these companies as kind of pure plays for now so that it doesn't get lost in the broader development pipeline. Would I be surprised in 10 years if one of these large med tech companies had a BCI? Not at all."" Last month, Precision Neuroscience closed a $93 million funding round, valuing the startup at around $500 million. ""We view brain-computer interfaces as a generationally important life sciences innovation and one that really is ... going to have applicability today in paralysis, tomorrow in a number of different areas,"" Michael Mager, co-founder and CEO of Precision Neuroscience, told me at Yahoo Finance's Invest conference (video above). ""We tried to build this company from the very beginning to go the distance."" Catch more in-depth conversations from Yahoo Finance's Invest conference Precision has temporarily implanted its device, called the Layer 7 Cortical Interface, into more than two dozen patients during clinical trials. The company uses a minimally invasive approach that doesn't penetrate the brain like its competitors. Precision Neuroscience's co-founder and chief science officer, Benjamin Rapoport (formerly of Neuralink), said the technology goes beyond med tech. ""There's an aspect of it that is novel manufacturing techniques,"" Rapoport, a practicing neurosurgeon, told Yahoo Finance. ""There's an aspect of it that is supply chain related. There's a significant aspect of it that's artificial intelligence and machine learning-driven. We're pushing so many limits on all these fronts that there's not really any other, to date, field or technology in medicine that has required innovation on so many levels at the same time."" Precision is awaiting FDA approval to implant its chip in patients for up to 30 days. Rapoport expects the cost of a BCI to be six figures. ""For the economic impact on a young person, who has probably 50 years of life and maybe 35 years of work ahead of them, what you're giving them and their family is a level of independence and economic self-sufficiency,"" Rapoport said.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-isnt-panicking-with-known-entity-jay-clayton-as-new-top-cop-130918574.html,"Tue, Nov 19, 2024, 5:09 AM","President-elect Donald Trump’s choice of former SEC boss Jay Clayton to lead an office of prosecutors with a history of pursuing financial crimes is notable for its complete lack of controversy — especially on Wall Street. The announcement that Clayton would serve as US Attorney for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) came amid a string of other Trump nominations that attracted considerably more attention for their breaking of norms, including Matt Gaetz as attorney general and Pete Hegseth as defense department secretary. Clayton, on the other hand, is a ""well-respected, known entity,"" said white-collar criminal defense attorney and former federal prosecutor Michael Weinstein. After he ran the Securities and Exchange Commission from 2017 to 2020, Clayton returned to the New York white-shoe law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, where he currently advises on financial regulations and government investigations. He also serves on the board of the giant private equity firm Apollo Global Management. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management). Clayton was ""considered somewhat pro-Wall Street"" during his time at the SEC and ""had a good reputation coming out of that role,"" said former federal prosecutor William Devaney, chair of Baker McKenzie's North American litigation and government enforcement group. Trump ""didn’t put in his own political guy, at least,"" added Weinstein, who noted that Clayton’s experience at the SEC and as a litigation attorney should help streamline the financial cases that make up the bread and butter of SDNY’s work. Not that Clayton doesn’t have some work to do if he gets confirmed by the US Senate to the post. He lacks criminal prosecution experience, which, to Weinstein, creates ""a real blind spot"" for the jurisdiction that will need to be overcome with help from experienced deputies. And he is also not free from all political controversy surrounding moves made by Trump in the past. He landed in the spotlight during Trump’s first term in office in the summer of 2020 when he was first floated for the SDNY post during a White House shake-up. In June of that year, Trump’s US Attorney General Bill Barr wrote in a letter to Trump-appointed SDNY chief Geoffrey Berman that he wanted Berman to resign so that he could be replaced by Clayton. Berman refused, and Trump made a controversial move, firing him. At the time, Berman had already prosecuted defendants with ties to Trump, including associates of Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani, Lev Parnas, and Igor Fruman, who were convicted on campaign finance contribution violations. Clayton told lawmakers in public testimony that summer that he was ""fully committed"" to his work at the SEC and ultimately didn’t take the position. His political skills could be tested again if confirmed for the SDNY post. Trump, who was convicted of 34 felonies this year in a New York State Supreme Court case, has vowed retribution on those who prosecuted him. The case was prosecuted by Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg. “The question will be how much autonomy he or any US Attorney will have in the Trump Justice Department,” said Baker McKenzie's Devaney. Clayton would join an office that has for decades pursued cases involving Wall Street wrongdoing, organized crime, drug rings, political corruption, and terrorism. Its most high-profile cases in recent years include the prosecution of FTX cryptocurrency exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried, US Senator Bob Menendez, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, and hip-hop mogul Sean ""Diddy"" Combs. During his time as SEC chair, Clayton initiated more than 2,800 enforcement actions and assessed $15 billion in financial remedies. The SEC returned $3.5 billion to harmed investors and paid more than $580 million in whistleblower rewards. Just before leaving the SEC in December 2020, Clayton launched a first-of-its-kind lawsuit against enterprise software company Ripple, the company that created the digital currency XRP (XRP-USD). In the case, the SEC alleged that the cryptocurrency had been illegally sold as an unregistered security. The commission later dropped the charges in favor of pursuing a remedy to address the SEC’s concerns. Before Clayton left the SEC he also tangled with Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, an adviser to Trump on the campaign trail who this month was tapped to curtail government spending in the new administration. Musk and the SEC in 2018 agreed to a deal to resolve securities fraud charges against the billionaire after Musk posted to social media platform X that he had ""funding secured"" for a buyout of the electric-car company at $420 a share. Musk stepped aside as chairman for three years and agreed to a $20 million fine. Trump, in his announcement on Truth Social, called Clayton ""a highly respected business leader, counsel and public servant.""

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-jumps-on-report-trump-could-ease-self-driving-regulations-183853598.html,"Mon, Nov 18, 2024, 1:01 PM","Tesla (TSLA) stock jumped on Monday as more news rolls in indicating that CEO Elon Musk’s bet on President-elect Donald Trump is paying off. Bloomberg News reported Trump’s transition team has told advisers it plans to make a “federal framework” for full self-driving (FSD) or autonomous vehicles one of the Transportation Department’s priorities, according to people familiar with the matter. Easing rules for the introduction of self-driving vehicles, especially those without pedals or steering wheels, would be a huge boon for Tesla. Musk has repeatedly said that the future of the company hinges on FSD and autonomous technologies. Tesla stock closed up 5.6% on Monday, and is up over 40% since Election Day (Nov. 5). Current federal rules by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) have eased somewhat recently in regard to autonomous vehicles. However, the rules still dictate that an occupant must be able to operate a ""steering control"" mechanism to manually control the vehicle if need be. While the NHTSA does allow companies to petition for allowances or changes for testing purposes, those are hard to come by. GM’s Cruise recently abandoned its Origin autonomous vehicle that uses a steering wheel and pedals due to regulatory uncertainty; Cruise is using Chevrolet Bolt EVs with manual controls in its autonomous drives. Though the NHTSA and the Department of Transportation can issue rules and regulations to ease driverless driving requirements like physical controls, Bloomberg reported that Congress could step in with “a bipartisan legislative measure being discussed in early stages” that would create federal rules around EVs, per two separate sources. An act of Congress could preempt current rules by the NHTSA and the DOT and could also be used by state and local governments to develop their own self-driving regulations. Congress and the federal government could also force local governments to use federal rules by threatening to pull highway and infrastructure spending if they aren’t followed. New federal rules easing autonomous driving and requirements would be a huge win for Tesla and Musk. Last month, at a glitzy event at the Warner Bros.. studio lot, Musk showcased Tesla’s upcoming Cybercab robotaxi and autonomous van concept, vehicles that do not include physical driver controls like a steering wheel or pedals. Musk said the company has already begun testing its Cybercab, with a potential debut coming in 2026. “Musk's significant influence in the Trump White House is already having a major influence and ultimately the golden path for Tesla around Cybercabs and autonomous is now within reach with an emboldened Trump/Musk strategic alliance playing out in real time and very in line with our thesis,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to investors Monday morning. Ives and Wedbush predict Tesla’s AI and autonomous business could be worth $1 trillion alone, and the expectation is for a Trump White House to fast-track FSD and robotaxi initiatives, meaning the “federal regulatory spiderweb” Tesla encountered over the past few years could be cleared.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ibm-ceo-on-trump-less-regulation-more-innovation-is-a-win-for-business-163041839.html,"Sun, Nov 17, 2024, 9:33 AM","Tech executives may be warming to Donald Trump’s return to the White House as his quick win sparks optimism for more spending and dealmaking. “Business does a lot better when uncertainty goes away,” IBM (IBM) CEO Arvind Krishna told me at Yahoo Finance’s Invest conference. “We are hopeful that there is going to be a lot more innovation and less regulation. Those are both good for businesses across the board.” Krishna believes a lighter regulatory environment will prompt clients to make investment decisions more quickly and also lay the groundwork for a more favorable deal environment. “If we have more certainty on the outcome, then we are willing to lean into things like M&A … If the regulatory process and antitrust are going to be more certain, that allows you to take more risk,” Krishna added. A shift toward less regulation would be a dramatic change for the industry, which has faced intense scrutiny from the Biden administration. Under FTC Chair Lina Khan’s leadership, regulators aggressively pursued cases against the industry’s biggest companies, including Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL). Trump, on the other hand, has promised to cut excess red tape, including his promise to throw out Biden’s executive order aimed at putting safety guardrails on AI — a move that would be viewed as controversial by those within the industry. While Trump’s antitrust agendas remain uncertain, there seems to be growing optimism that he'll employ a more hands-off approach compared to Biden. “We expect tech stocks to rally further into year-end as the Street further digests a less regulatory spider web under Trump with Khan/FTC days in the rear view mirror, stronger AI initiatives within the Beltway on the way, and a goldilocks foundation for Big Tech and Tesla looking into 2025 and beyond,” Wedbush’s Dan Ives wrote in a recent note to clients. Cisco (CSCO) CFO Scott Herren is confident in the company’s momentum heading into 2025. He told me on Yahoo Finance’s Catalysts that he feels “really good” about Cisco’s position, noting “strength across the board.” “It's hard to predict what's going to happen from a political standpoint, but when you look at the things that are going to drive government efficiency, we've got the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) that's about increasing productivity, and technology is always going to be critical to increasing productivity,” Herren said. Despite optimism from tech leaders, investor sentiment seems a bit more cautious. Performance of the Magnificent Seven stocks, outside of Tesla (TSLA), has been lackluster since Election Day, hampered by risks associated with a stronger dollar and more tariffs. That could change quickly, Defiance ETFs CEO Sylvia Jablonski told me. AI, which has “essentially been all the rage” on Wall Street, remains in its “infancy,” with vast growth potential ahead, he said. And IBM’s Krishna echoed this sentiment, citing AI as a key catalyst not only for IBM’s stock but the US tech sector overall. “AI spending from our clients is going to increase ... And automation spending is going to go up … I think that there is going to be more of an appetite for US technology globally,” Krishna said. “There’s going to be a lot more appetite to go invest in US technology from all over the globe.” Since the start of the year, IBM shares have climbed more than 25%, outpacing the Nasdaq 100's (^NDX) 20% jump.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-could-be-the-next-biden-210950477.html,"Tue, Nov 19, 2024, 1:09 PM","Democrats are deservedly disheartened at the drubbing voters administered in the 2024 elections. Americans didn’t just restore Donald Trump to the White House, they also gave Republicans control of both houses of Congress and exiled the Democratic Party to the political wilderness. Trumpism rules, it seems. But there could be another trend at work that will boomerang back on to Trump, eventually: Americans may be chronically gloomy about stagnating living standards and bound to take it out on whoever is in charge. For three elections in a row, voters have bounced the incumbent party from the White House. Trump upset Hillary Clinton in 2016 in what was partly a vote against the slow-growing Barack Obama economy. Joe Biden beat Trump in 2020 amid widespread dissatisfaction with Trump’s handling of the COVID pandemic. The 2024 election was a referendum on the policies of Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who replaced Biden atop the Democratic ticket in August. The outcome: thumbs down, especially on economic issues. The incumbent party normally has a decisive advantage in presidential elections, whether the president is running for another term or passing the torch to a successor. Unless there's a recession, the incumbent party typically wins. Yet there was no recession in 2016, when voters replaced the incumbent Democrat with a Republican. There was a short recession in 2020, but it ended seven months before Election Day, when voters ejected Trump. And despite high inflation, there’s been no recession under Biden. The power of incumbency simply isn’t what it used to be. Inflation was clearly ruinous for Biden and Harris, but so was their inability to fix intractable problems that go back decades. In a recent Harvard CAPS/Harris poll, the economy ranked as the top issue for 2024 voters and 58% rated the economy as “weak.” Of people who cast a ballot, 76% said they voted for change. Trump was the change candidate because he’s been on the sidelines for the past four years — and there were no other choices. So will Trump bring the change Americans want? On some issues — notably immigration — he could, because the president has the authority to set policy in a way that will make a difference. But there’s a good chance many of the problems vexing voters in 2024 will be just as nettlesome in 2028, when Trump will be the incumbent promoting his own vice president, JD Vance, as the future of Trumpism. Drop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter. America has become a wrong-track country. For the last 20 years, more than half of all Americans have been unhappy with the direction of the country, according to Gallup. There was an uptick in satisfaction under Trump, but that crashed amid COVID. The broader trend is stark: Not once during the last 20 years has satisfaction approached the peaks of the 1990s, when Bill Clinton was president, or the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan served two terms. The most likely explanation for this national gloom is worsening wealth and income inequality, with well-educated workers in dynamic areas getting ahead and undereducated workers in stagnant parts of the country falling behind. Wealth for college graduates has grown by 356% since 2000, according to Federal Reserve data. Wealth for Americans with just a high school degree has grown by just 100% during the same time frame. The portion of wealth held by college grads has grown from 60% to 74% since 2000. For high-school grads, it has dropped from 17% to 9%. There’s nothing wrong with well-educated people in the right places getting wealthier. But there’s a lot wrong with lesser-educated people who make up the majority of the US population getting poorer. Trump appeals to that demographic when he rails against companies shipping jobs overseas and migrants working for less pay than Americans might. In the 2024 election, 43% of voters had a college degree, while 57% did not. Less-educated Americans are decisive in national elections. They’re the ones demanding change, in the form of paychecks that stretch further and improving living standards. But there’s no simple cure for a tech-based service economy that has left millions of workers behind. Trump’s plan to slap new tariffs on imports and deport millions of undocumented migrants won’t do anything to restore the sort of high-paying manufacturing jobs millions of Americans relied on 50 years ago. Automation, artificial intelligence, and agile supply chains provide the efficiency big companies crave. They don’t want to hire more Americans to do manual labor for higher pay, and Trump can’t browbeat them into doing so. Some cities and states have programs to match employers with local schools that train the types of workers they need, which helps young people develop the skills that will help them get ahead. Trump hasn’t proposed anything like that. Instead, he falls back on lazy, supply-side orthodoxy: Cut taxes and regulations and turn businesses loose to grow and prosper. Developments of the last 40 years show that this enriches the shareholder class, with little trickling down to workers. If anything, Trump could put upward pressure on prices, just as inflation seems to be abating, by deporting migrants who work on farms and at processing plants and making imported products more expensive through higher tariffs. Trump hasn’t proposed anything to lower housing costs, and interest rates are already drifting upward in anticipation of slightly higher inflation and a lot more deficit spending under Trump. If that happens, rent and groceries could take a bigger bite out of the typical paycheck four years from now. Biden’s record as president holds cautionary notes for Trump and other future presidents. Biden actually got measurable results that ought to boost blue-collar fortunes. He signed laws funding infrastructure buildout, semiconductor manufacturing, and green energy investment, which will subsidize employment in those fields years into the future. Some provisions of those laws require employers getting subsidies to hire unionized workers. The economy, meanwhile, has added 685,000 manufacturing jobs since Biden took office, twice the number under Trump before COVID hit and unemployment soared. None of that impressed voters in 2024, and Trump could have just as much difficulty moving the needle during the next four years. And in 2028, the Trumpist candidate will be the incumbent trying to sell voters on more of the same. Rick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance. Follow him on Twitter at @rickjnewman.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-the-trump-tariffs-on-taiwan-chips-could-hurt-the-ai-trade--and-the-likes-of-nvidia-153010013.html,"Sun, Nov 17, 2024, 7:30 AM","President-elect Donald Trump made raising tariffs on imported goods a tenet of his reelection campaign. And while that could raise prices on everything from jeans to children’s toys for everyday Americans, Trump has also floated the idea of another tariff that could impact Wall Street’s current favorite trade: AI. During an appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast ahead of the election, Trump lambasted the idea of the CHIPS Act, a bipartisan piece of legislation Biden signed in 2022 designed to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US. He called it “so bad.” Instead of using legislation and billions in subsidies to bring chip-building facilities to the US, Trump said tariffs would have the same effect. In Trump’s estimation, putting tariffs on semiconductors from Taiwan would force chip builders, like TSMC, to construct chip manufacturing plants, or fabs, in the US to avoid having to pay the added tax. But there’s no guarantee chip builders wouldn’t simply move the added cost down the line to their customers and forego spending cash on expensive US facilities. Such a move could also end up cutting into profit margins for companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD), which rely on chips built in Taiwan, unless they similarly pass those costs down to their own customers. And that could have ripple effects across the tech industry. “If the argument is that this is the way to force it to move here, TSMC is already moving here,” explained William Reinsch, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “They're already building a fab plant in Arizona. That's all already underway and the tariffs aren't going to make that move any faster. If anything, they might complicate the effort.” Trump has continuously pushed the idea of tariffs as a means of targeting the US trade deficit and bringing manufacturing jobs back to America. He’s already said he wants to see a 10% to 20% tax on all imported products and a 60% tax on Chinese goods. During his interview with Rogan, Trump said that instead of moving forward with the CHIPS Act, he would have put tariffs on chips coming out of Taiwan, though he didn’t say how much. The US has made reshoring chip manufacturing a major national security objective after the pandemic exposed the fragility of the global chip supply chain—and America’s reliance on other countries for advanced semiconductors. According to a 2023 US International Trade Commission working paper, 44% of US imports of logic chips — central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), etc. — came from Taiwan as of 2021. In the event of a “major manufacturing disruption,” the working paper estimated that the price of logic chips would jump as much as 59%, and US capacity would only be able to fill a portion of the gap left by the lack of Taiwanese imports. The CHIPS Act is supposed to increase chip manufacturing in the US and some companies are already moving to construct new facilities in the country with the promise of funding coming down the pike. Experts, meanwhile, are torn on whether the president-elect will move forward on such an import tax. Futurum Group CEO Dan Newman said that Trump’s threats were likely nothing more than political posturing for election season rather than a flat-out promise that he would definitely move ahead with tariffs. “Trump is unlikely to move forward with anything that hurts the economy because that’s what he wants to be known for,” Newman told Yahoo Finance. But others, like Columbia Business School associate professor Lori Yue, say there’s a high probability that Trump will move forward with chip tariffs. If Trump does hit Taiwan-built chips with tariffs, Yue said, it will mean higher prices for Nvidia and other chip companies that get their chips from the country. But, she added, the increase in chip sales that could come as a result of deregulation related to AI under a second Trump administration might help offset those price increases. Newman, for his part, said that tariffs on chips out of Taiwan could eventually force chip designers to lean on Intel’s (INTC) facilities in the US at a time when that company is seeking third-party chip customers. For now, the chip industry, and those companies that rely on it, will have to wait and see what Trump decides to do when he takes office in January. Until then, anything is on the table.

Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up by about the same measure. Once the pillar of this two-year bull market, semiconductors have been a net drag on US stocks over the last four months. Nvidia (NVDA) earnings — coming after the bell Wednesday — will provide a reality check on just how important the AI poster child (and its cousins) are to this rally. Tom Essaye, founder and president of the Sevens Report, recently joined Yahoo Finance and broke down the key elements traders are looking for in Nvidia earnings Wednesday. ""It's all about the guidance. How enthusiastic and how aggressive [Nvidia is] on the guidance,"" said Essaye. ""It's a growth story here. We all know it. It's the future. It's the next big thing. They've got to keep us excited about it via this earnings print."" Nvidia has roared back strong since its July slump, rising 45% from the major August low. The chip stock — up nearly 200% this year and up over 1100% in the last two years — hit record highs following the election. But many of Nvidia's peers, especially smaller ones, have become a net drag on the industry and US stocks writ large since the start of the second half of the year. The worst-off among this group of chip stocks, Super Micro Computer (SMCI), faces idiosyncratic problems as it struggles to avoid delisting on the Nasdaq exchange. Qorvo (QRVO) is down over 40%, as is Mobileye Global (MBLY) in the second half of the year so far. Meanwhile, Intel (INTC), Micron (MU), KLA Corp (KLAC), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Microchip (MCHP) are all down more than 20%. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) — seen as Nvidia's biggest competitor — is down 14%. The PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX), which tracks chip industry stocks, has fluctuated for several months. And a fresh two-month low on Monday this week made some technical traders nervous. To be fair, the US rally has already broadened in the third and fourth quarters far beyond the influence of chip stocks, and that's likely to continue next year, as Josh Schafer wrote Monday. ""Nvidia is not the full market driver that it was, say, earlier [in the rally],"" said Essaye. Since the second quarter, Tech (XLK) has been the second-worst-performing sector after Healthcare (XLV), barely in positive territory. Accordingly, investors might wonder if this bull market can continue if tech suddenly becomes an anchor on the S&P 500. And should Nvidia — ""priced to perfection"" according to many analysts — underdeliver and underwhelm, investors may face that reckoning. But Essaye is willing to overlook some of the recent weakness in this ""bellwether"" stock, citing pre-earnings jitters. It's hard not to be optimistic, based on the momentum of the past two years.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/owning-a-home-has-rarely-been-this-much-more-expensive-than-renting-155251484.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 10:01 AM","On paper, owning a home is almost always more expensive than renting — about 14% more, on average, after factoring in expenses like insurance, taxes, and upkeep. But the difference has grown much more extreme in recent years as just about all homeownership costs have ballooned. How extreme? Exact cost estimates vary, but recently the premium for homeownership has been at least 35% over renting, a level that’s near historical highs and is likely to persist. “We’re well, well beyond what the typical historical difference is if you were to buy an entry-level home versus rent a starter home,” said Rick Palacios Jr., director of research at John Burns Research and Consulting. “I think that’s a big part of why you see the resale market in a recession.” Palacios’s firm has found factors like rising homeowners insurance premiums explain much of the growing gap. Higher mortgage rates don’t help either. Leaving other factors constant, it would take mortgage rates to be at 3.5% for the buying versus renting math to return to historical averages. Commercial real estate investment firm CBRE pegs the premium to buy versus own at about 35% earlier this year, with the dip in mortgage rates in the fall helping bring that level down from a record high of 52%. Their measure includes the cost of mortgage insurance that most lenders require but doesn’t factor in expenses like homeowners insurance or upkeep. “If anything, what we present … is a very conservative approach, said Travis Deese, associate director for multifamily research at CBRE. “It likely is a lot higher than that.” The differential might get a bit less extreme next year if mortgage rates slowly drop and rents creep up, CBRE found. But stubbornly high home prices will prevent the premium from moving too much. The company expects the premium to end 2025 at around 25%. Read more: Mortgage rates are still increasing — is this a good time to buy a house? Buying versus renting is a fierce debate in personal finance circles, and both factions come armed with talking points. Buyers point to how they’re building equity and shielding themselves from the looming threat of rent increases. Renters tout their maintenance-free lifestyles and the ease of moving if they want to try living somewhere new. The choice is ultimately personal, and buying remains the long-term goal for the majority of Americans. But while home ownership costs have continued to move higher, renters have recently gotten a little bit of a break. Like home prices, rents are still markedly higher than pre-pandemic levels, but aggressive apartment construction has helped minimize further increases this year. Nationwide, median rents rose just 0.2% in October from a year earlier, according to Redfin, although areas with less construction, like the Northeast and Midwest, saw larger jumps. Brooke Merino, 26, knows the calculus. She works in sales, helping renters in the Denver area find apartments, and has recently seen some buildings offer discounted lease renewals. Her own rental, a two-bedroom home, costs her just over $2,500 a month for rent and utilities. And she recently closed on a $525,000, four-bedroom, two-bathroom house in Englewood, Colo. Her mortgage payment will be about $3,500. “I don’t mind renting, but I’m at the point where I want to buy and move forward,” Merino said. “It was just a matter of determining what I was comfortable with, and what I knew I could afford.” In all, Merino feels she got a deal: The home she bought had lingered on the market and saw several price reductions, and she locked in a sub-6% mortgage rate just before rates began rising again this fall. She’s looking forward to having more space and a large yard for her dog. Many prospective homeowners haven’t been so lucky. Average mortgage rates of around 7% are a bit lower than they were this time a year ago, but median home prices have been stubbornly stuck close to all-time highs. “The one-year outlook is for very little change in home prices, rents, and mortgage rates,” said Matt Vance, Americas head of multifamily research at CBRE. Fannie Mae, which surveys consumers monthly on their feelings about the housing market, found in October that a record high 36% of consumers say their next move will be to rent rather than buy. The rental preference has been growing slowly in recent years. Three years ago, 26% said they would be likely to rent. Savannah West, 28, opted to become a renter again after renovating a three-bedroom, two-bathroom fixer-upper she and her partner bought in Douglasville, Ga., in 2021 proved daunting. “It felt like a really sweet deal, but we were spending thousands of dollars almost every month on home improvement supplies,” West said. “We lived at Home Depot.” West, an editor at lifestyle website Home & Texture, was also growing tired of making the 30- to 40-minute drive from the suburbs to Atlanta for events. So over the summer, her family moved into a loft in the city, renting out their suburban home to cover their mortgage payment. She likes being able to walk to nearby restaurants and bars and takes her daughter to the city’s many activities. While renting suits her for now, she’s considering purchasing a condo in Atlanta in the future. Real estate agent Iain Phillips is generally a fan of buying, perhaps an unsurprising stance for someone in the business of selling homes. But he understands when his clients opt to continue renting, especially in expensive Orange County, Calif., where he works. Several first-time homebuyers he’s working with will likely have payments of $4,000 or $4,500 a month to buy instead of $3,000 to rent. He advises potential buyers to get comfortable with the size of their monthly payment before committing to a purchase and plan on staying in their homes for at least five years. “You don’t want to be house-poor in this economy,” Phillips said.

On Monday night, Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin initiated a 2025 year-end S&P 500 target of 6,500, representing about an 11% gain in the benchmark index from current levels. The call falls in line with the 6,500 projection Morgan Stanley made the day prior and just shy of BMO Capital Markets' 2025 year-end target of 6,700. ""In our baseline macro outlook, the economy and earnings continue to grow and bond yields remain around current levels,"" Kostin wrote. ""But event risk remains high heading into 2025, including from the potential threat of an across-the-board tariff and the potential risk from even higher bond yields."" Kostin and others say the market could surge higher even without the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks' massive outperformance. His work shows that the combination of Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) outperformed the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500 by 63 percentage points in 2023 and 22 percentage points thus far this year. In 2024, this was driven by Magnificent Seven earnings outperforming the rest of the index by 30 percentage points. But that margin is projected to fall to just 6 percentage points in 2025, per consensus estimates. This, Kostin believes, will lead to that cohort beating the other 493 stocks by just 7 percentage points in 2025, the narrowest level of outperformance from the Magnificent Seven dating back to 2018. ""The narrowing differential in earnings growth rates should correspond with a narrowing in relative equity returns,"" Kostin wrote. ""Although the 'micro' earnings growth story supports continued ‘Magnificent 7’ outperformance, more 'macro' factors such as economic growth and trade policy lean in favor of the S&P 493.""' Within this call for a broadening of stock market performance within the S&P 500, Goldman also argues that the stocks leading the artificial intelligence trade may begin to shift. Goldman believes gains will shift from a group it has dubbed AI ""infrastructure,"" which includes companies on the ground floor of AI like Nvidia (NVDA), to a group of companies that will have ""enabled revenues"" from AI, meaning those that can use AI to drive sales but aren't actually selling things like AI chips to other companies. The largest companies by market cap in Goldman's enabled revenues basket are Meta and Apple. In the outlook named after Donald Trump's ""Art of the Deal,"" Kostin recommends owning stocks that could be exposed to a pickup in M&A under the president-elect's administration as well as companies who benefit from a pickup in activity among small and medium-size businesses. Kostin cited a pickup in the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) small business optimism index back in November 2016 when Trump was first elected. Goldman identified a list of 60 companies with at least 50% of revenues tied to small businesses. Large companies in that cohort include Meta, Deere & Company (DE), and Waste Management (WM). ""It was truly a reflection of 'animal spirits' coming to life and this behavior is likely to be repeated now that Donald Trump has been elected to serve as the 47th President from January 2025 to January 2029,"" Kostin wrote. ""The valuation of [small business]-exposed stocks reflects the current depressed level of small business sentiment. We expect an improving small business operating environment will boost the sentiment and spending of [small businesses] in 2025 and lift the earnings and valuation of stocks with revenues tied to that spending.""

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-is-optimistic-about-trump-20-140024772.html,"Mon, Nov 18, 2024, 6:00 AM","The vibe on Wall Street post-Donald Trump's reelection: Bring on the good times. “This election was about whether you were more scared of four years of the same or more scared of four years of change,” Apollo Global (APO) co-founder and CEO Marc Rowan said at Yahoo Finance's Invest conference. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.) Rowan, who is now being floated as a potential Treasury Secretary pick in the incoming Trump administration, added that the ""market's verdict's been rendered.” “I think this administration has a remarkable chance to really pivot the country to take advantage of all the inherent positives that we have,” Rowan said. Rowan’s optimism matches that of the market, with the S&P 500 rallying above 6,000 in the best post-election day melt-up of all time. Experts say the rally is based in part on Trump's policy proposals around making tax cuts permanent and loosening regulations. But that rally and optimism may be ignoring a tariffs-led headwind. The top 100 firms in the S&P 500 by market cap get 8% of their revenue on average from China. If Trump’s proposed 60% tariff on Chinese imports comes to fruition, profit margins and stock prices could slip, though it’s more likely tariffs will double from current levels, according to Bloomberg Economics. Read more: How do tariffs work, and who really pays them? It's a concern Deutsche Bank chief US economist Matthew Luzzetti echoed on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast. “Markets are telling you more or less Donald Trump means somewhat good for growth, somewhat inflationary,” Bridgewater Associates co-chief investment officer Karen Karniol-Tambour said at Invest, warning that immigration restrictions and a lift to the deficit are inflationary. To understand when the deficit devil over the shoulder becomes a zombie in front of you, BlackRock’s Rick Rieder watches foreign demand at Treasury auctions. Despite these risks and elevated equity multiples, he’s still bullish. ""The technicals for equities are crazy, … crazy good,"" Rieder said at Invest. ""I've learned over my career the technicals win. ... Even if you believe in the fundamentals, the technicals win more."" An easing cycle from the Federal Reserve that the market believes could bring the US to a soft landing also doesn’t hurt. Though Judy Shelton, a former economic adviser and Trump appointee to the Fed, didn’t want to throw the Fed a victory party anytime soon. “We’ve gone through the worst inflation in 40 years, and when it comes to accountability … I don’t think that anyone got fired at the Fed,” Shelton said at the conference. Shelton also called into question the Fed’s role moving forward. “I think this is an interesting time when people are looking at the appropriate role of the Federal Reserve … and maybe rethinking whether we want … [the interest rate and the price of capital] to be set by a dozen people voting eight times a year,” Shelton said, adding she is also optimistic on the next Trump presidency. Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan sees potential policies under Trump as being economically favorable. ""I think what's really driving the fundamental activity in the economy is the things that make America great,"" Moynihan explained. ""Capitalism. A consumer is employed and earning money and spending, and credit is widely available. Those are what drives this capital market, and investors like all the people here [at Invest] are putting [capital] to work. And that's what makes America great. And having a set of policies to enhance that is a good thing."" My interview with billionaire climate investor and former 2020 presidential candidate Tom Steyer also left investors on both sides of the aisle with something to be hopeful about. ""To a very large extent, it doesn't matter” who is in the White House, Steyer argued about the clean energy transition. As he sees it, free market dynamics will allow for cheaper, faster, better products to win. As Trump continues to announce Cabinet positions and the market reacts to how personnel choices will inform policy, perhaps investors would be wise to remember that regardless of who is in the White House, stocks tend to go up over time.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-tom-steyer-trump-presidency-wont-hold-back-the-energy-transition-173029593.html,"Sun, Nov 17, 2024, 9:50 AM","Billionaire Tom Steyer cares about politics. He ran for president in 2020 on a climate-friendly agenda, which was followed by his opponents in the Democratic primary solidifying their climate proposals. Since then, he’s founded Galvanize Climate Solutions, an investment firm focused on climate impact, which former Secretary of State John Kerry recently joined as co-executive chair. Given that context, you’d think Steyer would be nervous about the next four years with the election of Donald Trump, who is likely to exit the Paris Climate Agreement again. But in an interview at Yahoo Finance's Invest conference, Steyer stated, “To a very large extent, it doesn't matter” who is in the White House. As he sees it, climate solutions will win in the free market. Steyer pointed to the energy transition that’s already taking place in “deep red states” across the country. Texas, for instance, is the biggest wind energy producer in the United States despite state legislation that excludes wind projects from tax breaks and favors fossil fuels. ""Why are they doing that? Because of the money,"" Steyer said. ""This is business. This is economics. Nobody gets to get away from the rules of markets and prices."" Steyer's comments mirror Apollo (APO) CEO Marc Rowan’s view that the US needs to get on board with the energy transition or it risks getting left behind, which is part of why Rowan is “incredibly optimistic” about four more years under Trump. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.) ""Those countries that build power, that support data, that support advanced data, advanced AI, advanced power are going to win,"" Rowan said. ""Those that don't are going to be left behind. This is going to be table stakes.” Innovation fueling change in government is part of the thesis behind Steyer’s latest book, ""Cheaper, Faster, Better."" In the book, the billionaire argues that consumer demand for climate-related innovations, which are often cheaper as well, will drive adoption. One example is electric vehicles. Kelley Blue Book reported that EVs now make up about 9% of the car market in the US, nearing a critical 10% adoption threshold. The falling cost of EV ownership has contributed to this trend. Since this data came out, however, the incoming Trump administration announced it plans to roll back EV tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act, which could reverse this trend. For investors who want high impact and high returns, Steyer said to stick with the fundamentals. “People think that the breakthroughs in the technologies are going be gadgets ... electric vehicles, batteries, things you can touch,"" Steyer said. ""I think there's going be a whole other part of this economy absolutely relevant to climate where returns are going to be really good."" Some areas of investment Steyer is bullish on include real estate, credit, carbon sequestration, and agriculture. Steyer's firm has a real estate fund that focuses on optimizing properties for energy efficiency savings to increase the underlying property value, which fits Steyer’s interest in investments that can solve problems in the next decade rather than over the long term. One such solution that’s getting a lot of attention and investment in the tech world is nuclear energy, with Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Google (GOOG) all pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the space. But Steyer doesn’t see a bull case there yet. “Just being part of the energy transition doesn't necessarily mean that it's a good investment,” he said, adding, “You’d have to be awfully aggressive” to see nuclear fusion energy scale in the next decade. Even nuclear fission, the form of nuclear energy deployed in power plants today, has risks that should be evaluated closely. The success of longer-term bets like nuclear energy may depend on investments from Big Tech, which has been willing to take on riskier investments, since the future of its business depends on energy usage. “Microsoft is definitely really serious about their responsibilities in terms of emissions and climate,"" Steyer said. ""So they're willing to go and try something that's difficult to do and maybe controversial to do.” Regardless of which climate solution wins or who sits in the Oval Office, Steyer believes the momentum toward solving the climate crisis is clear. “In my mind, from the standpoint as an American, I would like to see us continue to be a world leader, both from a business standpoint, an economic standpoint, and also a value standpoint,” he said.

""As Chair Powell said, we serve fixed terms of office and I intend to serve my fixed term of office,"" Michael Barr, the Fed’s vice chair for supervision, told lawmakers on Wednesday when asked what he would do if the president-elect wanted to remove him. Barr's term as vice chair for supervision ends in July 2026, and Powell's term as chair ends in May 2026. Powell has twice this month reinforced his intention to serve out his term as chair, telling reporters he also didn’t intend to go anywhere even if President-elect Trump tried to fire or demote him. ""Not permitted under the law,"" the central bank chair said when reporters asked about it. The comments from Powell and Barr come amid massive uncertainty for the central bank following Trump's election victory. During his first term, then-President Trump attacked Powell with regularity (even though it was Trump who had elevated him to his current role) and openly pushed for the actions he wanted, even once suggesting negative interest rates. The Washington Post has reported that bank executives and former Fed officials expect Trump to demote Barr, who was a Joe Biden appointee and a Treasury official during the Barack Obama era. It is not clear that Trump would have the legal power to make such a move, the Post reported. It’s an unsettled legal question, though, that would hinge on interpretations of Section 10 of the Federal Reserve Act. The law states that each member of the board shall hold office for 14 years ""unless sooner removed for cause by the President."" The question that has been debated for years is what exactly constitutes ""for cause."" The language in the law is plainly more restrictive for Fed officials when compared with the arrangements for cabinet officials and other members of a presidential administration, who are often described as working ""at the pleasure"" of the president. Legal experts have tended to say that a simple policy disagreement wouldn't rise to the level of cause, but it's a standard that hasn't been tested with a judge. Barr has during his term clashed with the US banking industry over a new set of controversial capital rules proposed by Barr and other top bank regulators that would require lenders to set aside greater buffers for future losses. The requirements are based on an international set of capital requirements known as Basel III imposed in the decade following the 2008 financial crisis. Banks have been fighting this US proposal for the last year in an aggressive public campaign and even dropped hints about suing regulators if they don’t get their way. They won a big victory in September when Barr and other regulators said they would water down those requirements. Some in the industry expect regulators to scrap the proposal if Trump wins. Barr told lawmakers Wednesday, ""I expect to work with my new colleagues at the OCC and the FDIC in the coming year"" on those capital rules and other measures.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closed down about 0.3% but still recovered from earlier session lows. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) battled back to finish the day up 0.4% after the index fell below its election breakout level in early trade. But the big winner was the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), which reversed declines to gain over 1%. The index was aided by shares of Nvidia, which rose nearly 5% following a series of bullish notes from Wall Street analysts ahead of its anticipated earnings results on Wednesday. The gains come just one day after the stock was bruised by a report of overheating issues with its flagship new AI product. Earlier in the trading day, investors assessed news that President Vladimir Putin had signed a revised nuclear doctrine that allows Russia to expand its use of atomic weapons. It comes just days after President Joe Biden gave Ukraine the go-ahead to use US long-range missiles to strike inside Russia. Ukraine carried out its first such aerial attack in a border region on Tuesday morning. US bond prices climbed alongside gains for gold (GC=F), and other safe-haven assets as the risk-off trade kicked in. Treasury yields — which move inversely to bond prices — fell, with the 10-year benchmark yield (^TNX) down roughly 4 basis points to around 4.38%. Gold jumped nearly 1% to trade above $2,600 an ounce. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices touched a new record of above $93,500 a token.

Lovers of tennis, baseball, and basketball, beware: Your balls, racquets and bats may soon be pricier. Amer Sports (AS) — the parent company of Wilson, Arc’teryx, Salomon, and other sportswear and sports gear brands — said Trump's promised tariffs would prompt the company to raise prices for sports equipment. ""[O]ur Ball & Racquet segment would be most impacted, predominantly tennis rackets, baseball bats, and basketballs,"" said CFO Andrew Page on an earnings call Tuesday. ""We have some degree of flexibility to adjust our supply chain, but price increases will be the primary tool we utilize should tariffs occur."" Wilson makes tennis rackets and basketballs, while Amer Sports' brands Louisville Slugger, DeMarini, EvoShield, and ATEC make baseball equipment. Trump's tariff promises include 10%-20% tariffs across the board and a 60% tariff on goods from China, and retailers have been working to ease investor anxieties over their potential impact. Amer Sports shares rose over 3% on Tuesday after the company surpassed Wall Street's expectations in its third quarter earnings report. Shares had initially fallen in earlier trade. Here are some of the top trending tickers on the Yahoo Finance homepage: C3.ai (AI): Shares surged over 25% on Tuesday after the company announced an expanded strategic alliance with Microsoft (MSFT). The expansion will accelerate enterprise artificial intelligence adoption on Microsoft Azure. Read more here. Bakkt Holdings (BKKT): Bakkt stock extended gains on Tuesday, rising around 3% after a report from the Financial Times on Monday said Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT), which operates the social network Truth Social, is in advanced talks to acquire the crypto exchange. Bakkt shares had surged over 162% in the immediate aftermath of the report. Read more about the potential acquisition here. Super Micro Computer (SMCI): The stock jumped over 30%, its highest level in two weeks, after the artificial intelligence company said Monday it would stay listed on the Nasdaq as the exchange reviews its compliance plan. The company's stock has been battered over the past few months as investors continue to grapple with the fallout from an August report by short seller firm Hindenburg Research. The report alleged accounting malpractices, violations of export controls, and shady relationships between top executives and Super Micro partners. Read more about SMCI here. Trump confirmed Howard Lutnick, chairman and chief executive of investment firm Cantor Fitzgerald, as his pick for commerce secretary. The confirmation follows multiple reports from earlier in the day. The role has been highly anticipated, as whoever is in charge will be responsible for leading the department that will implement the wide-sweeping tariffs Trump has promised. The president-elect has pledged to impose blanket tariffs of at least 10% on all trading partners, including a 60% tariff on Chinese imports. Lutnick has supported Trump's tariff plan, although he's acknowledged the rollout will likely raise prices in the short term. Walmart (WMT) is the latest — and largest — US company warning about the impact new tariffs could have on prices for US consumers. Following its earnings report on Tuesday, the company told Reuters in a statement: ""We're concerned that significantly increased tariffs could lead to increased costs for our customers at a time when they are still feeling the remnants of inflation."" Walmart spokesperson Molly Blakeman reiterated these concerns in a conversation with Yahoo Finance Tuesday afternoon. Blakeman also noted Walmart sources two-thirds of its products domestically and has been navigating higher tariffs for the past seven years — but the levels to which Trump has proposed raising tariffs (10%-20% tariffs across the board and a 60% tariff on goods from China) has caused ""concern."" On Tuesday, Walmart reported third quarter earnings that topped analysts' expectations, sending the retailers' shares up nearly 4% to a record high in afternoon trade. On Monday night, Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin initiated a 2025 year-end S&P 500 target of 6,500, representing about an 11% gain in the benchmark index from current levels. Kostin and others say the market could surge higher even without the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks' massive outperformance. His work shows that the combination of Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) outperformed the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500 by 63 percentage points in 2023 and 22 percentage points thus far this year. In 2024, this was driven by Magnificent Seven earnings outperforming the rest of the index by 30 percentage points. But that margin is projected to fall to just 6 percentage points in 2025, per consensus estimates. This, Kostin believes, will lead to that cohort beating the other 493 stocks by just 7 percentage points in 2025, the narrowest level of outperformance from the Magnificent Seven dating back to 2018. ""The narrowing differential in earnings growth rates should correspond with a narrowing in relative equity returns,"" Kostin wrote. ""Although the 'micro' earnings growth story supports continued ‘Magnificent 7’ outperformance, more 'macro' factors such as economic growth and trade policy lean in favor of the S&P 493.""'

The cryptocurrency has surged since the Presidential election on November 5, touching a record north of $93,400 last week. Bitcoin has been a key component of the 'Trump trade' as President-elect Donald Trump has promised crypto-friendly policies, including the creation of a bitcoin national stockpile. The move higher also comes on the heels of a Financial Time report stating that Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) is in advanced talks to acquire crypto trading company (BKKT), a tie-up which could further encourage initiatives within the sector. Bitcoin proxy stock MicroStrategy (MSTR) touched new record highs on Tuesday. The software company added 52,000 tokens to its portfolio over the past week — its largest purchase of the cryptocurrency yet. Year-to-date MicroStrategy is up 500%. Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose as much as 2.7% on Tuesday following a series of bullish notes from Wall Street analysts ahead of its earnings report set for Wednesday afternoon. The company also saw a boost following news that one of its customers, cloud provider Nebius Group (NBIS), would open operations in the US with GPU clusters that will use 35,000 Nvidia chips. That's about 4% of the volume of Hopper AI chips Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia to have shipped in the October period, Bloomberg data shows. In a client note this week, Stifel analyst Ruben Roy raised his price target on Nvidia to $180 from $165, while Truist Securities' William Stein raised his price outlook to $167 from $148. Roy cited ""a diverse set of data points,"" including continued high spending on AI infrastructure by hyperscalers and demand for Nvidia's latest Blackwell AI chips. ""We believe that NVDA is well positioned in markets that combine to yield an overall TAM of more than $100 billion exiting 2025 and a longer-term opportunity funnel that could approach $1 trillion."" KeyBanc analysts took a more cautious outlook, lowering their outlook for Nvidia for the January quarter, citing a squeeze on demand in China for Nvidia H20 chips. ""We believe H20 demand in China is getting pushed out as there is increased pressure among China hyperscalers to use domestic AI solutions,"" they wrote in a note Tuesday. They also stated fears that Blackwell chips could cannibalize Nvidia's older-generation Hopper chips. ""Regarding H200, we are hearing that some demand is getting pushed out given the availability of Blackwell (B200)."" Donald Trump will reportedly nominate billionaire Howard Lutnick as commerce secretary, according to multiple reports. Lutnik, the co-chair of Trump's transition team, is also chairman and chief executive of investment firm Cantor Fitzgerald. The role has been highly anticipated, as whoever is in charge will be responsible for leading the department that will implement the wide-sweeping tariffs Trump has promised. The president-elect has pledged to impose blanket tariffs of at least 10% on all trading partners, including a 60% tariff on Chinese imports. Lutnik has supported Trump's tariff plan, although he's acknowledged the rollout will likely raise prices in the short term. That's been a concern among economists, who say it's likely the US could face another inflation resurgence if Trump follows through with his key campaign promises. ""We are in the soft landing,"" Nobel Prize-winning economist and Columbia University professor Joseph Stiglitz said at Yahoo Finance's annual Invest conference last week. ""But that ends Jan. 20.""

Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferré reports: Gold futures (GC=F) hovered at a one-week high to trade near $2,630 per ounce on Tuesday as traders assessed the threat of a nuclear escalation in the Russia-Ukraine war. The precious metal extended its gains from Monday as investors flocked to the asset traditionally seen as a safe haven during times of geopolitical uncertainty. On Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a revised nuclear doctrine, which formally lowered the threshold for Russia's use of its nuclear weapons. The move followed a decision by the Biden administration to allow Ukraine's use of long-range US-made missiles to strike deep into Russia. ""Geopolitical risks have reemerged, driving demand for gold and solidifying its role as a reliable hedging asset,"" Ahmad Assiri, research strategist at foreign exchange broker Pepperstone, said in a note on Tuesday. Gold had been on a tear up until the US elections on Nov. 5. It has since fallen as the US dollar (DX-Y.NYB) strengthened. Still, the precious metal is up about 27% year to date, beating the S&P 500's (^GSPC) gain of 23% over the same period as central banks have boosted their gold reserves. Read more here. It was a tale of two retailers this morning. Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports: Walmart (WMT), the world's biggest retailer, posted fiscal third quarter results that easily beat Wall Street expectations as inflation-weary shoppers continue to search for value. The stock popped over 3%. Sales of $169.59 billion topped analyst estimates for $167.5 billion. Adjusted earnings per share eclipsed estimates by $0.05 at $0.58. The company also raised its guidance for fiscal year 2025 for the third time. Read more here. Lowe's (LOW) stock fell nearly 5% shortly after the opening bell as investors homed in on continued negative sales growth despite results that beat the Street's estimates. The home improvement retailer posted revenue of $20.17 billion, compared to estimates of $19.93 billion. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.89, versus the $2.82 expected. Same-store sales fell 1.1%, less than the 2.7% decline anticipated. The company alluded to ongoing softness in the ""DIY bigger-ticker discretionary demand,"" which was offset by hurricane-related recovery efforts following Hurricanes Helene and Milton and positive same-store sales in its Pro business and online. Read more here. Housing starts fell in October, pressured by a drop in single-family construction. Data from the Census Bureau showed housing starts dropped 3.1% in October to an annual rate of 1.311 million units. Meanwhile, single-family housing starts slipped 6.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 970,000 units, unchanged from a year ago. The decline came as mortgage rates have been climbing, with the average 30-year fixed loan hovering around 6.7%. Rates on a home loan tend to follow US Treasury yields, which have been rising since mid-September partly due to investor anticipation of Trump’s victory and his proposed policies around taxes and tariffs. Higher rates also likely discouraged builders from filing building permits during the month. Contract permits for single family dwellings fell to a pace of 968,000, a 0.5% drop from September’s revised figure of 963,000. ""Major storms likely stalled the beginnings of some residential projects, causing a steep decline in construction in the southeast,"" Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, wrote after the release. ""Both housing starts and building permits declined in October as several homebuilders appeared to hold back the start of projects until after the election. However, more recent surveys showed a rebound in homebuilder confidence."" US stocks fell at the open on Tuesday after President Vladimir Putin signed a revised nuclear doctrine, allowing Russia to expand its use of atomic weapons in a possible escalation of the Russia-Ukraine war. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the declines, down about 0.8%. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid roughly 0.5% to fall below its election breakout level, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also dropped around 0.5% on the heels of a mixed day for the major gauges. Super Micro Computer (SMCI), an AI server maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner, soared over 25% premarket Tuesday. The sprint higher came after the company on Monday submitted a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission saying that it's supplied a compliance plan with the Nasdaq to avoid delisting. Also boosting the stock, Super Micro said it's hired a new auditor, BDO, after its prior accountant, Ernst & Young, resigned in late October. The company was in hot water with the Nasdaq after delaying both its annual and quarterly filings to the SEC following a scathing report from short-selling firm Hindenburg Research. The report shed light on potential accounting malpractices, violations of export controls, and shady relationships between top executives and Super Micro partners. The company is reportedly being investigated by the Department of Justice. Even with this week's surge, shares have tumbled roughly 56% over the past three months. After gaining as much as 300% earlier this year, SMCI stock is now down over 20% in 2024. Read the full story here.

Here are the company's e-commerce results by division for the third quarter reported this morning: These results are eye-popping for two reasons: 1) Walmart isn't exactly a startup; 2) the competition online is as fierce as ever. I am talking to Walmart CFO John David Rainey live at 9:15 a.m. ET on Yahoo Finance. Rest assured, we will ask him about these online sales numbers! Hat tip to Goldman Sachs' chief US equity strategist David Kostin for calling out specific stocks in his 2025 outlook piece that just dropped. So often these year-end works of art from investment bank strategists simply serve up S&P 500 (^GSPC) targets, with various underlying scenarios explained. But usually, no stock predictions. Kostin is calling out another year of strong performance for the Mag 7 trade, just not as hot as recent years. Says Kostin: It's a good point by Kostin, and comes in the face of all these Mag 7 stocks trading at rich multiples on hearty outlooks for profit growth. There is only so far you can push a stock price using reasonable future financial assumptions! You can tool around with Mag 7 valuations on Yahoo Finance's new stock comparison tool here. As I noted on Monday in our blog, expectations on Nvidia's (NVDA) earnings and outlook are very robust ... to say the very least. If there is one thing that could trip up the bullish trade the morning after earnings, it's Nvidia's guidance. While it will likely be above consensus, it may not be above consensus enough given the dynamics around Blackwell chip demand. Nvidia could opt to go stronger with guidance when it reports three months from now or so. Important point on this from Stifel analyst Ruben Roy this morning in a note:","US stocks mixed on Tuesday as Wall shrugged off fears over a nuclear escalation to the Russia-Ukraine Nvidia (NVDA) provided a solid boost for the tech-heavy Nasdaq.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-robert-f-kennedy-jr-could-impact-the-healthcare-sector-as-secretary-of-health-182748442.html,"Mon, Nov 18, 2024, 11:27 AM","President-elect Donald Trump's nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the nation’s top health agency sent healthcare stocks sliding last week. Vaccine makers like Moderna (MRNA) were down more than 5%, while larger companies like Pfizer PFE (PFE) were down about 2%. Some Wall Street analysts said the slide was an overreaction and that it's too early to tell if or how much Kennedy could impact the healthcare sector since little is known about the controversial pick's actual policies and he has yet to be confirmed by the US Senate. If confirmed as secretary of Health and Human Services, Kennedy would oversee the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). JPMorgan healthcare analyst Chris Schott said in a note to clients that the sector is facing “a period of max uncertainty” until the Cabinet position is filled and more is known about Kennedy. But, Schott added, it also means that the large-cap stocks, as a whole, are currently trading at a 35% discount to the S&P 500, leaving room for future upside rather than more downside trading. Mizuho’s healthcare sector expert Jared Holz said in a note to clients that he agrees with some of the big-picture issues Kennedy has identified, such as America's obesity epidemic and the dangers of ultra-processed foods. “The country should be much healthier than it is and there is a ton of room for improvement, including nutrition, food production, consumption, etc. This is a very complicated topic and always has been,” Holz said. Here's some of what we do know about Kennedy's views on major healthcare topics. Vaccines: Known as an anti-vaxxer, Kennedy has questioned the need to vaccinate children and refused to get a COVID-19 vaccine, concerning some Wall Street analysts about his possible effect on the vaccine industry and how he could influence the childhood vaccine schedule, as well as the regulatory process to test and approve vaccines and other treatments. There is also speculation he and Trump’s government efficiency appointees, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, could gut the FDA. Vaccine stocks were hurt the most on the news of Kennedy's nomination, despite him previously saying he wasn’t “taking away” anybody’s vaccines. GLP-1s: RFK has said he doesn’t believe the weekly injectables are the solution to the country’s obesity problem. It is unclear if he could derail current efforts by GLP-1 makers to gain Medicare coverage, which is currently not allowed for obesity. Companies are studying the drugs' impacts on obesity-related diseases such as heart disease and sleep apnea, which are covered by Medicare and would therefore open up federal dollars for purchase. A recent report showed Medicaid, which would also be under Kennedy's purview, has contributed significantly to sales of the injectables compared to employer-sponsored and commercial insurance plans. Some analysts fear Kennedy's positions could limit access to the drugs and levels of coverage, potentially impacting the fortunes of market leaders Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO). Holz, however, said he “still believes GLP-1s will be the largest therapeutic category by a wide margin despite some comments from RFK noting that Americans should use other non-drug methods in order to lose weight.” Drug pricing: With oversight of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Kennedy would have a chance to negotiate more or less aggressively with pharmaceutical companies than the Biden administration. That is, of course, if the Trump administration chooses to continue exercising the new powers established by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). ""President Trump will still be focused on this issue and could seek to 'get a better deal' via IRA negotiations than the Biden administration,"" Leerink Partners said in a note. Food regulations: Kennedy has been vocal about prioritizing the regulation of ultra-processed foods. Studies show these foods are contributing to obesity in the country. It's a policy the current FDA commissioner, Robert Califf, has already spoken about, and the agency has been looking to issue new rules on labeling, as well as better research on the impacts of these foods. While of more concern to food stocks than healthcare, the issue is related to his stance on obesity and GLP-1s. It is unclear how Kennedy would tackle this issue.

The home improvement retailer posted revenue of $20.17 billion, compared to estimates of $19.93 billion. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.89, versus the $2.82 expected. ""Our results this quarter were modestly better-than-expected, even excluding storm-related activity, driven by high-single-digit positive comps in Pro, strong online sales and smaller-ticket outdoor DIY projects,"" Lowe's CEO Marvin Ellison wrote in the earnings release. Same-store sales growth was down 1.1%, less than the 2.7% decline anticipated. Continuing softness from DIY shoppers was partially offset by hurricane-related recovery efforts following Hurricanes Helene and Milton and positive same-store sales in its Pro business and online. ""Consumers continue to face affordability challenges as both inflation and interest rates are putting pressure on their [wallets]. Mortgage rates also remained stubbornly high,"" Ellison said on Lowe's earnings call. The 30-year fixed rate mortgage edged higher again this week, hitting 6.61%. ""Combined with the lack of available homes for sale, housing turnover remains near 30-year lows,"" Ellison added. ""It's unclear when lower rates and improved consumer sentiment will translate into improved home improvement demand."" TD Cowen analyst Max Rakhlenko wrote that the company is ""well positioned for the next Home Improvement Cycle."" Positive catalysts in the near future include more Fed rate cuts, hurricane-related recovery efforts, and normalizing ""post-pandemic demand trends,"" Telsey Advisory Group's Joe Feldman wrote in a note to clients prior to results.

In Q3, the Pro business grew by high single-digits, driven by investments the company made to ""better serve"" small and medium-size core Pro customers. However, DIY customers makes up roughly 75% of Lowe's business. Lowe's stock moved 3% lower in early trading on Tuesday. The company is expected to end the year with total net sales in the range of $83 billion to $83.5 billion, slightly higher than the previously expected range of $82.7 billion to $83.2 billion. Same-store sales growth is projected to end the year down 3% to 3.5% year over year, compared to the previously expected decline of 3.5% to 4%. The company is expected to host an analyst and investor conference in December, where it plans to discuss ""new growth and productivity initiatives"" and explain how it's ""well-positioned to capitalize on the expected recovery in home improvement."" ""Lowe's is lapping difficult comparisons from the past four years fueled by higher home values and heightened home-related spending as a result of the pandemic,"" Feldman wrote. Last week, Home Depot (HD) posted results that beat estimates across all key metrics. Revenue jumped 6.6% year over year to $40.22 billion, compared to the $39.29 billion expected. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $3.78 versus estimates of $3.66. Same-store sales dropped 1.30%, less than the estimated 3.01% decline. Bank of America analyst Robby Ohmes said Lowe's ""continues to gain traction with its Total Home Strategy."" ""We expect these initiatives, which include improved service, investment in inventory depth, store remodels, Lowe's MVP Pro Rewards program, its CRM [customer relationship management] system, and online & digital tools, to support market share gains and to aid in longer-term growth in sales per square foot,"" he wrote to clients.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-rally-stumbles-with-nvidia-earnings-on-tap-what-to-know-this-week-123851710.html,"Mon, Nov 18, 2024, 3:01 AM","The feverish post-election stock market rally came to a screeching halt last week. For the week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell more than 2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) shed more than 500 points or nearly 1.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) sank over 3%. Two firm inflation readings and commentary from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell weighed on markets last week, with growing uncertainty over the Fed's rate path outweighing previous investor excitement over Trump's potential policy agenda. In the week ahead, a few economic data releases are expected to add to that narrative, with activity in the services and manufacturing sector and a consumer sentiment reading headlining the schedule. Earnings, however, will bring attention back to some of the biggest names in the corporate world after a few weeks of macro and political events dominating investor mindshare. Key among these reports will be earnings from AI leader Nvidia (NVDA), which is set to report results after the bell on Wednesday. Quarterly results from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), BJ's (BJ), and Deere & Company (DE) will also be in focus. Since the Federal Reserve slashed its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point on Sept. 18, bond yields have ripped higher. The 10-year Treasury (^TNX) yield rose by 80 basis points between that date and the days following the election to trade near 4.5%. That move in rates hadn't been an issue for the stock market rally until last week. While strategists have pointed out that a move higher in rates supported by stronger-than-expected economic growth could be welcome news for stocks, recent inflation data has thrown a wrench in that thesis. On Wednesday, the ""core"" Consumer Price Index (CPI), which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, showed prices increased 3.3% annually for the third consecutive month during October. On Thursday, the ""core"" Producer Price Index (PPI) revealed prices increased by 3.1% over last year in October, up from 2.8% the month prior and above economist expectations for a 3% increase. Later on Thursday, Powell said in a speech the Fed doesn't need to be ""in a hurry"" to lower interest rates given the strength of the US economy. Markets moved lower on the comments, and the selling continued on Friday, with the Nasdaq Composite sliding more than 2.2% for the session. ""Slower progress on inflation in recent months may prompt the Fed to reevaluate its pace of easing moving forward,"" Wells Fargo's economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a weekly note to clients on Friday. As of Friday afternoon, investors were pricing in a 58% chance the Fed cuts interest rates by 25 basis points at its December meeting, down from the nearly 86% chance seen a month ago, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Schwab Asset Management CEO and chief investment officer Omar Aguilar told Yahoo Finance Powell's comments and the Fed debate add uncertainty and ""additional volatility and, therefore, the opportunity for investors to take something off the table and take some profits."" Amid all the macro headlines influencing the stock market in November, S&P 500 companies have posted solid third quarter earnings. The S&P 500 has grown earnings by 5.4% compared to the same quarter a year prior, marking the fifth straight quarter of earnings growth, per FactSet data. And one of the index's largest contributors to that expected growth is slated to report earnings this week. Nvidia is expected to report earnings per share of $0.74 on revenue of $33.21 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus data. Both metrics would represent more than 80% growth compared to the same period a year prior. ""We expect a similar story to the last several quarters with a beat and raise in the $2B range [for current quarter revenue guidance],"" Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis wrote in a research note previewing the release. Curtis noted that expectations have continued to ""creep higher"" as Nvidia shares have rallied more than 7% in the past month and are up more than 180% this year. But Curtis believes the stock ""continues to work"" as Nvidia continues with the release of its latest AI chip, Blackwell. Given Nvidia's large weighting in the S&P 500, its earnings for the past couple of quarters have been viewed as a key catalyst for the market's overall direction. And while investors will be listening for any clues about which Big Tech companies continue to spend with the AI chip leader, the actual price action of Nvidia's stock after earnings hasn't been a barometer for broader market performance in the near term. For example, Nvidia's (NVDA) August earnings release did little to impress investors and the stock fell about 6% the day after its earnings release. But that sour sentiment didn't permeate through the market as the S&P 500 closed flat on that same day. This marked the second straight quarter that the broader S&P 500 didn't move with Nvidia following its earnings release. Some of the biggest winners in the market since Donald Trump won the presidential election on Nov. 5 have reversed course. The Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) has given back nearly all of its gains. The S&P 500 closed Friday below where it opened the day after the election. And the small-cap Russell 2000 (^RUT) index, which soared more than 9% following Trump's victory, has now given back about half of those gains. For small caps, the story isn't much different than a week ago, when we noted Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz's concern about earnings momentum for companies in the index. ""In the last 20 days ... we've definitely seen small cap estimates at the margin move pretty sharply lower,"" Kantrowitz said. He added that investors would want to see earnings accelerating to signal the start of a recovery. ""[It's] not something we're seeing quite yet,"" Kantrowitz said. ""So something we'll be monitoring."" The move in small caps is emblematic of the uneven trading action in the two weeks following the election, as any impact from the Trump administration's policies largely remains to be seen. ""Key economic positions have not been announced, and we remain in a policy uncertainty backdrop,"" Citi US equity strategist Scott Chronert wrote in a note to clients when explaining the recent drawdown in the market rally. ""We are working from euphoric sentiment levels and implicit growth expectations at post-2008 highs,"" he added. ""Overall, there is a lot of pressure on macros and fundamentals to deliver, which may explain some recent profit taking after a rapid post-election run.""

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-stock-recovers-from-losses-after-technical-glitches-disrupt-the-jake-paul-mike-tyson-boxing-match-165922126.html,"Mon, Nov 18, 2024, 12:27 PM","Netflix (NFLX) shares recovered from earlier losses on Monday after the streaming giant's highly anticipated boxing event between heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and YouTube personality Jake Paul experienced technical glitches throughout the live broadcast. The issues have sparked concerns about the company's ability to deliver other types of live programs, especially with the upcoming NFL Christmas Day games in just over a month. Customers complained about buffering disruptions and streaming issues while watching the event Friday night. Downdetector, which tracks internet outages, received thousands of outage reports throughout the evening. Netflix declined to directly comment on the glitches when asked by Yahoo Finance. Since the start of the year, Netflix shares have surged over 70%, far outpacing the broader markets and streaming rivals, including Disney (DIS) and Comcast (CMCSA). Shares climbed more than 2% in afternoon trade on Monday. Bandwidth issues were likely at fault: The company revealed 60 million households around the world tuned in to watch. It alluded to the technical problems in an Instagram post, saying the event ""even had our buffering systems on the ropes."" But it's not the first time Netflix has faced technical glitches from its various live events, which have included comedy specials and reunion tapings. That's led to investor concerns the company won't be able to get things right in time for its NFL Christmas Day doubleheader, with the Kansas City Chiefs vs. Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens vs. Houston Texans. Multiple users on social media platforms vented their frustrations, explicitly calling out the streaming issues and disruptions throughout the night. Still, Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein shrugged off the customer complaints, writing in a note to clients on Sunday that viewing was likely twice as large as the company's internal expectations, ""a high quality problem than can be easily fixed by Christmas Day."" Netflix inked a three-season deal with the NFL earlier this year to air the Christmas Day games, which will be produced by CBS Sports (PARA). The streamer reportedly coughed up about $75 million per game, according to the Wall Street Journal. Late Sunday, the company announced Beyoncé as the headline performer during the Ravens vs. Texans halftime show. It will be the first time the artist will perform her Grammy-nominated album ""Cowboy Cater"" live. Assuming 2.5 viewers per household, Helfstein estimated about 150 million global viewers tuned in to watch the Tyson-Paul event. That's greater than the 124 million US viewers who watched the 2024 Super Bowl, the highest viewership for any US broadcast. The analyst, who has an Outperform rating on shares, called out Netflix's ability to generate massive viewership, ""suggesting the company will be successful with advertising around live events."" Last week, Netflix said its ad tier, now two years old, has reached 70 million global monthly active users, a significant jump from the 40 million users the company revealed at its second Upfront presentation in May. Of note: Monthly active users, otherwise known as MAUs, are not the same as paying subscribers. The company has yet to reveal actual subscriber figures for the ad tier or how much revenue it's generated so far. MAUs can include multiple people using the same account. Netflix recently beat Wall Street expectations across every major financial metric in its third quarter results on Oct. 17, with shares surging to all-time highs as many analysts call Netflix the winner of the hard-fought streaming wars. Still, the company recently revealed that year-over-year engagement levels came in roughly flat — a potential headwind when it comes to the company's ability to raise prices and boost growth. ""With much of the subscriber growth seemingly representing improved monetization of an existing (and not growing) user base, we question whether the momentum can continue into next year,"" MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote in a recent note to clients. Valuation has also been a concern, with Fishman adding that Netflix's stock ""is massively expensive for a company whose own guidance implies a revenue deceleration into 2025."" Last month, Netflix said its revenue growth is expected to slow from an expected 15% this year to between 11% and 13% in 2025. Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/there-are-no-natural-sellers-in-stocks-blackrocks-rick-rieder-140947430.html,"Mon, Nov 18, 2024, 6:09 AM","Stocks stalled out last week following their post-election pop, but strategists, including Rick Rieder of BlackRock and John Stoltzfus of Oppenheimer, are still longer-term bulls. “There are no natural sellers,” Rieder said at the recent Yahoo Finance Invest conference. He’s the chief investment officer of fixed income for the asset management giant, and his remit also includes overseeing $150 billion of equities. Rieder said there are two forces supporting equities. First, earnings are growing. “I think the multiples are high. But if you think the E in PE [price-earnings ratio] is going to be significantly higher, you get that multiple to a reasonable level.” Second, “The technicals are crazy for equities,” Rieder said. That’s in part because of the lack of sellers, as the massive amount of dollars in 401(k)s allocated to stocks, plus companies buying back their own shares, provides lots of buyers. As for Stoltzfus, the chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management, he just raised his year-end 2024 target for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) for the third time. He was one of the most bullish strategists on the Street coming into the year, and he now sees the index closing out at 6,200. (He has yet to set his forecast for 2025). Stoltzfus told Yahoo Finance in an interview that stocks, the economy, and business growth have continued to defy expectations. ""Second and third quarter earnings growth and revenue growth have outperformed consensus expectations,"" he said. ""We were looking for much less growth. And then the Fed has been remarkably successful [at averting a recession]. The consumer and jobs have all proven resilient, even if slowing somewhat is a result of the effects of the Fed going after inflation for over two, two and a half years."" Of course, that’s not even factoring in the fiscal policy of the incoming Trump administration, which many strategists expect to help further juice growth. One of them is Ed Yardeni, who recently set a target of 7,000 for the S&P 500 for the end of 2025 and said the election had reignited “animal spirits” in the market. “I think we're just seeing a more pro-business administration coming in that undoubtedly will cut taxes,” Yardeni said in an interview with Yahoo Finance. “And not only for corporations but also for individuals.

Bakkt stock gained over 162% on Monday following the report. The company is majority-owned by NYSE parent company Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). President-elect Donald Trump maintains a roughly 60% interest in DJT, which boasts a market cap of around $7.1 billion. Trump reiterated earlier this month that he has no intention of selling his stock in the company. Trump's election win has pushed bitcoin prices to all-time highs, with the administration viewed as generally more friendly to the alternative asset class. In July, Trump attended a bitcoin conference in Nashville and has since pledged to usher in more supportive regulation. His promises also include appointing a crypto Presidential Advisory Council and firing current SEC Chair Gary Gensler. On Monday, bitcoin (BTC-USD) rose over 2% to trade just below $92,000 a token. Other crypto-adjacent names were also on the move higher. Shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR), which owns nearly 280,000 bitcoins, closed almost 13% higher after it announced the purchase of an additional 51,780 bitcoins for $4.6 billion. The company now holds $16.5 billion worth of bitcoin. Coinbase (COIN) stock also jumped over 6% on Monday, with the Wall Street Journal reporting its CEO, Brian Armstrong, was set to meet with Trump. Bakkt, which has a market cap of around $190 million, has seen its stock fall sharply since going public in 2021. Intercontinental Exchange, its majority owner, is led by CEO Jeff Sprecher, who is married to former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler, co-chair of Trump's inaugural committee. Trump founded Truth Social after he was kicked off major social media apps like Facebook (META) and Twitter, now X, following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots. Trump has since been reinstated on those platforms. He officially returned to posting on X in mid-August after about a year's hiatus. As Truth Social attempts to take on social media incumbents, the fundamentals of the company have long been in question. On Nov. 5, just a few hours before the polls closed, DJT dropped third quarter results that revealed a net loss of $19.25 million for the quarter ending Sept. 30. DJT also reported revenue of $1.01 million. It held about $370 million in cash at the end of the quarter. The stock is up 10% over the last month.

His thesis estimates that autonomous driving alone represents a $1 trillion opportunity for Tesla as the federal government under Trump clears the regulatory ""spiderweb"" that has been weighing on Musk's vision for self-driving cars. A spokeswoman for the Trump transition didn't directly address the report about a federal self-driving framework, only saying that Trump will deliver on the promises he made during the campaign. Musk has been teasing autonomous capabilities in Tesla vehicles for years. In 2019, the company was preparing an entire ride-sharing vehicle fleet and predicted there would be over a million robotaxis on the road by 2020. That didn't happen. But last month, he unveiled the Cybercab, a self-driving EV with no steering wheel or pedals that he said would carry a $30,000 price tag. Musk speculated it could be available ""before 2027"" though he admitted he tends to be optimistic with timelines. While gauging Tesla's outlook under Trump, Ives maintained his outperform rating and $400 price target on the stock. He added that the path to a $1.5 trillion and then a $2 trillion valuation will play out over the next 12 to 18 months, with the Cybercab representing ""the golden goose.""

He is scheduled to be sentenced on March 19. Prosecutors charged Thompson this month with making about $771,678 in profit from 69 illegal trades in more than seven financial institutions. The banks weren’t identified by prosecutors, but a separate US Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit filed Nov. 8 against Thompson identified at least two of them as New York Community Bancorp and Capital One Financial Corp. Thompson, who worked at the regulator for two decades, recently managed a team that supervised and conducted exams of US banks with at least $100 billion in assets, excluding the eight largest, according to the SEC. In his role, he was prohibited from trading shares of banks and was required to disclose every year any conflicts of interest or bank holdings. The Federal Reserve has come under scrutiny for trading by officials, including two former policymakers who were cleared of wrongdoing earlier this year following an internal probe into trades they made in 2020. The Fed has since imposed new rules that bar top officials from purchasing individual stocks and bonds, limited trading and required the sale of certain assets before joining the regulator. Thompson had regular access to confidential information about banks, including unreleased earnings data; capital, liquidity, and risk levels; and records of bank examinations, stress tests, and other regulatory events, according to the SEC complaint. In October 2023, Thompson received an email from a Fed colleague revealing Capital One would report earnings exceeding analysts’ estimates, according to the SEC. Thompson purchased shares hours before the earnings release and made about $79,346 in profit when the shares rose after the results were made public, according to the lawsuit. In January, Thompson found out that New York Community Bancorp planned to announce unexpected and significant losses from loans it took on as part of its March 2023 purchase of Signature Bank, according to the SEC. He purchased put options, which is essentially betting that the bank’s stock would fall, according to the lawsuit. Thompson ended up making $505,527, or a 3,745.2% return from the trade, the regulator alleged. The case is US v. Thompson, 24-cr-164, US District Court, Eastern District of Virginia (Richmond).

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/singapore-oil-tycoon-ok-lim-072027017.html,"Mon, Nov 18, 2024, 2:04 AM","(Bloomberg) -- A Singapore court has sentenced oil tycoon Lim Oon Kuin to 17-and-half years in jail for cheating HSBC Holdings Plc and instigating forgery, in a case that has shaken the city-state’s commodity-trading community. Most Read from Bloomberg Saudi Neom Gets $3 Billion Loan Guarantee From Italy Export Credit Agency Sace The Urban-Rural Divide Over Highway Expansion and Emissions The 82-year-old founder of Hin Leong Trading Pte., who has appeared for court hearings in a wheelchair, faced three out of more than 100 charges initially presented. Lim and his children had already agreed in September to pay $3.6 billion to the company’s liquidators and creditor HSBC in a separate, civil, case, and have filed for bankruptcy. Judge Toh Han Li said at Singapore’s State Courts on Monday that the case involved some of the most serious cheating offenses seen in the country to date. A “deterrent” sentence was justified, he said, adding there would be no major concessions for Lim’s medical condition. A Mandarin speaker with limited English, Lim listened to the sentencing through a translator. His lawyer Davinder Singh, a top litigator whose clients have included the nation’s first prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, has appealed on behalf of his client. Lim will not begin to serve his sentence until after the appeal hearing. OK Lim, as he is widely known, built up his company from a one-truck operation into a family-held powerhouse. Traders, analysts and lawyers interviewed by Bloomberg described a young immigrant whose grit and business acumen were as notable as his iron fist in the early years, expanding along with the country’s profile as a commodity trading hub. Hin Leong, at its peak, traded a range of oil products, made lubricants and operated loading terminals and storage facilities. Its affiliate had a fleet of more than 100 ships transporting fuel across the world. But when Lim’s downfall came in 2020, as Covid—19 sent oil prices into freefall, it was swift. A bad bet that China’s swift containment of the coronavirus would turn the crude market around exposed $800 million of hidden futures losses. Other practices later uncovered included using single cargoes to obtain multiple loans. While the company’s official paperwork pointed to an annual profit, it had in reality been operating in the red for years, he said at the time. It was a shocking demise for the industry and for Singapore, still recovering from other trading and accounting scandals including Noble Group Ltd, Agritrade International Pte., ZenRock Commodities Trading Pte. and Hontop Energy (Singapore) Pte. Ltd., that threatened the nation’s squeaky-clean reputation. Risk Taker Born in China’s Fujian province, Lim started as a small wholesaler of fuel to local transport companies and fishing boats. He would go on to leverage his strength in logistics to build a regional distribution network serving frontier Asian markets such as Vietnam and later, Myanmar. Interviews with those who knew Lim at his peak, most of whom declined to be named given the sensitivity of the topic, paint a picture of a low-key figure, with a rags-to-riches path that led to wealth he generally preferred not to flaunt. In his own testimony, he described his upbringing as the son of a fisherman, working odd jobs to make ends meet before joining the suppliers that sold fuel for the family boat. But the oil trading heavyweight was also a keen poker player and risk taker, and he made the most of the opacity of the oil trading world. His trades, bold and aggressive, became legendary. “OK Lim was a pioneer in Singapore and Asia’s oil-trading industry, and a success story,” said John Driscoll, a veteran Singapore-based trader who traded alongside Lim in the 1990s and 2000s. “While he has to face up to his wrongdoings and the collapse of his company, it doesn’t take away from the man’s legacy and the rags-to-riches story of what was once the country’s leading oil merchant.” Hin Leong got its break in the 1990s, when Lim and his son, Evan Lim, began participating in a trading and price assessment platform run by what’s now known as S&P Global. As part of this mechanism, market players submit bids and offers for small parcels of oil that will go into determining the cost of fuel at hubs such as Singapore. They also provide physical deliveries for transactions on the so-called market-on-close (MOC) window. Before long, Hin Leong became an active player, dominating regional diesel and fuel oil markets as his company expanded to include the ownership of onshore storage tanks and a fleet of tankers doubling up as floating storage, from which large volumes could be delivered. As China expanded and ships stopped in Singapore for fuel, Hin Leong was there to supply it. The hidden losses and ultimate collapse of the company, first reported by Bloomberg in 2020, brought all of that to a halt. He was convicted in May this year and has since presented himself as a much-diminished figure. OK Lim and his family’s assets, including some of Singapore’s most valuable houses in prestigious districts, have been up for sale. Proceeds will go to the judicial managers of Hin Leong.

Rising tensions between Ukraine and Russia triggered a rally that was later muted by Iran’s agreement on nuclear fuel. Brent settled little changed above $73 a barrel. Heating up geopolitical risk, Ukrainian forces carried out their first strike on a border region in Russia using Western-supplied missiles, and President Vladimir Putin approved an updated nuclear doctrine expanding the conditions for using atomic weapons. Meanwhile, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Iran agreed to stop producing near bomb-grade uranium, a move some traders interpreted as designed to avoid maximum-pressure sanctions. While geopolitical developments have pushed crude up at times this year, oil is still slightly lower for 2024 amid concerns about Chinese demand and plentiful global supply. The prompt spread for WTI — the difference between the two nearest futures contracts — traded in a bearish contango structure on Monday for the first time in nine months, a sign near-term supplies may be exceeding demand. Also keeping a lid on prices, Lebanon and the Hezbollah militia have agreed to a US proposal for a cease-fire with Israel, according to a report from Reuters on Monday that cited a top Lebanese official. A US official cautioned that negotiations were ongoing. On the supply side, Equinor ASA restored production at the Johan Sverdrup oil field in the North Sea to two-thirds of capacity after halting output the previous day. The International Energy Agency has forecast a potential surplus of more than 1 million barrels a day next year as Chinese demand continues to falter, which could be even bigger if OPEC+ decides to revive output.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/feds-bowman-calls-cautious-approach-171703245.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 9:17 AM","(Reuters) - Federal Reserve Governor Michelle Bowman, among the U.S. central bank's most hawkish policymakers, on Wednesday called for a cautious approach to any further interest rate cuts, noting that inflation remains a concern and the labor market is strong. The Fed reduced its policy rate earlier this month by a quarter of a percentage point to the 4.50%-4.75% range, a move that Bowman said she supported because it aligns with her preference for lowering short-term borrowing costs gradually. Bowman had cast a lone dissent on the Fed's half-percentage-point rate reduction in November. With inflation still elevated and progress toward the Fed's 2% goal looking to have stalled, Bowman said in remarks prepared for delivery in West Palm Beach, Florida to the Forum Club of the Palm Beaches, ""I would prefer to proceed cautiously in bringing the policy rate down to better assess how far we are from the end point, while recognizing that we have not yet achieved our inflation goal and closely watching the evolution of the labor market."" Bowman said she believes the neutral policy rate - the level of borrowing costs that neither bolsters nor brakes economic growth - is much higher that it was before the COVID pandemic, ""and therefore we may be closer to a neutral policy stance than we currently think."" Indeed, she added, ""we should also not rule out the risk that the policy rate may attain or even fall below its neutral level before we achieve our price stability goal."" Bowman said she would watch incoming data and meet with a broad range of contacts before the Fed's Dec. 17-18 meeting to assess the appropriateness of the current policy stance, and signaled that she feels the central bank is under no constraint to deliver another rate cut, as markets currently expect. ""I am pleased that the November post-meeting statement included a flexible, data-dependent approach, providing the (Federal Open Market) Committee with optionality in deciding future policy adjustments,"" she said. The bigger risk for the Fed is to its price stability goal, though deterioration in labor conditions is possible, she said.

The assets of such funds swelled last week to $7 trillion for the first time ever, defying speculation that investors would pull out cash once the Fed started nudging interest rates down from a more than two-decade high.

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll In Cleveland, a Forgotten Streetcar Bridge Gets a Long-Awaited Lift A Bug’s Eye View of Mexico City’s Modernist Architecture Amtrak Wins $300 Million to Fix Its Unreliable NJ-to-NYC Service Trump has said he’ll push America’s shale companies to ramp up output – telling supporters pump prices would fall even if it meant producers “drill themselves out of business” — but his second term follows two straight years of record US output. Against that backdrop, analysts and traders surveyed by Bloomberg see the US adding just 251,000 barrels a day from the end of this year through 2025, the slowest pace since the pandemic-driven drop in 2020. There are few levers Trump can pull to change that. Opening new federal lands to exploration would take time, and some of his other proposals – such as a trade war with China – are widely seen as bearish for oil because they would erode demand for the commodity. “There’s a delay between freeing up federal lands, offering it for auction, having companies bid on it, doing exploration, discovering oil and putting the infrastructure for it,” said Ed Morse, a senior adviser at commodities trading firm Hartree Partners LP. The bulk of any production increases stemming from Trump policies would come after his term, Morse said. So far, the independent oil producers responsible for most of the shale boom over the past decade have no plans to radically alter their drilling after the election. Diamondback Energy Inc. and Devon Energy Corp. indicated growth of 2% or less in 2025, while EOG Resources Inc. and Occidental Petroleum Corp. expect to keep activity flat. Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub has warned of “declining growth rates” in the US over the medium term. There is cause for skepticism, of course. Last year, the shale patch surprised the market by adding 1 million barrels a day of output, despite independent producers vowing limited growth. And heavyweight producers including Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and ConocoPhillips are expanding rapidly, posting increases of more than 8% in the past year. Macquarie Group Ltd., which correctly predicted last year’s stunning growth, sees output reaching an unprecedented 13.9 million barrels a day by the end of this year, 5% above current Department of Energy estimates. That growth, combined with new barrels from Guyana, Brazil and Canada, have set the stage for a massive crude glut in 2025, with the International Energy Agency warning of a 1 million barrel-a-day global supply surplus. Macquarie sees supply outpacing demand by 2.4 million barrels a day in the first quarter, when Trump will be sworn in. And traders are already pricing in a surplus, with West Texas Intermediate retreating by more than 3% this year. READ: World Oil Market Faces Million-Barrel Glut in 2025, IEA Says It’s a much different landscape than when Trump first took the White House. In 2017, new investment from private equity and the supermajors was flowing into the oil patch — prompting producers to grow as fast as possible and burning $300 billion of cash in the process. The pandemic tanked prices, caused labor shortages in the shale patch, stranded imports of equipment in ports and prompted banks to dial back lending to the sector. Dozens of bankruptcies followed. But those that survived were forced to lower costs and become more efficient, positioning them to begin growing again when oil prices rallied in late 2020.

That pace will be hard to maintain. A $290 billion wave of mergers and acquisitions in the past two years means many of the independent producers that were driving production growth during Trump’s first time in office were bought or merged into larger entities that reined in capital spending and boosted shareholder returns. Among the deals, Pioneer Natural Resources Co. was bought by Exxon, Endeavor Energy Resources LP was taken out by Diamondback, and CrownRock LP was acquired by Occidental. Ultimately, though, oil prices could be the biggest obstacle to US growth, according Raoul LeBlanc, vice president for North American unconventionals at S&P Global Commodity Insights. “At $70, shale independents can both grow and generate free cash flow,” he said. “But at $60 they have to make a choice — and we believe they’ll choose cash for the shareholders.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Jaylen Brown Is Taking On Nike With $200 Sneakers Trump’s Impossible Task: Delivering for the Working Class and Billionaires Wall Street Is Too Pumped About Trump to Worry About His Policies Why Tech Billionaires Love the Author of Jurassic Park Democrats Let MAGA Co-Opt the Healthy Food Movement ©2024 Bloomberg L.P.","-- President-elect vows to “frack, are about to collide with a global crude set to, finally, temper record Most from Bloomberg Replace Parking Spaces With York’s Transit Agency $9 Toll Cleveland, a Forgotten Streetcar Gets a Long-Awaited Lift A Bug’s Eye View Mexico City’s Modernist Architecture Wins $300 Million Its NJ-to-NYC has said he’ll push America’s companies ramp up output pump prices would fall even if meant producers themselves out of business” but second term follows two years of record output.

Safe-haven currencies such as the Japanese yen, Swiss franc and the greenback saw a brief boost on Tuesday before fading. Russia's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said that country would ""do everything possible"" to avoid nuclear war, hours after Moscow announced it would lower its threshold for a nuclear strike. Even with the recent pause, the dollar index has rallied about 3% since the U.S. election on growing expectations the Fed may slow its path of interest-rate cuts on concerns Trump's policies could reignite inflation. ""There's a lot of pessimism about Fed rate cuts that we think (is) misplaced,"" said Jay Hatfield, CEO at Infrastructure Capital Advisors in New York. ""The rest of the world, except for Japan, has to cut because they have zero growth, basically, and without the U.S. they'd be in a recession. So then the big variable is the U.S. Everybody is super-bearish, in our opinion too bearish, about Fed cuts."" The dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of currencies, rose 0.53% to 106.66, with the euro down 0.56% at $1.0536. Expectations for the path of rate cuts have been scaled back, while volatile, in recent weeks. Markets are pricing in a 59.1% chance of a 25-basis-point cut at the Fed's December meeting, down from 82.5% a week ago, according to CME's FedWatch Tool. A Reuters poll showed most economists expect the Fed to cut rates at its December meeting, with shallower cuts in 2025 than expected a month ago due to the risk of higher inflation from Trump's policies. Recent comments from Fed officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, have pointed to the central bank being slow and measured in its rate-cut path. Against the Japanese yen, the dollar strengthened 0.36% to 155.2. The dollar had strengthened as much as 9% against the yen since the beginning of October to as much as 156.74, rising above the 156 mark last week for the first time since July and sparking the possibility Japanese authorities may again shore up the currency. Investors are waiting for Trump to name a Treasury secretary, one of the highest-profile cabinet posts overseeing the country's financial and economic policy. Some of Trump's other picks have generated questions about their qualifications and experience. The recent yen weakness to a three-month low has lifted expectations the Bank of Japan was likely to make a hawkish shift as the currency approaches levels that prompted an intervention in July. Comments this week from BoJ Governor Kazuo Ueda did not offer fresh signals on the central bank's leanings. Sterling weakened 0.17% to $1.266, giving back earlier gains. The pound had initially moved higher as data showed British inflation jumped more than expected last month to rise back above the Bank of England's 2% target and underlying price growth also gathered speed.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-lower-rates-dec-slow-122139893.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 4:21 AM","By Indradip Ghosh BENGALURU (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve will trim interest rates next month but make shallower cuts in 2025 than expected just a month ago due to the risk of higher inflation from President-elect Donald Trump's proposed policies, according to most economists in a Reuters poll. Prospects for a price resurgence based on his planned policies, including higher tariffs and tax reductions, led markets to nearly halve rate cut pricing to around 75 basis points by end-2025 over the past few weeks. Relentless economic strength, stubborn inflation and stock markets flirting with record highs have become barriers against hasty rate cuts. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week ""the economy is not sending any signals that we need to be in a hurry to lower rates."" Still, nearly 90% of economists, 94 of 106, in the Nov. 12-20 Reuters poll expected a 25bp cut in December, taking the fed funds rate to 4.25%-4.50%. Twelve expected no change, compared to only three in last month's survey. But market pricing showed there is now less than a 60% chance of a December cut. Until recently only a few were betting against such a move. ""We're still calling for a December cut. We think the data will behave. But you can see why markets kind of pricing another sort of coin flip...the economy is still very strong, inflation is still running above target,"" said Stephen Juneau, a U.S. economist at Bank of America. ""We'll see deregulation, easier fiscal policy, more protectionist trade policy and a tighter immigration stance. They all kind of pose an upside risk to inflation...the Fed is unlikely to cut as deeply as we previously considered because they're going to see inflation continue to be stuck above their target."" BofA recently upped its terminal fed funds rate forecast to 3.75%-4.00% from 3.00%-3.25%. The inflation outlook over the next two years was broadly upgraded from last month, poll medians showed, with personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation - the Fed's preferred gauge - predicted to mostly remain above the Fed's 2% target until at least 2027. An 85% majority, 57 of 67 respondents, said the risk of inflation resuming next year had risen. Most economists said Trump's proposed tariffs would be implemented early next year, which according to a strong majority, 44 of 51 will have a significant impact on the U.S. economy. Tariffs on imports from China could shave up to 1 percentage point from Chinese economic growth next year, a separate Reuters poll showed. ""A universal tariff... on all imported goods and even higher tariffs on Chinese goods are likely to lead to a rebound in inflation,"" said Philip Marey, senior U.S. strategist at Rabobank. ""Keep in mind unemployment is still relatively low and, especially with increased border security, it would not take long for wage pressures to creep back up. This only reinforces our long-held call the Fed's cutting cycle will be cut short in 2025."" The Fed will deliver a 25bps cut in the first three quarters but then be on hold, poll medians showed, putting the fed funds rate at 3.50%-3.75% by end-2025, 50bps higher than last month's projection. But there was no clear consensus. Nearly 30% of economists, 29 of 99, predicted the rate to be in a 3.75%-4.00% range or higher and 28 saw it at 3.50%-3.75%, higher than the Fed's 2.9% current estimate of the neutral rate, which neither stimulates nor restrains the economy. Among 72 common contributors in this and last month's poll, two-thirds, 48, lifted their end-2025 rate forecasts by around 50bps on average. The U.S. economy, which grew an annualized 2.8% last quarter, will expand 2.7% this year and 2% in 2025 and 2026, poll medians showed.

Like Monday, there's little news to guide market direction, with a reversal of some of the big moves from last week when world stocks suffered their worst week since the start of September again being the main driver of moves. The U.S. dollar is trading on the back foot again today, extending its retreat from a one-year peak versus major peers from last week. Treasury yields sagged to new lows in Tokyo, pulling away from Friday's high above 4.5%, a level last seen 5-1/2-months ago. The outlook for Federal Reserve easing seems to have returned as the market's main preoccupation, in the absence of highly anticipated announcements of Donald Trump's picks for the Treasury and trade portfolios. A run of robust U.S. data combined with expectations of faster inflation under Trump's higher-tariff, tighter-immigration policies have seen bets for a December rate cut pared to around 58% on CME FedWatch, from greater than 65% odds a week ago. Despite the relative news vacuum, AI darling Nvidia's earnings on Wednesday loom large as the event likely to set the tone for equity markets at least for the final half of the week, and possibly into year-end. There's little on the data docket in Europe today, which is headlined by final consumer inflation readings for October for the euro zone as a whole.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morning-bid-seeking-global-steer-214755919.html,"Mon, Nov 18, 2024, 1:47 PM","By Jamie McGeever (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets. Investors in Asia will likely take their cue from global dynamics and drivers given the dearth of local market-moving events on Tuesday, and if that's the case, the signs are reasonably encouraging. The rocky ride last week that saw a sharp reversal in stocks and risk appetite gave way to a much smoother start to this week on Monday. Broad measures of implied volatility, bond yields and the dollar all fell to varying degrees, paving the way for a rebound in riskier assets. There doesn't appear to be any fresh catalyst or impetus for the generally upbeat start to the week, so equally, one could argue that there's little guarantee Monday's global momentum will continue into Asia on Tuesday. But last week's selling was heavy, and many shorter-term speculative positions will have been cleaned out. The MSCI World and Nasdaq both posted their biggest losses in 10 weeks, and the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index had its worst week since June 2022. World stocks snapped a four-day losing streak on Monday while Asian stocks climbed for a second straight day, a surprisingly rare feat over the past six weeks. Investors continue to weigh up the outlook for U.S. interest rates in light of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks last Thursday that the central bank is in no rush to raise them, and last week's relatively strong U.S. economic data. There's a case to make that the 'hawkish' swing in the rates market's implied Fed pricing since Powell's comments - and indeed, over the last several weeks - has limited room to run. It wasn't that long ago talk of a possible 75 basis point rate cut in December was circulating and traders were betting on the fed funds rate ending next year around 2.75%. Now, even a 25 bps rate cut next month is by no means assured, and the implied end-2025 fed funds rate is not much below 4.00%. Perhaps the pendulum has swung a little too far. Investors may also be reluctant to take firm directional bets ahead of Nvidia's results on Wednesday. The semiconductor giant, at the vanguard of the global AI frenzy, is the world's most valuable company, and an earnings 'beat' or 'miss' will help set the global market tone for the rest of the week and probably year. The local calendar in Asia on Tuesday is light. The main highlight will be the Reserve Bank of Australia's minutes of its last policy meeting, where it kept the cash rate steady at 4.35% and signaled the need to remain ""vigilant"" to upside inflation risks. The RBA is only expected to start its easing cycle in May next year, and even then cut rates just half a percentage point by next December.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/rba-policy-effect-no-stronger-063000645.html,"Sun, Nov 17, 2024, 10:30 PM","(Bloomberg) -- Australia’s monetary policy effect is no more potent than those of other advanced economies, even though its households carry a large stock of variable-rate mortgage debt, a senior Reserve Bank official said. Most Read from Bloomberg Saudi Neom Gets $3 Billion Loan Guarantee From Italy Export Credit Agency Sace The Urban-Rural Divide Over Highway Expansion and Emissions Assistant Governor Christopher Kent said Monday that the central estimates from RBA models of how much GDP and inflation decline in response to an unanticipated increase in policy rates sit near estimates generated by models in the US, euro area, UK, Canada and Sweden. “This outcome reflects several features of the Australian mortgage market that collectively leave most borrowers with buffers that help them to manage through a period of higher interest rates,” Kent said in the text of a speech at the Australian National University in Canberra. “That has been the case through the recent episode, although many borrowers have struggled in the face of rising interest rates over the past two years or so, and household spending more broadly has weakened noticeably.” Australia’s households are among the world’s most heavily indebted as property prices defied gravity in recent years, particularly in the bellwether Sydney market. The RBA joined global counterparts in tightening in 2022 to counter surging inflation, though it opted not to raise as much as many central banks in an effort to shield the labor market. The RBA’s cash rate sits at a 13-year high of 4.35% and was about 1 percentage point below the peak rates in the US and New Zealand. One argument from economists for this difference had been that the rapid flow-through of hikes to floating-rate mortgages was likely to restrain Australian households from spending. Yet Kent said this wasn’t really the case. He said one way to judge the “overall potency” of policy is to compare its effects across different economies on aggregates like GDP and inflation using macroeconomic models. “Doing so for a range of models for several advanced economies suggests that the effect of monetary policy is neither faster nor more potent in Australia than elsewhere,” he said. Kent touched on forward guidance, noting that outside of the pandemic, the RBA has tended to provide it less frequently, in less explicit and more qualitative ways, and covering shorter terms than some other central banks. He pointed to a number of suggested reasons for Australia’s approach, including one from former Deputy Governor Guy Debelle, who argued that if the reaction function “is sufficiently clear, then forward guidance does not obviously have any large additional benefit and runs the risk of just adding noise or sowing confusion.” Kent said he thought it would be worth reviewing the RBA’s approach to forward guidance from time to time. This would include considering “other ways that the RBA might clarify the nature of its reaction function,” he said.

""It's concerning to me that we're recalibrating policy, but we haven't yet achieved our inflation goal,"" Bowman said at an event in West Palm Beach, Florida. The remark came in answer to one of several audience questions, a couple of which drew unusually personal responses from the generally reserved policymaker. Asked about the effect of changes to immigration policy on inflation and low-wage labor, Bowman urged a patient and cautious approach. Noting that her family's bank in Kansas primarily serves ranchers and farmers, she said it's very difficult to find people to work in agricultural jobs. ""We need people to work across this country and we need policies that will facilitate that,"" she said. President-elect Donald Trump, who nominated Bowman to her job six years ago during his first term, has promised to crack down on immigration and deport migrants after he takes office in January. Bowman, whose father was in the Air Force, teared up as she responded to a question about how growing up in a military family had shaped her leadership style, saying flexibility is key to coping with frequent childhood household moves. Flexibility is a frequent theme in Bowman's public remarks, and Wednesday was no different, as she emphasized the importance of optionality on rate decisions and the need to tailor banking regulation to size so that smaller community banks are not overburdened.

(Reuters) - U.S. inflation continues to ease, with wages and the job market cooling and excess price increases largely confined to housing, a situation in which it will likely remain appropriate to continue cutting interest rates, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook said on Wednesday. ""The totality of the data suggests that a disinflationary trajectory is still in place and that the labor market is gradually cooling,"" Cook said in comments prepared for delivery at the University of Virginia. ""In my view, it likely will be appropriate to move the policy rate toward a more neutral stance over time,"" Cook said, while adding that the ""magnitude and timing of rate cuts will depend on incoming data"" that could push the Fed to accelerate or pause cuts if, for example, the labor market starts to weaken dramatically or if inflation proves stickier than expected. Still, Cook said she envisions inflation falling to 2.2% next year and lower after that amid continued economic expansion and a labor market she described as ""solid."" ""If the labor market and inflation continue to progress in line with my forecast, it could well be appropriate to lower the level of policy restriction over time until we near the neutral rate of interest,"" said Cook, without specifying what she considers the neutral rate - where Fed policy neither stimulates nor restrains the economy - to be. The current benchmark rate is set in a range of 4.50% to 4.75% percent, and Cook said she felt the three-quarters-of-a-percentage-point lopped from it at the Fed's two prior meetings was ""a strong step toward removing policy restriction."" Cook did not explicitly endorse a rate cut at the Fed's next meeting on Dec. 17-18. Investors have grown less confident about whether the Fed will deliver another quarter-point at that meeting, with the odds attached to that slipping since the election of former president Donald Trump to a second term introduced the possibility of tariffs, tax cuts and immigration restrictions that could change the direction of growth, employment and inflation in uncertain ways. Current odds on CME Group's Fed Watch tool reflect about a 55%-to-45% split modestly in favor of another cut.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/feds-outline-necessary-steps-colorado-030221932.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 7:02 PM","LAS VEGAS (AP) — Federal water officials made public on Wednesday what they called “necessary steps” for seven states and multiple tribes that use Colorado River water and hydropower to meet an August 2026 deadline for deciding how to manage the waterway in the future. “Today we show our collective work,” Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Camille Calimlim Touton said as she outlined four proposals for action and one “no action” alternative that she and Biden's government will leave for the incoming Trump Administration — with formal environmental assessments still to come and just 20 months to act. The announcement offered no recommendation or decision about how to divvy up water from the river, which provides electricity to millions of homes and businesses, irrigates vast stretches of desert farmland and reaches kitchen faucets in cities including Denver, Salt Lake City, Albuquerque, Las Vegas, Phoenix and Los Angeles. Instead it provided a bullet-point sample of elements from competing proposals submitted last March by three key river stakeholders: Upper Basin states Colorado, Utah, New Mexico and Wyoming, where most of the water originates; Lower Basin states California, Arizona and Nevada, which rely most on water captured by dams at lakes Powell and Mead; and more than two dozen Native American tribes with rights to river water. “They’re not going to take the any of the proposals,” said Sarah Porter, director of the Kyl Center for Water Policy at Arizona State University. “The federal government put the components together in a different way ... and modeled them to provide near-maximum flexibility for negotiations to continue.” One alternative would have the government act to “protect critical infrastructure” including dams and oversee how much river water is delivered, relying on existing agreements during periods when demand outstrips supply. “But there would be no new delivery and storage mechanisms,” the announcement said. A second option would add delivery and storage for Lake Powell and Lake Mead, along with “federal and non-federal storage” to boost system sustainability and flexibility “through a new approach to distributing” water during shortages. The third, dubbed “cooperative conservation,” cited a proposal from advocates aimed at managing and gauging water releases from Lake Powell amid “shared contributions to sustain system integrity."" And a fourth, hybrid proposal includes parts of Upper and Lower Basin and Tribal Nations plans, the announcement said. It would add delivery and storage for Powell and Mead, encourage conservation and agreements for water use among customers and “afford the Tribal and non-Tribal entities the same ability to use these mechanisms.” The “no action” option does not meet the purpose of study but was included because it is required under the National Environmental Policy Act, the announcement said. In 2026, legal agreements that apportion the river will expire. That means that amid the effects of climate change and more than 20 years of drought, river stakeholders and the federal government have just months to agree what to do. “We still have a pretty wide gap between us,” Tom Buschatzke, Arizona’s main negotiator on the Colorado River, said in a conference call with reporters. He referred to positions of Upper Basin and Lower Basin states. Tribes including the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona have also been flexing their long-held water rights. Buschatzke said he saw “some really positive elements” in the alternatives but needed time to review them in detail. “I think anything that could be done to move things forward on a faster track is a good thing,” he said. Democratic U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper of Colorado said in a statement the alternatives “underscore how serious a situation we’re facing on the Colorado River.” “The only path forward is a collaborative, seven-state plan to solve the Colorado River crisis without taking this to court,” he said. ""Otherwise, we’ll watch the river run dry while we sue each other.” Wednesday’s announcement came two weeks after Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris lost the election to Republican former President Donald Trump, and two weeks ahead of a key meeting of the involved parties at Colorado River Water Users Association meetings in Las Vegas. Kyle Roerink, executive director of the Great Basin Water Network advocacy group, said “snapshots” offered in the announcement “underscore the uncertainty that is swirling around future river management as a new administration prepares to take office.” “The river needs basin-wide curtailments, agreements to make tribes whole, a moratorium on new dams and diversions, commitments for endangered species and new thinking about outdated infrastructure,” he said. Buschatzke declined to speculate about whether Trump administration officials will pick up where Biden's leaves off. But Porter, at the Kyl Center, said the announcement “shows an expectation of continuity.” “The leadership is going to change, but there are a lot of people who have been working on this for a long time who will still be involved in the negotiations and modeling,” she said. ___ Associated Press writer Amy Taxin in Santa Ana, California, contributed.","LAS (AP) Federal water officials made public Wednesday what called steps” for seven states and multiple tribes that Colorado River water and to an August 2026 deadline deciding manage the waterway in the we work,” of Reclamation Commissioner Camille Touton said as four proposals for action and one “no alternative that and government leave for the Administration — environmental assessments come and just 20 months The announcement no recommendation or decision about how to divvy water from the river, which provides to millions of homes and irrigates vast stretches of desert farmland and reaches kitchen faucets including Denver, Salt Albuquerque, Las Vegas, Phoenix and Los Angeles.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-gains-report-trumps-team-135544123.html,"Mon, Nov 18, 2024, 5:55 AM","By Akash Sriram (Reuters) - Tesla shares rose nearly 7% in trading before the bell on Monday after Bloomberg News reported that President-elect Donald Trump's transition team was planning to set up federal regulations for autonomous vehicles. The report comes days after Trump named the automaker's CEO, Elon Musk, as a co-head of the incoming administration's government efficiency department. Last month, Musk criticized the state-by-state approval process, required for self-driving vehicles, as ""incredibly painful"", weeks after unveiling a two-seat ""Cybercab"" robotaxi without a steering wheel and foot pedals, set to go into production in 2026. Trump's team is looking for policy leaders for the transport department to develop a federal regulatory framework, the report said, citing people familiar with the matter. ""A unified federal regulation could streamline this (approval process), allowing Tesla to push forward more rapidly with FSD testing,"" said Mamta Valechha, analyst at Quilter Cheviot. However, the regulation is not the primary barrier holding Tesla back at the moment, it's the company's Full Self-Driving (FSD) driver assistance technology that is still not fully autonomous and requires driver supervision. The FSD technology, which has been in development for more than four years, is also under a U.S. auto safety body investigation, after four reported collisions involving Tesla vehicles equipped with the software, including a 2023 fatal crash.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-trader-faces-lawsuit-over-050100553.html,"Mon, Nov 18, 2024, 3:07 AM","(Bloomberg) -- The energy trader seeking to buy UK gas assets from Shell Plc and Exxon Mobil Corp. was sued over allegations that he diverted money from an Iranian petrochemical company that was later banned from doing business in the US. Most Read from Bloomberg In Cleveland, a Forgotten Streetcar Bridge Gets a Long-Awaited Lift Amtrak Wins $300 Million to Fix Its Unreliable NJ-to-NYC Service A Bug’s Eye View of Mexico City’s Modernist Architecture Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees NYC Congestion Pricing Plan With $9 Toll to Start in January Francesco Mazzagatti is accused in a London lawsuit of profiting from an indirect ownership of Mehr Petrochemical Co., an Iranian maker of plastic resin. The US Treasury said last year that Mehr was at the heart of a vast “shadow banking network” that helped other companies continue to do business on behalf of the Iranian regime. The London lawsuit was filed in August by Alliance Petrochemical Investment, a Singaporean company that owns a controlling stake in Mehr. It accuses Mazzagatti of distributing the Iranian company’s products and secretly retaining his stake even after the company was sanctioned by US authorities last year. Mazzagatti denies the allegations and said that he never controlled Mehr, and calls the complaint part of a “vexatious campaign” by Arshiya Jahanpour, a former business partner who he says actually runs API. “Mr. Mazzagatti is not subject to any inquiry or scrutiny as a result of any dealings with Mehr,” his spokesperson said in an email. The Financial Times reported details of the lawsuit earlier. Mazzagatti’s Viaro Energy Ltd. is seeking regulatory approval for a set of deals with Shell and Exxon off the English coast that the company said would give it control of about 5% of the UK’s total gas output. The acquisition, if approved, would hand Viaro ownership of the “backbone of the UK’s energy production and security,” the company said when the deal was announced in July. The Shell and Exxon transactions, which include 11 offshore facilities, are subject to approval from the UK’s North Sea Transition Authority. The NSTA can consider the “fitness” of a licensee as part of that process. Mazzagatti says he has been “regularly communicating” with the regulator. Shell said the deal is expected to complete in 2025. The London lawsuit focuses on allegations that Mazzagatti effectively ran API, saying he directed the company even after stepping down from the board in September 2020. He “dealt” with Mehr on the basis that he remained CEO of API, the suit says. $143 Million API is suing for $143 million, plus damages, saying that Mazzagatti diverted money from the sale of Mehr products to a separate corporate vehicle he set up in the UAE. Mazzagatti is accused of misconduct through at least 2021. At a meeting that year, he produced a faked bank document bearing a false account balance, according to the filing. The suit also separately accuses him of profiting from forged signatures. “Mr. Mazzagatti continued to act as CEO, the board continued to be accustomed to acting at his direction, and the management of the company acted at his direction,” the current directors of API said in the lawsuit. The two sides disagree about a wide range of issues, including whether Mazzagatti ever served as CEO of API. Mazzagatti says he was simply a board director. Mazzagatti’s lawyers said that Jahanpour, a onetime close friend, actually ran the company and that Mazzagatti had always intended to “divest himself of the shareholding in API before the sanctions took effect.” Milan Case Mazzagatti separately faces a Milan criminal trial, where he is one of about a half dozen defendants facing charges related to a corruption case that has been dragging on for months. In a narrow part of the case, Mazzagatti is accused of using proceeds from an allegedly fraudulent deal with Eni SpA to buy the stake in API. Other Italian criminal charges relating to the attempted delivery of oil from Iran were dismissed by a judge. Mazzagatti denies the allegations and Viaro said in July that the company expects the rest of case against him to be dropped. Mehr was hit with the US restrictions in March 2023, in a move blocking any US dealings with the firm. According to the Office of Foreign Assets Control, any foreign financial institution that knowingly facilitates transactions with the company could also find itself subject to enforcement action. OFAC said Mehr’s products were marketed through a web of companies that generated billions of dollars for the Iranian government. The Mehr network helped Iran’s Persian Gulf Petrochemical Industry Commercial Co. market millions of dollars of high-density polyethylene produced by Mehr to third-party buyers for delivery to Turkey and Asia, according to the regulator. API used its lawsuit to lay out how Mazzagatti allegedly acquired the Mehr stake and raised questions about whether he tried to conceal it after the US sanctions were imposed. Mazzagatti says he never intended to keep his stake in API after buying it through a Hong Kong company in July 2018 and that he transferred 50% to a Jahanpour family firm a few months later. Five days after the sanctions, Mazzagatti formally transferred his stake in the Hong Kong company that owned the remaining 50% of API, called Petrochemicals Industries Ltd., also known as PIL. The sale went to a company in the United Arab Emirates called Sonic Investment Ltd., which is owned by a friend of Mazzagatti who lives in Dubai. According to API, Mazzagatti had tried to transfer the shares to Sonic months earlier for a “nominal consideration.” “It is therefore to be inferred that PIL remains under the control and ultimate beneficial ownership of Mr. Mazzagatti,” API said in the lawsuit. Mazzagatti’s friend, Najla Baccouche, said that she and her husband are involved in commodities trading and had been attempting to acquire PIL and Mehr before the sanctions. In an email to Bloomberg, she said that she hasn’t been able to pay Mazzagatti because she has “been unable to gain access to API’s profits.” “None of us expected the matter to escalate to the degree that it has, creating issues for everyone involved,” Baccouche said. --With assistance from Anthony Di Paola.

Here’s What Could Kill It Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting Should US inflation move closer to 3% in about one a half years from now, Trump may be inclined to nominate a Federal Reserve chairman who would accommodate the higher target and free him to cut interest rates, he said at Hong Kong’s third annual Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit. “There is a desire for cutting interest rates,” he added. “But if the inflation rate holds up, then that can preclude cutting rates, which I think sets up an interesting situation 18 months from now” when current Chair Jerome Powell’s term expires. Prince is joining peers who have warned investors to brace for higher inflation under a second Trump presidency, with its promises of pro-business and pro-growth policies adding pressure on prices and constraining labor force expansion. “Investors should still consider putting their money in the assets with strong inflation protection,” John Studzinski, vice chairman and managing director of Pacific Investment Management Co., said separately at the Forbes CEO Conference in Bangkok. “Inflation won’t go away, while proposed tariffs by the US will affect the prices. Geopolitical risk in the Middle East is also the main risk for supply chain and logistical costs,” Studzinski said. Trump has criticized Powell, who has said that he wouldn’t leave his post if asked to resign by Trump. Powell said in a briefing earlier this month that any attempt to demote him or any other Fed governor in a leadership position was “not permitted under the law.” The Fed chair has said the recent performance of the US economy has been “remarkably good” and has not sent any signals that policymakers should be in a hurry to lower rates. Monetary policy could face headwinds next year if Trump fulfills his campaign promises to cut taxes, restrain immigration and deploy tariffs. Trump’s policies would likely create an economic scenario of higher nominal growth, with spending staying higher and the yield curve trending steeper, Prince said. Household balance sheets are in “pretty good shape,” helped by prior decades of deleveraging, he said, adding that solid wages mean the spending has been largely financed by income, not credit. Combining that with fiscal stimulation, investors may not get the real interest rate cuts they were looking for before. That environment is more favorable for equities, as companies with pricing power can turn that nominal spending into nominal earnings growth, Prince said. The challenge in the equity market is that investors have not only priced in the best decade for corporate earnings in the past 10 years, but have fully factored in the probability of it happening again, Prince added.

The relatively low use and inability to contain rates is in part because the program targets only a part of the broader repo market. SRF operates in uncleared client-to-dealer tri-party transactions, one of three segments in the market, Roberto Perli, manager of the System Open Market Account at the New York Fed, said last week. The narrow focus excludes the portions of the market where dealers redistribute cash raised in the so-called tri-party market, in particular the segments most affected by balance-sheet capacity, leaving those portions to self-correct during periods of instability, according to Barclays strategist Joseph Abate. “The Fed might consider modifications to the SRF to ensure that funding can be redistributed from dealers to their clients,” Abate wrote. “In the absence of any discussion of changes to the SRF, it seems that the population of this ‘acronym-riddled island’ might be on its own so long as repo pressure is concentrated” in dealer-to-client (delivery-versus payment, or DVP) segment rather than uncleared tri-party market, he said. Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan said last month policymakers could consider centrally clearing the SRF, which would reduce counterparties’ cost of intermediating funding to the broader market. That has the potential to boost usage and improve market functioning. The focus on the SRF comes at a critical moment given that funding markets have grown more volatile beyond the typical spikes seen at the ends of months and quarters, when banks shore up their balance sheets for regulatory purposes by reigning in repo activity. Trading in overnight repo for the year-end turn — Dec. 31 to Jan. 2 — touched 5.50% last week. During the market turmoil in September 2019 and March 2020, shocks first emerged in DVP, where dealers’ clients struggled to raise financing. When costs became too expensive, they were forced to sell off positions and led to a pile-up of securities on balance sheets that reduced intermediation capacity. For now, bank reserves remain abundant and pressures in the repo market don’t appear to be close to the point they would start affecting the Fed’s benchmark rate, which means there’s still room for policymakers to continue shrinking the balance sheet, a process known as quantitative tightening. “All in all, outside of a sloppy September quarter-end, there is nothing to see in money markets,” Abate said. “Smooth seas with occasional whitecaps prevail.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Jaylen Brown Is Taking On Nike With $200 Sneakers Trump’s Impossible Task: Delivering for the Working Class and Billionaires Wall Street Is Too Pumped About Trump to Worry About His Policies Why Tech Billionaires Love the Author of Jurassic Park Democrats Let MAGA Co-Opt the Healthy Food Movement ©2024 Bloomberg L.P.","(Bloomberg) Overnight markets may be own during the next of key backstop is to the entire space unless made, according to Plc.

""Declines in excess demand pushed inflation down almost three-quarters of a percentage point over the past two years,"" San Francisco Fed economists Regis Barnichon and Adam Hale Shapiro wrote in the regional Fed bank's latest Economic Letter. ""However, elevated demand continued to contribute 0.3 to 0.4 percentage point to inflation as of September 2024."" The finding, based on an analysis of the relationship between inflation and labor market heat as measured by the ratio of job openings to job seekers, could help inform Fed policymakers as they weigh how much further and at what pace to reduce short-term borrowing costs. The U.S. central bank began lowering its policy rate in September in response to a slowdown in inflation and cooling of the job market. After a second rate cut earlier this month, the rate now sits in the 4.50%-4.75% range. U.S. central bankers believe that level is high enough to keep the brakes on the economy, but there is broad internal disagreement over how restrictive the rate is, and therefore about when and how much to cut it further. Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who has followed the sharp decline in the job-openings to job-seeker ratio closely, has said he believes labor demand is now in rough balance with supply and that the job market is no longer a source of significant inflationary pressures. The San Francisco Fed research suggests the job market continues to be a source of inflation, which Powell estimates was 2.3% in October by the Fed's targeted measure, and 2.8% by a measure stripping out food and energy that the Fed uses to gauge underlying inflationary pressures.

Crude also tracked equity markets higher, and a weaker dollar made raw materials priced in the currency more attractive. Brent also rose, settling above $73 a barrel. Meanwhile, the two nearest futures for West Texas Intermediate crude flipped into a bearish contango structure — where front-month contracts are cheaper than those further along — for the first time since February. The so-called prompt spread’s switch into a discount may be seen as a signal that supplies are outstripping near-term demand. But moves by traders who are bullish on crude may also have contributed to the prompt spread’s slip into contango. Those investors have been maintaining their bets on rising prices by selling December contracts, which are set to expire on Wednesday, and purchasing later-dated futures. “It is rare for spot prices to be up almost 3% at the same time that the curve is under pressure and threatening to switch to contango,” said Robert Yawger, director of the energy futures division at Mizuho Securities USA. “However, it is more likely to happen when speculators scramble to spread out of their position ahead of expiration, selling at the front of the curve and buying further out.” Speculation that an emboldened Ukraine may put Russian energy assets at risk and increase the likelihood of direct involvement from the US and North Korea is reducing the urgency to sell as well, said Rebecca Babin, senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth Group. Also supporting prices on Monday were reports the Chevron-led Tengiz venture in Kazakhstan cut daily oil production by as much as 30% this month amid maintenance. A dearth of expected inventory builds in recent US government data and the potential for stricter sanctions on Iran also added to tailwinds. Crude has swung between gains and losses in recent weeks, with hostilities in the Middle East at times raising fears of disruptions to supply. At the same time, a stronger greenback has pressured prices, with the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rallying to the highest in more than a year last week.

The structural driver of the forecast is higher demand from central banks, while a cyclical lift would come from flows to exchange-traded funds as the Federal Reserve cuts, they said. Gold has staged a powerful rally this year — hitting successive records — before pulling back in the immediate aftermath of Trump’s White House win, which boosted the dollar. The commodity’s advance has been underpinned by increased official-sector buying, and the Fed’s pivot to easier policy. Goldman said a Trump administration may also aid bullion. An unprecedented escalation of trade tensions could revive speculative positioning in gold, they said. In addition, rising concerns over US fiscal sustainability may also aid prices, they added, noting that central banks — especially those holding large US Treasury reserves — may opt to buy more of the precious metal. Spot gold was last at about $2,584 an ounce, having peaked above $2,790 last month. In other outlooks, Brent crude was seen trading between $70 and $85 a barrel next year, although there’s near-term upside risk if the Trump administration clamps down on flows from Iran, they said. Base metals were favored over ferrous, and European gas faced upside risks in the short term from the weather, they said. “The new US administration further raises the risks to Iran supply,” the analysts said, citing scope for potentially tighter enforcement of sanctions in a maximum-pressure campaign. “A potential strengthening in US support to Israel may also increase the probability of disruptions to Iran’s oil assets.” For farm goods, Goldman weighed the potential fallout from possible tit-for-trade trade measures between Washington and Beijing during Trump’s tenure. “Higher China tariffs on US agricultural goods and meat could reduce demand for US exports,” the analysts said. “Given insufficient alternative export markets, rebalancing the US market would require lower US soybean/corn/meat prices.” (Adds comment on possible agricultural tariffs in final paragraph) Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Elon Musk Has a New Project to Run: Trump’s Government North Dakota Wants Your Carbon, But Not Your Climate Science Oh, the Irony.

Of the total, 2,900 jobs would be lost in Germany, 800 in Britain and 300 in other European Union countries. Ford has 28,000 employees in Europe, and 174,000 worldwide. “The global auto industry continues to be in a period of significant disruption as it shifts to electrified mobility,” the company said in a statement. “The transformation is particularly intense in Europe where automakers face significant competitive and economic headwinds while also tackling a misalignment between CO2 regulations and consumer demand for electrified vehicles,” the statement said. In Europe, automakers must sell enough electric vehicles to meet new, lower limits for fleet average carbon dioxide emissions in 2025, and face a longer term 2035 EU goal of reducing emissions to zero, which would mean the elimination of most vehicles with internal combustion engines. EV sales however have lagged as consumers weary of inflation have held back on spending and after major car market Germany dropped government purchase incentives for EVs. Electric vehicles sales fell by 5.8% in the first nine months of the year in an overall shrinking market for cars. Carmakers are also facing increasing competition from Chinese-made electric vehicles. The company said that it would also reduce working time for workers at its Cologne, Germany, plant where it makes the Capri and Explorer electric vehicles. Ford sales fell 15.3% in the first nine months of the year compared to the same period last year, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. The company's market share shrank to 3% from 3.5% The Dearborn, Michigan, headquartered automaker saw companywide net profit fall by 26% to $892 million in the third quarter as it took $1 billion in accounting charges to write down assets for a canceled three-row electric SUV. The company cited higher warranty and other costs. Ford is an established brand in Europe and will mark its 100th anniversary of doing business in Germany next year. Its main plant in Cologne started production in 1931; the groundbreaking was attended by Henry Ford and then-Mayor Konrad Adenauer, later Germany’s chancellor. Ford is not alone in suffering from headwinds. Volkswagen has said it is contemplating closing as many as three of its German plants, according to its chief employee representative. European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association has called for a speedier review of lower C02 limits slated for 2026. Ford said company vice chairman and CFO John Lawler had written a letter to the German government reiterating Ford's commitment to climate goals but urging action to improve market conditions and ensuring the industry’s future success. ""What we lack in Europe and Germany is an unmistakable, clear policy agenda to advance e-mobility, such as public investments in charging infrastructure, meaningful incentives to help consumers make the shift to electrified vehicles, improving cost competitiveness for manufacturers, and greater flexibility in meeting CO2 compliance targets,” Lawler said.","FRANKFURT, Germany — Motor Co. says it will by in Europe the U.K. by the end of 2027, citing headwinds from the economy and pressure from competition and weaker expected sales electric cars. said Wednesday of the cuts would Germany and would be in consultation employee representatives. 2,900 jobs would Germany, 800 Britain 300 Union countries.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medicare-part-b-getting-more-152456768.html,"Tue, Nov 19, 2024, 7:24 AM","Medicare Part B is one of the cornerstones of Medicare’s health insurance, covering many common health expenses—doctor visits, outpatient care, preventive services, and certain medical equipment and home health services. Each year, changes to the Medicare Part B premium, deductible, and copays are determined based on stipulations of the Social Security Act, according to a news release from CMS. In 2025, the standard monthly premium for Medicare Part B will increase to $185, an increase of $10.30 per month from $174.70 in 2024, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced on November 8. Approximately 8% of Medicare Part B beneficiaries will pay more than the standard premium as high earners, according to CMS. In 2025, Part B beneficiaries with annual individual incomes greater than $106,000 will pay more than the standard premium, which will vary depending on their income. The annual deductible for all Medicare Part B beneficiaries will increase to $257 in 2025, or an additional $17 from the 2024 annual deductible of $240. The increase for the 2025 Part B standard premium and deductible “is mainly due to projected price changes and assumed utilization increases that are consistent with historical experience,” according to the same news release. Most Medicare Part B premiums are deducted automatically from Social Security benefit payments. The 2025 increase in Medicare premiums outpaces inflation, which rose to an annual rate of 3.2% in October, and the increase in Social Security benefits of 2.5%, or approximately $50 per month starting in January. CMS also announced increases to Medicare Part A pricing in 2025. Medicare Part A covers hospital stays, and at times covers home health care, skilled facility care, and hospice care. While 99% of Medicare Part A beneficiaries pay no premium (if they meet the requirements of having at least 40 quarters of Medicare-covered employment), deductibles and copays still apply. These are the 2025 Medicare Part A pricing changes: The inpatient hospital deductible will be $1,676 in 2025, an increase of $44 from $1,632 in 2024. The deductible covers the beneficiaries’ portion of costs for the first 60 days of Medicare-covered inpatient hospital care during the benefit period. The copay for the 61st through 90th day of hospitalization will be $419 per day ($408 in 2024) during a benefit period, and $838 per day for lifetime reserve days ($816 in 2024). The daily copay for days 21 through 100 of extended care services in a benefit period in skilled nursing facilities will be $209.50 in 2025 ($204.00 in 2024). For the 1% of Part A beneficiaries who pay the full premium, the amount will be $518 a month in 2025, a $13 increase from 2024. CMS also announced that similar to Part B, high-income individuals will pay more for Medicare Part D (prescription drug coverage) monthly premiums in 2025. Beneficiaries who file individual tax returns with modified adjusted gross income of $106,000 or higher will pay an additional $13.70 to $85.80 monthly, depending on their income. Beneficiaries who are married and lived with their spouses at any time during the year, but file separate tax returns from their spouses with modified adjusted gross income, with incomes of $106,000 or higher will pay an additional $78.60 to $85.80 per month, depending on their income.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cook-says-fed-cut-rates-160000470.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 8:00 AM","(Bloomberg) -- Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook said it will likely be appropriate for the central bank to cut interest rates toward a more neutral stance over time, citing inflation progress and a solid labor market. Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting NYC Mayor Adams Names Jessica Tisch to Lead Police Head Amid Probes Cook described the risks to the central bank’s employment and inflation goals as “roughly in balance.” She said she sees the direction of interest rates as downward, but that the “magnitude and timing” of reductions will depend on incoming data and the economic outlook. “It likely will be appropriate to move the policy rate toward a more neutral stance over time,” Cook said in prepared remarks Wednesday at an event at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. A neutral policy position is one that neither stimulates nor restricts economic activity. After lowering interest rates at each of their last two meetings, Fed officials will issue their next policy decision following their gathering Dec. 17-18. Investors have dialed back expectations for another rate reduction at that meeting, given firm inflation data and a string of comments from policymakers arguing the Fed should proceed with future adjustments with caution. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week that the economy is not sending signals that officials need to be in a hurry to reduce rates. Cook said Wednesday there had been “significant progress” on disinflation, but that elevated core inflation — which strips out the volatile categories of food and energy — “suggests that we have further to go before credibly achieving our inflation target of 2%.” “Although most price indicators suggest that progress is ongoing, I anticipate bumps along the road,” she said. She said she estimates both overall and core inflation falling to 2.2% next year, with her confidence in continued disinflation further reinforced by a moderation in wage growth. Labor Market Meanwhile, Cook described the jobs landscape as solid. The labor market has cooled during 2024, with a decline in job openings and an uptick in unemployment. Regardless, levels of joblessness and layoffs remain low overall. “The labor market is in a good position — with the supply and demand for workers being roughly in balance — such that it is no longer a source of inflationary pressure in the economy,” Cook said. She added downside risks to employment have “diminished somewhat” recently. Still, she said national job growth is “perhaps not quite strong enough to keep unemployment at the current low rate.” Cook also laid out potential scenarios for the Fed’s policy path moving forward. She said if the the labor market and inflation continue to progress in line with her forecasts, it could be appropriate to lower rates “over time until we near the neutral rate of interest.” “However, if inflation progress slows and the labor market remains solid, I could see a scenario where we pause along the downward path,” she said. “Alternatively, should the labor market weaken in a substantial way, it could be appropriate to ease policy more quickly.” Fed officials will release fresh projections for the economy and the path for interest rates following their December meeting.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-traders-price-trump-foreign-100000561.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 2:00 AM","(Bloomberg) -- Oil’s longstanding geopolitical risk premium has evaporated as traders interpret Donald Trump’s foreign policy agenda as bearish for oil demand — and prices. Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting NY Congestion Pricing Survived a Pause. Here’s What Could Kill It Since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, oil futures have routinely traded above their so-called fair value, elevated by the threat of war-related supply disruptions. But that risk premium has faded, even amid persistent conflict in the Middle East and expectations that the president-elect will try to curb crude exports from major producer Iran. In the options market, where traders often hedge against sudden price moves, the premium for bullish call options over bearish put options in Brent has disappeared completely, after activity had earlier in the year reached a record. At the same time, a BloombergNEF gauge shows oil futures erasing all risk premium from the start of 2024. The war premium for Brent, which is currently trading at near $73 a barrel, is at a discount of roughly $2, the first time it’s gone negative since 2021. That’s in part because oil investors are pricing in Trump’s foreign policy approach as bearish. Of 10 traders surveyed by Bloomberg, eight said that Trump’s proposals will limit price increases, with some suggesting a trade war with China will erode demand and potentially offset any new sanctions on Iran. The absence of a risk premium is the latest indication that traders see little upside in the crude market, even with Trump in office. Oil futures have traded listlessly since the election, trapped in a roughly $5 range with investors increasingly reluctant to bet on hypothetical supply outages. That may prove positive for Trump, with lower crude prices setting the stage for cheaper gasoline at the pump. Despite the possibility of escalation in the Middle East, traders are positioning for an oversupplied oil market capable of blunting any disruptions, thanks to record US shale production and ample OPEC+ spare capacity. These backstops didn’t exist in 2022, when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine shot prices to over $120 a barrel, said Rory Johnston, founder of oil consultancy CommodityContext. By Johnston’s estimations, a risk premium hasn’t been visible in the market since April. Bearish market participants also might be working off of memories of a risk-averse Trump who opts for economic pressure over military action, according Gregory Brew, a geopolitical analyst at the Eurasia Group. He cited a 2020 Iranian attack on a US base in northern Iraq in response to Qasem Soleimani’s assassination, which Trump chose not to escalate despite a chorus of hawkish advisors. That foreshadows a government that emboldens Israel in its campaign against Iranian proxies, without supporting a direct strike, Brew said. Already, Iran has shown an unwillingness to clash with the incoming administration, agreeing to stop producing uranium enriched close to the level required for nuclear weapons. READ: Iran Loath to Be Drawn Into New Clash With US as Trump Returns Trump in his first term led the US in a maximum pressure campaign that significantly reduced the Islamic Republic’s exports. Investors believe he’ll attempt to target those flows again. Yet such actions may have a clipped impact on crude prices with traders increasingly unconvinced that sanctions have teeth. When the US government last re-upped sanctions against Iranian oil in October, the commodity sagged by more than $5 a barrel in the next week. “The consensus is that the US may have some success pushing down some Iran oil exports, but not all, and not in short order,” Brew said. Even so, the potential loss of up to 1 million barrels a day of Iranian crude “may not offset bearish signals to the extent that you have a higher price environment.” Still, analysts warn that there are risks of going into a Trump presidency too bearish. “Being short at the very front of the market will be difficult given the attendant risk and accompanying price gyrations, which were a market hallmark of the first Trump administration,” said John Kilduff, co-founder of Again Capital LLC. He anticipates long put spreads to be a popular trade as traders hedge against the likelihood of a protracted sell-off. --With assistance from Pol Lezcano and Yongchang Chin.

In a letter to Fed Chair Jerome Powell and the central bank's regulatory chief, Michael Barr, Warren said the Fed must reject Wells Fargo reported appeal to have the punishment imposed in 2018 lifted until it ""can show that it can properly manage the risks associated with running a large bank."" Spokespeople for Wells Fargo and the Fed declined to comment on the letter, which was seen by Reuters. Bloomberg reported in September that Wells Fargo had sent a third-party review of its risk and control overhauls to the Fed in a bid to end the unprecedented cap imposed following the bank's long-running fake accounts scandal and other issues. Republican President-elect Donald Trump is set to overhaul bank regulation and slash burdensome rules, boosting analysts' expectations that the cap could be removed as early as next year and alarming many Democrats in favor of tough rules. A prominent Wall Street critic and one-time presidential candidate, Warren will next year become the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. Long a thorn in Wells Fargo's side, Warren cannot force the Fed's hand but her letter can pressure it to take a tough line and highlight the bank's missteps. Warren pointed to a number of regulatory actions against Wells Fargo since 2018, including in September when the Comptroller of the Currency dinged the bank for shortcomings in policing money laundering. The country's fourth-largest lender is still grappling with a class action lawsuit over its diversity hiring practices, she also noted. Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf has repeatedly said upgrading the bank's risk and control framework has been a top priority, and the bank has convinced regulators to terminate six regulatory consent orders since 2019. In response to Warren's request at a 2018 hearing, Powell committed that the Fed would put any decision to lift the asset cap to a vote of its Board of Governors.

Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amazon-elon-musks-spacex-challenge-222946924.html,"Mon, Nov 18, 2024, 2:29 PM","Attorneys for Amazon and Elon Musk’s SpaceX argued in a federal appeals court Monday that the National Labor Relations Board’s structure is unconstitutional, advancing a legal fight that may last into the Trump administration where Musk is expected to oversee bureaucratic cost-cutting. A panel of three judges at the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans heard separate oral arguments in the SpaceX and Amazon lawsuits, which the two companies initiated after the labor agency filed complaints against them in disputes about workers’ rights and union organizing. A ruling in favor of the companies could immensely diminish – or paralyze - the nearly century-old agency, which is tasked with enforcing labor laws and settling labor-related complaints workers lodge against their employers. The issue may eventually reach the U.S. Supreme Court, which has a conservative majority and has issued rulings curbing the power of government agencies, The three appellate judges who heard Monday's arguments questioned the legal maneuvering by Amazon and SpaceX to get their cases to the 5th Circuit, where jurists nominated by Republican presidents dominate the appeals court. A lawyer for the NLRB emphasized during the hearing that both companies filed their appeals after lower courts did not give rulings by requested deadlines. Michael E. Kenneally, an attorney for SpaceX, retorted that the government was “relying so much on the procedural objections” because of the alleged weakness of its legal argument, a claim that elicited some pushback from the panel. “That sounds to me like the argument ‘procedure doesn’t matter if I win on the merits,’” Judge James E. Graves Jr., an appointee of former President Barack Obama, said. SpaceX, Musk's space technology company, filed its lawsuit against the NLRB in January after the labor agency accused the company of unlawfully firing employees who wrote an open letter critical of Musk and of creating the impression worker activities were being surveilled. Among other claims, the company argued in its complaint that agency proceedings deprived it of the right to a trial by a jury. Musk, the world’s richest person, has become more influential in the past few months after pumping an estimated $200 million through his political action committee to help elect Donald Trump as president. After he was elected, Trump tapped Musk and former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a new efficiency commission focused on cutting costs across the federal government. Musk has said the new administration will have a “mandate to delete the mountain of choking regulations that do not serve the greater good.” Amazon's lawsuit against the NLRB is tied to the company’s objections to a union election that took place at a warehouse in New York City in April 2022. The retail giant has accused the agency of improperly interfering in that election, partly by bringing a lawsuit against the company to reinstate a fired organizer close to when voting began. The Amazon Labor Union ultimately won the election to represent workers, but Amazon has refused to come to the negotiating table. The company’s attorneys argued in the lawsuit that the NLRB board members who authorized the agency’s complaint later “acted as judges” by denying a review of Amazon's objections, which also came before them. Amazon's lawyers maintained the agency’s structure was unconstitutional because board members are shielded from removal by the U.S. president, among other things. In a statement issued before Monday's hearing, NLRB General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo said it was “nothing new for big companies to challenge the authority of the NLRB to enforce workers’ rights so as not to be held accountable for their violations"" of labor law.","Attorneys for and Elon Musk’s argued in federal appeals court that the National Labor Relations Board’s structure is advancing a legal fight that may the Trump administration where Musk is expected to oversee bureaucratic A panel three 5th U.S. Circuit Court Appeals New Orleans separate in the SpaceX and Amazon lawsuits, which the companies initiated labor agency filed complaints against them in disputes rights and union A ruling in the companies could diminish or paralyze - the century-old agency, is tasked with labor laws and settling labor-related workers lodge their The issue may reach the Supreme Court, which has majority has issued rulings curbing power of government agencies, The appellate judges heard Monday's arguments questioned legal maneuvering Amazon and SpaceX cases to the Circuit, nominated by Republican dominate the A lawyer the NLRB during the hearing that companies lower did give requested deadlines.

Nomura now expects the Fed to deliver only two 25-basis-point (bp) rate reductions at its March and June meetings in 2025, leaving the brokerage's Fed funds rate projection unchanged at 4.125% through next year. The Fed's benchmark overnight interest rate is currently in the 4.50%-4.75% range. It has cut rates by 75 bps in 2024. Other global brokerages, including Goldman Sachs and J.P.Morgan, anticipate a 25-bp cut from the central bank next month. Nomura expects the Fed to halt its tightening cycle next month after recent hawkish remarks from policymakers amid ongoing economic growth and the likelihood of further elevated inflation, adding to the central bank's indication that it is not in a hurry to lower rates. This follows the Fed's increasing hesitancy to cut rates as a major political shift is underway after Trump's presidential victory. Wall Street is trying to reconcile what it sees as further inflationary pressures in the coming year as the President-elect pushes for tax cuts, higher tariffs and a crackdown on immigration. ""We currently expect tariffs will drive realized inflation higher by the summer, and risks are skewed towards an earlier and more prolonged pause,"" Nomura said in a note dated Friday. Last week, data showed that U.S. consumer prices rose 2.6% in the 12 months through October, above the Fed's 2% goal but in-line with economists' expectations. Traders now see a 34.7% chance of the central bank pausing rate cuts in December, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool.

Bowman voted against the Fed’s half-point cut in September — the first such dissent by a Fed governor on the monetary policy committee in almost two decades — preferring a smaller move. She voted with her colleagues for a quarter-point reduction this month, which brought the benchmark lending rate to a range of 4.5% to 4.75%. Futures traders are pricing the chance of another cut next month at somewhat above 50%. Bowman’s remarks suggest she may not go along with that move if the labor market remains strong while inflation progress falters. “We have seen considerable progress in lowering inflation since early 2023, but progress seems to have stalled in recent months,” Bowman said in the text of her remarks. “We should also not rule out the risk that the policy rate may attain or even fall below its neutral level before we achieve our price stability goal.” She noted that the 12-month measure of core personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, “has moved sideways at around 2.7% since May.” Preliminary data suggests progress will also be limited in October, she said. Elsewhere in her remarks, Bowman was critical of the regulatory response to bank failures in early 2023 including the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank. “A crisis is not a regulatory blank check,” she said. “Promoting safety, soundness, and financial stability should not devolve into an exercise of regulatory allocation of credit — picking winners and losers — or promoting an ideological position through more open-ended processes like bank supervision and examination.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Jaylen Brown Is Taking On Nike With $200 Sneakers Trump and the Triumph of America’s New Elite Trump’s Impossible Task: Delivering for the Working Class and Billionaires Deep in the Jungle, Virus Hunters Are Working to Stop the Next Pandemic Companies With Immigrant Workforces Are Preparing for Raids ©2024 Bloomberg L.P.

The Boston Fed chief also said policy is well positioned for the Federal Open Market Committee to address the risks to both inflation and employment, reiterating rates are not on a preset path. “The policy adjustments made so far enable the FOMC to be careful and deliberate going forward, taking the time to holistically assess implications of the available data for the outlook and the associated balance of risks,” she said.

Several policymakers have since said they favor a careful approach to further rate adjustments, citing uncertainty about how much they will ultimately be able to lower borrowing costs. ‘Good Place’ Collins described the economy as in a “good place overall” and said inflation is on track to return to the Fed’s 2% target, although progress may be uneven. She noted resilient demand could put upward pressure on prices. The Fed official described the labor market as healthy but flagged job growth is becoming more concentrated in a few sectors. “Any further slowing in hiring would be undesirable,” Collins said.

Americans also became more pessimistic about their ability to tap credit in the future. “Reported rejection rates for credit cards, mortgages, auto loans, credit card limit extension applications and mortgage loan refinance applications all rose in 2024,” the New York Fed said in a statement. The findings showed reported rejection rates rose to 21% this year, from 20.1% in 2023. That’s well above the 17.6% seen before the pandemic. Borrowers with credit scores under 680 were especially likely to face rejection rates that were above pre-pandemic levels. The figures are from the New York Fed’s survey of consumer expectations credit access survey, which is conducted every four months and was most recently fielded in October. The average rejection rate for mortgage applications increased by 8.6 percentage points to 20.7% in 2024, more than double the 2019 rate. For mortgage refinances, the average rejection rate rose to a series high of 25.6%. And for auto loans, the rate rose to 11.4%, the highest since the start of the series in 2013. Borrowers don’t expect it will become easier to obtain credit in the near term and fewer people are planning to apply for loans over the next year, the study showed. The share of people who said they are likely to apply for at least one type of credit in the next year dropped to 23.1% in 2024, down from 25.9% in 2023. --With assistance from Alex Tanzi.

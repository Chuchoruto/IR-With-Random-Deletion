4,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-releases-teachers-guide-chatgpt-100011976.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 8:40 AM"," OpenAI envisions teachers using its AI-powered tools to create lesson plans and interactive tutorials for students. But some educators are wary of the technology — and its potential to go awry. Today, OpenAI released a free online course designed to help K-12 teachers learn how to bring ChatGPT, the company's AI chatbot platform, into their classrooms. Created in collaboration with the nonprofit organization Common Sense Media, with which OpenAI has an active partnership, the one-hour, nine-module program covers the basics of AI and its pedagogical applications. OpenAI says that it's already deployed the course in ""dozens"" of schools, including the Agua Fria School District in Arizona, the San Bernardino School District in California, and the charter school system Challenger Schools. Per the company's internal research, 98% of participants said the program offered new ideas or strategies that they could apply to their work. ""Schools across the country are grappling with new opportunities and challenges as AI reshapes education,"" Robbie Torney, senior director of AI programs at Common Sense Media, said in a statement. ""With this course, we are taking a proactive approach to support and educate teachers on the front lines and prepare for this transformation.” But some educators don't see the program as helpful — and think it could in fact mislead. Lance Warwick, a sports lecturer at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, is concerned resources like OpenAI's will normalize AI use among educators unaware of the tech's ethical implications. While OpenAI's course covers some of ChatGPT's limitations, like that it can't fairly grade students' work, Warwick found the modules on privacy and safety to be ""very limited"" — and contradictory. ""In the example prompts [OpenAI gives], one tells you to incorporate grades and feedback from past assignments, while another tells you to create a prompt for an activity to teach the Mexican Revolution,"" Warwick noted. ""In the next module on safety, it tells you to never input student data, and then talks about the bias inherent in generative AI and the issues with accuracy. I'm not sure those are compatible with the use cases."" Sin á Tres Souhaits, a visual artist and educator at The University of Arizona, says that he's found AI tools to be helpful in writing assignment guides and other supplementary course materials. But he also says he's concerned that OpenAI's program doesn't directly address how the company might exercise control over content teachers create using its services. ""If educators are creating courses and coursework on a program that gives the company the right to recreate and sell that data, that would destabilize a lot,"" Tres Souhaits told TechCrunch. ""It's unclear to me how OpenAI will use, package, or sell whatever is generated by their models.""lo In its ToS, OpenAI states that it doesn't sell user data, and that users of its services, including ChatGPT, own the outputs they generate ""to the extent permitted by applicable law."" Without additional assurances, however, Tres Souhaits isn't convinced that OpenAI won't quietly change its policies in the future. ""For me, AI is like crypto,"" Tres Souhaits said. ""It's new, so it offers a lot of possibility — but it's also so deregulated that I wonder how much I would trust any guarantee."" Late last year, the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) pushed for governments to regulate the use of AI in education, including implementing age limits for users and guardrails on data protection and user privacy. But little progress has been made on those fronts since — and on AI policy in general. Tres Souhaits also takes issue with the fact that OpenAI's program, which OpenAI markets as a guide to ""AI, generative AI, and ChatGPT,"" doesn't mention any AI tools besides OpenAI's own. ""It feels like this reinforces the idea that OpenAI is the AI company,"" he said. ""It's a smart idea for OpenAI as a business. But we already have a problem with these tech-opolies — companies that have an outsize influence because, as the tech was developed, they put themselves at the center of innovation and made themselves synonymous with the thing itself."" Josh Prieur, a classroom teacher-turned-product director at educational games company Prodigy Education, had a more upbeat take on OpenAI's educator outreach. Prieur argues that there are ""clear upsides"" for teachers if school systems adopt AI in a ""thoughtful"" and ""responsible"" way, and he believes that OpenAI's program is transparent about the risks. ""There remain concerns from teachers around using AI to plagiarize content and dehumanize the learning experience, and also risks around becoming overly reliant on AI,"" Preiur said. ""But education is often key to overcoming fears around the adoption of new technology in schools, while also ensuring the right safeguards are in place to ensure students are protected and teachers remain in full control."" OpenAI is aggressively going after the education market, which it sees as a key area of growth. In September, OpenAI hired former Coursera chief revenue officer Leah Belsky as its first GM of education, and chargefd her bringing OpenAI's products to more schools. And in the spring, the company launched ChatGPT Edu, a version of ChatGPT built for universities. According to Allied Market Research, the AI in education market could be worth $88.2 billion within the next decade. But growth is off to a sluggish start, in large part thanks to skeptical pedagogues. In a survey this year by the Pew Research Center, a quarter of public K-12 teachers said that using AI tools in education does more harm than good. A separate poll by the Rand Corporation and the Center on Reinventing Public Education found that just 18% of K-12 educators are using AI in their classrooms. Educational leaders have been similarly reluctant to try AI themselves, or introduce the technology to the educators they oversee. Per educational consulting firm EAB, few district superintendents view addressing AI as a ""very urgent"" need this year — particularly in light of pressing issues such as understaffing and chronic absenteeism. Mixed research on AI's educational impact hasn't helped convince the non-believers. University of Pennsylvania researchers found that Turkish high school students with access to ChatGPT did worse on a math test than students who didn’t have access. In a separate study, researchers observed that German students using ChatGPT were able to find research materials more easily, but tended to synthesize those materials less skillfully than their non-ChatGPT-using peers. As OpenAI writes in its guide, ChatGPT isn't a substitute for engagement with students. Some educators and schools may never be convinced it's a substitute for any step in the teaching process.

The rebrand, which includes a new logo, is slated to launch Dec. 2 during the Miami Art Week, when the company will unveil a new electric GT model. But Jaguar Land Rover, a unit of India’s Tata Motors Ltd., has been promoting it online. The Jaguar brand is in the middle of a transition to going all-electric. “Copy Nothing,” marketing materials read. “We're here to delete the ordinary. To go bold. To copy nothing.” The promotional video, posted on X and Instagram, shows models dressed in futuristic brightly colored outfits walking in an alien-like landscape. “Break Moulds,” copy reads. It drew ire online, with people complaining about the lack of a car and the confusing message. X owner Elon Musk wrote on X, “Do you sell cars?” People also complained about the new, stylized, logo. The “leaper” jaguar image has also been reimagined. Charles Taylor, marketing professor at the Villanova School of Business in Villanova, Pennsylvania, said the promotional video strikes the wrong tone for potential buyers, and said the company is making a mistake by not using the brand's heritage as an elegant British high-performance sports car in its marketing. “If they came back with a really good electric vehicle, they could build on their prior image as opposed to really throwing out the heritage of the brand and going in this kind of direction,” he said. “It’s hard to see how the market of people that would like that approach is large enough for them to thrive.” Rebranding is a common tactic for companies seeking to spark sales. Campbell Soup Co. on Wednesday officially changed its name to Campbell's Co., and companies like Airbnb and Instagram update their logos from time to time. But if they strike a wrong chord, the result can be disastrous. Past rebranding failures include Tropicana changing its logo in 2009 to omit its trademark orange — it soon changed it back. And Radio Shack rebranded to “The Shack” in 2008, alienating its core shoppers, before eventually filing for bankruptcy protection in 2015. Jaguar Land Rover, based in Whitney, Coventry, in the U.K., did not return a request for comment."," NEW YORK (AP) A promotional video for a rebrand of British luxury car brand is being criticized online for showing models in brightly colored outfits — and no The rebrand, which includes a new is slated to launch Dec. 2 during the Miami Art Week, when the company will unveil a new electric GT model.

6,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/owning-a-home-has-rarely-been-this-much-more-expensive-than-renting-155251484.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 7:52 AM"," On paper, owning a home is almost always more expensive than renting — about 14% more, on average, after factoring in expenses like insurance, taxes, and upkeep. But the difference has grown much more extreme in recent years as just about all homeownership costs have ballooned. How extreme? Exact cost estimates vary, but recently the premium for homeownership has been at least 35% over renting, a level that’s near historical highs and is likely to persist. “We’re well, well beyond what the typical historical difference is if you were to buy an entry-level home versus rent a starter home,” said Rick Palacios Jr., director of research at John Burns Research and Consulting. “I think that’s a big part of why you see the resale market in a recession.” Palacios’ firm has found factors like rising homeowners insurance premiums explain much of the growing gap. Higher mortgage rates don’t help either. Leaving other factors constant, it would take mortgage rates to be at 3.5% for the buying versus renting math to return to historical averages. Commercial real estate investment firm CBRE pegs the premium to buy versus own at about 35% earlier this year, with the dip in mortgage rates in the fall helping bring that level down from a record high of 52%. Their measure includes the cost of mortgage insurance that most lenders require, but doesn’t factor in expenses like homeowners insurance or upkeep. “If anything, what we present … is a very conservative approach, said Travis Deese, associate director for multifamily research. “It likely is a lot higher than that.” The differential might get a bit less extreme next year if mortgage rates slowly drop and rents creep up, CBRE found. But stubbornly high home prices will prevent the premium from moving too much. The company expects the premium to end 2025 at around 25%. Ownership dreams Buying versus renting is a fierce debate in personal finance circles, and both factions come armed with talking points. Buyers point to how they’re building equity and shielding themselves from the looming threat of rent increases. Renters tout their maintenance-free lifestyles and the ease of moving if they want to try living somewhere new. The choice is ultimately personal, and buying remains the long-term goal for the majority of Americans. But while home ownership costs have continued to move higher, renters have recently gotten a little bit of a break. Like home prices, rents are still markedly higher than pre-pandemic levels, but aggressive apartment construction has helped minimize further increases this year. Nationwide, median rents rose just 0.2% in October from a year earlier, according to Redfin, although areas with less construction, like the Northeast and Midwest, saw larger jumps. Brooke Merino, 26, knows the calculus. She works in sales, helping renters in the Denver area find apartments, and has recently seen some buildings offer discounted lease renewals. Her own rental, a two-bedroom home, costs her just over $2,500 a month for rent and utilities. And she recently closed on a $525,000, four-bedroom, two-bathroom house in Englewood, Colo. Her mortgage payment will be about $3,500. “I don’t mind renting, but I’m at the point where I want to buy and move forward,” Merino said. “It was just a matter of determining what I was comfortable with, and what I knew I could afford.” In all, Merino feels she got a deal: The home she bought had lingered on the market and saw several price reductions, and she locked in a sub-6% mortgage rate just before rates began rising again this fall. She’s looking forward to having more space and a large yard for her dog. Many prospective homeowners haven’t been so lucky. Average mortgage rates of around 7% are a bit lower than they were this time a year ago, but median home prices have been stubbornly stuck close to all-time highs. “The one-year outlook is for very little change in home prices, rents, and mortgage rates,” said Matt Vance, Americas head of multifamily research at CBRE. Fannie Mae, which surveys consumers monthly on their feelings about the housing market, found in October that a record high 36% of consumers say their next move will be to rent rather than buy. The rental preference has been growing slowly in recent years. Three years ago, 26% said they would be likely to rent. Savannah West, 28, opted to become a renter again after renovating a three-bedroom, two-bathroom fixer-upper she and her partner bought in Douglasville, Ga., in 2021 proved daunting. “It felt like a really sweet deal, but we were spending thousands of dollars almost every month on home improvement supplies,” West said. “We lived at Home Depot.” West, an editor at lifestyle website Home & Texture, was also growing tired of making the 30- to 40-minute drive from the suburbs to Atlanta for events. So over the summer, her family moved into a loft in the city, renting out their suburban home to cover their mortgage payment. She likes being able to walk to nearby restaurants and bars and takes her daughter to the city’s many activities. While renting suits her for now, she’s considering purchasing a condo in Atlanta in the future. Real estate agent Iain Phillips is generally a fan of buying, perhaps an unsurprising stance for someone in the business of selling homes. But he understands when his clients opt to continue renting, especially in expensive Orange County, Calif., where he works. Several first-time homebuyers he’s working with will likely have payments of $4,000 or $4,500 a month to buy instead of $3,000 to rent. He advises potential buyers to get comfortable with the size of their monthly payment before committing to a purchase and plan on staying in their homes for at least five years. “You don’t want to be house-poor in this economy,” Phillips said.

What that actually means for the future of AI technology remains to be seen. Among those who could use some clarity are the government scientists and AI experts from multiple countries gathering in San Francisco this week to deliberate on AI safety measures. Hosted by the Biden administration, officials from a number of U.S. allies — among them Canada, Kenya, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the 27-nation European Union — are scheduled to begin meeting Wednesday in the California city that's a commercial hub for AI development. Their agenda addresses topics such as how to better detect and combat a flood of AI-generated deepfakes fueling fraud, harmful impersonation and sexual abuse. It's the first such meeting since world leaders agreed at an AI summit in South Korea in May to build a network of publicly backed safety institutes to advance research and testing of the technology. Biden signed a sweeping AI executive order last year and this year formed the new AI Safety Institute at the National Institute for Standards and Technology, which is part of the Commerce Department. Trump promised in his presidential campaign platform to “repeal Joe Biden's dangerous Executive Order that hinders AI Innovation, and imposes Radical Leftwing ideas on the development of this technology.” But he hasn't made clear what about the order he dislikes or what he'd do about the AI Safety Institute. Trump's transition team didn't respond to emails this week seeking comment. Tech industry groups — backed by companies including Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft — are mostly pleased with the AI safety approach of Biden's Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and have pushed for Congress to preserve the new agency and codify its work into law. Some experts expect the kind of technical work happening in San Francisco this week to proceed regardless of who's in charge. “There’s no reason to believe that we’ll be doing a 180 when it comes to the work of the AI Safety Institute,” said Heather West, a senior fellow at the Center for European Policy Analysis. Behind the rhetoric, she said there's already been overlap. Trump didn’t spend much time talking about AI during his four years as president, though in 2019 he became the first to sign an executive order about AI. It directed federal agencies to prioritize research and development in the field. Before that, tech experts were pushing the Trump-era White House for a stronger AI strategy to match what other countries were pursuing. Trump in the waning weeks of his administration signed an executive order promoting the use of “trustworthy” AI in the federal government. Those policies carried over into the Biden administration. All of that was before the 2022 debut of ChatGPT, which brought public fascination and worry about the possibilities of generative AI and helped spark a boom in AI-affiliated businesses. What's also different this time is that tech mogul and Trump adviser Elon Musk has been picked to lead a government cost-cutting commission. Musk holds strong opinions about AI's risks and grudges against some AI industry leaders, particularly ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which he has sued."," President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to repeal President Joe Biden's signature artificial intelligence policy when he returns the White House for a second term.

Mortgage rates have been rising for the past month, testing an early July peak of 6.9% last week, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association. Why? Renewed inflation risks tied to Trump's policy proposals lifted the benchmark Treasury bond yields that are used to set home borrowing costs. 💰💸 Don’t miss the move: SIGN UP for TheStreet’s FREE Daily newsletter 💰💸 Still, the MBA reported a modest pickup in purchase applications, helped in part by the lower rates offered to first-time buyers through the Federal Housing Administration loan program. ""For-sale inventory has loosened in some markets, and some potential buyers have been able to take advantage of increasing supply and lower FHA rates, which were down slightly in comparison to the conforming 30-year fixed rate,"" said the MBA's deputy chief economist, Joel Kan. Adam Gray/Getty Images The relentless rise in mortgage rates, which have surged more than three percentage points from pre-pandemic levels, has slashed the number of buyers able to afford homes in an increasingly expensive market. Related: Household debt is rising and it's causing psychological stress In fact, MBA data suggest that new mortgage applications, a key indicator of near-term demand, are at about half of November 2019's levels. The average home price, meanwhile, has risen by more than a third since November 2019, just before the pandemic, to around $425,000, further pressuring the overall cost for first-time buyers. Trump has vowed to loosen restrictions that he says are preventing the construction of new homes. In September, he told an event at the Economic Club of New York that he would ""eliminate regulations that drive up housing costs, with the goal of cutting the cost of a new home in half."" ""We’re going to open up our country to building homes inexpensively, so young people and other people can buy homes,"" he added. Related: Mortgage rate changes loom amid Fed rate cuts & Trump presidency Trump has also claimed that his proposal for mass deportations of illegal immigrants would lower housing costs by reducing overall demand. However, many have argued that the home construction sector relies heavily on the very labor he plans to eliminate. Housing starts are already in the doldrums, with single-family home construction falling 6.9% last month, according to the latest data from the Commerce Department. Permits for new construction, a key demand indicator that is much less influenced by the extreme weather that hurt housing starts, edged upward, hitting the highest level since April. ""Residential construction continues to trend downward, being weighed down by high mortgage rates and a softer job market,"" said Jeffery Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial in Charlotte. ""However, builders reported a recent uptick in traffic of prospective buyers, bolstering the near-term outlook for housing demand in the next six months."" Any move higher in mortgage rates, however, could temper that demand increase very quickly unless Washington takes clear and decisive action, argues CoreLogic's chief economist, Selma Hepp. ""High mortgage rates continue to hinder recovery; however, with homebuilder confidence gradually increasing, more newly built homes will make their way to market in 2025,"" she said. ""The incoming administration could push for more housing to be built, perhaps even making federal lands available for residential construction and potentially limiting regulatory barriers that have added considerable costs to new construction,"" Hepp added. Oliver Allen, senior U.S. economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, argued that mortgage costs will continue to blunt homebuying demand even at current rates. Related: CPI inflation sparks Fed interest rate cut bets ""The relatively high inventory of new homes for sale suggests that single-family construction probably will flatline at best over the coming months, and could easily start falling back again soon if mortgage rates remain around their current levels,"" he said. Realtor data show that the number of active listings last month rose to the highest level since December 2019, although the rise in mortgage rates held down the number of new listings. Homes are also taking a lot longer to sell, with an average of 58 days on the market, the slowest October pace in five years. The bigger impact, however, will likely come from lower mortgage rates, but markets can't bank on that just yet. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told investors last week that the central bank is in ""no hurry"" to lower overall borrowing costs. Stronger-than-expected readings for retail sales and Consumer Price Index inflation last month and Trump's tax and tariff proposals suggest renewed inflation risks over the coming months. CME Group's FedWatch, which tracks betting on Fed rate moves, pegs the odds of a December reduction at around 59%, down from around 85% just before the election. It also suggests fewer cuts next year, indicating a Federal Funds Rate of between 4% and 4.25% by June 2025, just a half point lower than its current level. Lower Fed rates, however, might not spill over into the mortgage market if the new Trump administration follows through on a promise to privatize mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Related: Mr. Musk goes to Washington on a $2 trillion mission The two firms, which have been operating as so-called government-sponsored enterprises since the global financial crisis in 2008, guarantee around $12 trillion in U.S. home loans under the supervision of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.

However, it could also add to overall homebuying costs as the new private entities charge higher rates to compensate for the private capital they would need to support their balance sheets. And even a rapid sale wouldn't likely be completed until 2027, leaving markets focused on Fed rates and new-home supply in the near term. “Further interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve through 2025 should result in lower interest rates for construction and development loans, helping to lead to a stabilization for apartment construction and expansion for single-family homebuilding,” said Robert Dietz, chief economist for the National Association of Home Builders.

10,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ukraine-fires-uk-cruise-missiles-165651276.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 8:56 AM"," (Bloomberg) -- Ukrainian forces fired British cruise missiles at military targets inside Russia for the first time, expanding the use of Western-provided long-range weapons as the 1,000-day conflict enters a new phase. Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting NY Congestion Pricing Survived a Pause. Here’s What Could Kill It The UK approved the use of Storm Shadow missiles in response to Russia deploying North Korean troops in its war against Ukraine, according to a Western official familiar with the matter. The British government considered the move by Moscow to be an escalation, the person said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. The strike came a day after Ukraine deployed US-made Army Tactical Missile Systems, known as ATACMS, for the first time to strike a military facility in the western Bryansk region. It followed the decision by President Joe Biden’s administration to approve Kyiv’s limited use of the weapons to hit targets inside Russia. The prospect of Donald Trump’s return to the White House in January and his pledge to end the war in short order has created a new sense of urgency among Western allies to strengthen Ukraine’s hand ahead of any talks. The Kremlin said on Wednesday it’s prepared to discuss a potential cease-fire in Ukraine with Trump, an overture that met with immediate skepticism from Western officials. “We’ve seen over recent weeks a significant change in the action and in the rhetoric on Ukraine,” UK Defence Secretary John Healey said in Parliament. “We as a nation and as a government are doubling down on our support for Ukraine and determined to do more.” US Treasuries pared declines, the S&P 500 slid and the Nasdaq 100 was down 0.6% after the latest missile launch was announced. The issue of long-term strikes had dominated the Group of 20 leaders’ summit in Brazil this week. UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer didn’t publicly back Biden’s move, despite long being seen as an advocate, leading to questions about whether his government would allow the use of British-made Storm Shadows. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has long called for Western governments to bolster military support, including allowing the use of long-range missiles to hit targets in Russia that are crucial to Vladimir Putin’s war effort. Storm Shadow debris was found in Russia’s Kursk region to the northeast of Ukraine and two missiles were intercepted over Yeysk, an Azov Sea port in Russia’s southern Krasnodar region, according to the Telegram channel Rybar, which has connections to the army and more than 1.3 million subscribers. The information couldn’t be independently verified. In the latest development, the US will also send Kyiv at least $275 million in new weapons, The Associated Press reported on Wednesday, citing US officials it didn’t name. This will come on top of the Biden administration’s decision to provide Ukraine with antipersonnel land mines to blunt steady advances of Russian troops along the entire battle-field. Despite Russia’s expressed readiness to discuss a truce, its forces have intensified their bombardment of Ukraine in recent days. The Kremlin has also issued a revamped nuclear doctrine lowering the threshold for a potential atomic response. Putin has “more than once, or more precisely, constantly, stated that he is ready for contacts and negotiations,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday, according to the state-run Tass news service. He also cautioned that “freezing this conflict will not work for us,” according to Tass. Intensify the Combat Peskov’s comments were in response to a report from Reuters that Moscow could be open to negotiations on halting the fighting roughly along current battle lines. The report cited five unidentified, current and former Russian officials. Several officials from NATO countries said their assessment remained that Putin wasn’t ready for serious talks or making concessions. Russia’s focus remains on expanding its gains on Ukrainian territory and expelling Ukrainian forces from its Kursk region, where they hold territory after an incursion earlier this year, before any eventual deal, two people close to the Kremlin told Bloomberg News. Reuters reported that Putin may agree to discuss a carve-up of four regions in Ukraine — Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson — that Russia illegally declared annexed in 2022, but doesn’t fully control. The Russian leader has declared them to be “forever” part of his country, although only about 77% of the four regions are under the Kremlin’s control, according to Bloomberg calculations based on open-source data. Russia may also be ready to pull out its forces from small slices of territory it holds in the Kharkiv and Mykolaiv regions, according to two of the officials cited in the report. With Trump set to take office in two months, both sides sought to set parameters for what will likely be difficult dealmaking. His return to the White House also raises the prospect of a sharp cut in US aid to Ukraine. Zelenskiy said Tuesday his country would make no concessions on sovereignty or territory. Zelenskiy’s own formula for peace is based on obtaining a clear path to North Atlantic Treaty Organization membership and security guarantees for protection until it joins. “No matter what Putin says, he doesn’t want peace and is not ready to negotiate it,” French President Emmanuel Macron told reporters en route to the Group of 20 summit in Brazil. “Putin’s intention is to intensify the combat, we’ve seen this for weeks.” --With assistance from Torrey Clark, Irina Anghel, Alex Morales and Stuart Biggs.

Here’s What Could Kill It On a day when official data showed inflation accelerated more than forecast in October to well above the BOE’s 2% target, the rate-setter said in a speech at the University of Leeds that he nevertheless expected the economy to “continue to normalize,” with an ongoing trend toward “low and relatively stable inflation.” He went on to say that while he supports the Monetary Policy Committee’s guidance for slow reductions in borrowing costs given lingering economic uncertainties — including the impact of the Labour government’s first budget last month — he’d consider a “less gradual approach” if the evidence starts to “point more clearly to further disinflationary pressures.” While Ramsden’s comments suggest he is less concerned about domestic price pressures than other rate-setter, putting him closer to the dovish end of the MPC, they indicate that uncertainty over inflationary threats domestically and abroad in the US are holding back support for rate cuts. The rate-setters have been hemmed in by the threat of a fresh trade war sparked by President-elect Donald Trump, as well as Chancellor of the Exchequer Rachel Reeves’ Oct. 30 budget, which included measures that increased costs for businesses. Ramsden was one of just two rate-setters to back reductions before a majority voted for the first cut in August.

He said that the MPC’s published forecasts for growth to pick up and inflation to rise above target for the next two years are “plausible.” But he added it’s also “at least as likely that the disinflationary process sustains its recent trend, consistent with more symmetry in wages and price setting, with less domestic inflationary pressure.” Ramsden also predicted that wage growth is more likely to be closer to 2% than 4%, saying this would a “key determinant” for services inflation — which the BOE is monitoring closely.

The gold piece — minted in Carson City, Nevada, in 1870 — sold for $1.44 million including the buyer's premium, a fee paid to the Stack's Bowers Galleries. Only 3,789 of them were produced and an estimated 40 to 50 remain, according to John Kraljevich, who specializes in coin history at the auction house. The auction house did not give any information about who bought the coin. Prior to 1849, the highest denomination for a gold coin was $10, known as the eagle. The $20 double eagle was authorized after the California Gold Rush brought an abundance of gold supply, Kraljevich said. The last time this specific coin was sold was at a Stack’s auction in 1986 for $23,100. “This thing was totally off everybody's radar,” Kraljevich said. “When this thing appeared kind of out of the woodwork after being off the market for 25 years, 30 years, it was almost like a new discovery.” By the time the live auction reached the coin, the bid price had already reached $800,850, far outpacing the other coins in the catalogue. It was sold from the Bernard Richards collection and is the finest grade coin of its type known to exist, according to the industry standard Professional Coin Grading Service. However, it fell short of the auction's prediction that it would break the $2 million barrier. The second finest coin was sold in an auction for $1.62 million in November 2021. The price of collector's coins went up substantially during the COVID-19 pandemic, as people turned to investing in their hobbies, Kraljevich said.

18,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-standoff-between-police-illegal-160234236.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 8:02 AM"," JOHANNESBURG (AP) — South African authorities are embroiled in a standoff with an unconfirmed number of illegal miners who remain underground at an abandoned mine, apparently fearing arrest by police officers deployed at the site. The miners in Stilfontein, in the country’s North West province, have been entering the mine, which is no longer in operation, searching for gold deposits. Such illegal mining has long been going on across South Africa. The standoff in Stilfontein — now in its third week — has highlighted the extent of illegal mining in the country. Police initially prevented basic supplies from getting to the miners but are now sending them packets of instant porridge and trying to get them to come up to the surface. Here's what to know about the standoff: The problem of illegal mining in South Africa Illegal mining has been underway for decades, on the back of the country's once booming mining industry. The illegal miners — known as zama-zamas or ""hustlers” in the Zulu language — search for gold and other precious metal deposits at old and abandoned mines that have been closed or where mining has been halted. Police consider the illegal miners dangerous because they are usually armed and are known to fight violent turf battles among themselves. The trade is believed to be dominated by migrants who enter the country illegally from neighboring Lesotho, Zimbabwe and Mozambique. Police have at times announced successes in arresting the illegal miners but they say they cannot combat the practice unless powerful kingpins who run lucrative syndicates from the trade are apprehended. The government estimates that there are about 6,000 unused or abandoned mines in South Africa and that close to $1 billion is lost annually in revenue due to illegal mining. Police and military join forces in operation “Close the Hole” Since last December, police, government agencies and the military have joined forces in an operation dubbed “Close the Hole” or “Vala Umgodi” in Zulu — basically trying to starve the illegal miners underground by denying them basic supplies. Working in groups, zama-zamas typically remain in the mines for extended periods of time, relying on those on the surface to provide them with food, water, cigarettes and other items. But since the operation began, police have arrested the on-the-ground accomplices and those trying to take supplies to the illegal miners. They have also closed entrances on the ground for taking supplies down. The tactic seems to be trying to force the miners to the surface as their supplies run out. Police say that so far, 14,000 illegal miners have been arrested and that $277 000 in cash and $1.8 million worth of uncut diamonds have been seized. Earlier this month, 565 illegal miners were arrested at an abandoned mine in Orkney, in the same North West province as Stilfontein, when they resurfaced after running out of supplies. What has happened so far at Stilfontein? Members of the Stilfontein local community first tried to bring the illegal miners out but then authorities took over. The mine is 2,500 meters (8,000 feet) deep and getting the zama-zamas, many of them likely armed, out by force would be risky. Three illegal miners have reportedly come out and last Thursday, a decomposed body believed to be of one of the miners was brought to the surface. Police said they are still trying to determine the person’s identity and cause of death. Initial estimates, based on information from community members who tried to mediate, say there are about 4,500 illegal miners underground but police have since suggested the number is more likely between 350 and 400. Provincial authorities this week said plans include sending a “cage” down the mine to lift the miners — a few at a time — to the surface, but the safety of such an operation would need to be assessed first. The government team is also considering sending a camera down to have a visual idea of the situation underground. A civil society group has gone to court to try and force authorities to allow that supplies be sent to the miners. The government argues they are not trapped but refusing to come out to avoid arrest.","JOHANNESBURG (AP) — South African authorities embroiled in a standoff with an unconfirmed number of illegal miners remain underground at an abandoned apparently arrest by police officers at the site.

19,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pivoting-time-war-perfect-storm-172236442.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 9:22 AM"," Operating a DeFi business requires managing extraordinary expectations and desires when the market is pumping, as well as putting robust systems and processes in place to protect people in case the market turns sour. Business is challenging enough on its own, with the human element being a primary part of that, but what happens when a war unexpectedly brings chaos to your doorstep? My company Peanut, a prop trading firm turned market maker from Kyiv, Ukraine, found out the answer the hard way. First, let’s rewind back to 2019. We launched Peanut as a prop trading firm, primarily earning revenue from internal trading strategies on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). In the following years, Peanut kept growing, with an even greater focus on the technical side of the business, aiming to deliver something impactful and meaningful. In anticipation of potential war, Peanut began preparing as early as 2021. We developed action plans for various scenarios, including the possibility of Kyiv being captured. We secured properties in Western Ukraine, such as in Lviv and the Carpathians, to ensure operational continuity and safety for our staff. This proactive approach meant that when the invasion occurred, 90% of our team relocated quickly, minimizing disruptions to our services. Then, in early 2022, Ukraine came under attack from Russia. At the same time, we noticed that the market was starting to change and become more competitive. Our competitors and even our main client (at that time) were pursuing mergers and acquisitions, as they felt this was the best way to stay ahead, but we bucked this trend. Instead of partnering up with other small and medium market makers to combine into something more powerful, we instead decided to brave it alone and invest more in Peanut. The company was small, technically focused, and relied on our strong personal networks. We had almost no sales division. Instead, we thrived on word of mouth and our connections from previous years. But during late 2022 and early 2023, we decided to build all the necessary departments to become a full-scale market maker. It was quite hard because, for a company from Eastern Europe, competencies in our company were mostly on the technical side. This pivot turned out to be one of the most crucial moments in Peanut’s existence, all with a war raging on outside. Becoming a full-scale market maker required us to staff a whole company, including, at last, a sales department. Still, we continued to dig into the technical expertise that had led us there. We had to build everything from the ground up, repositioning ourselves while navigating the constant challenges and daily struggles of war. There were daily power outages caused by Russian missile attacks, often we received messages from our employees that they couldn’t work from shelters; other times, they devoted time and effort to volunteering. I believe we were the only market maker in the world who continued launching projects under such conditions. Our clients had no idea about the circumstances we were working in. Despite disruptions, logistical challenges, and the chilling implications of an ongoing war, my team and I pushed through the adversities and resource limitations to compete with major market makers and win more market share. To achieve that, we needed to make not just a business pivot, but a strategic shift towards a particular type of client. I was acutely aware that smaller market makers were dissatisfied with larger and even medium-sized firms that often lacked transparency, efficiency, and profit-sharing mechanisms. I felt that by leveraging my existing network in the space, we could continue to grow, despite targeting smaller clients. We also took advantage of our relocation to Europe, attending more crypto conferences, which would have been logistically challenging if we were still based in Ukraine. This increased our visibility and allowed us to expand our B2C division, transitioning from being primarily a searcher and MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) specialist to becoming a full-fledged market maker. I’d say the key to our strategic shift was educating token issuers on the reality of market-making contracts, which many find misleading, whether intentionally or not. Many of the older token issuers still expect market makers to pump their tokens, leading to dissatisfaction with the services they receive from other market makers. This created opportunities for us to educate people on how things should be done and what the role of a market maker entails, including what is prohibited to do in the market and what constitutes normal market behavior. The pivot proved successful and allowed us to continue scaling. Once the war started, the Ukrainian IT industry, previously large and steadily growing, faced challenges as major companies questioned the reliability of working with Ukrainian firms, leading to reduced orders and layoffs. This made hiring easier than in 2021, so we continued recruiting in Ukraine, and now 100% of our technical staff are Ukrainian and we try to hire and give jobs to young people. Our workforce is distributed, so we have about 50% of our personnel in Ukraine and the rest in different countries across the world, including Portugal, Germany, Middle East and both North and South Americas. Despite the war, we’ve grown from 30 to 60 employees by leveraging the availability of IT specialists in Ukraine who were more accessible and at competitive rates because of industry disruptions. This enabled us to build a highly capable MEV team that now ranks among the top three globally in certain strategies – a unique feat for an Eastern European market maker.The legal environment has become more challenging for our competitors, but our tech-driven approach with proprietary algorithms gives us an even greater edge, attracting new clients from smaller firms. Not all companies can boast our resilience and robustness, navigating the crypto winter, pivoting strategically and managing growth, managing our team during wartime, and coming out the other side better, stronger, faster, bigger, and with more demand than ever before."," Operating a DeFi business requires managing expectations and desires when the market is pumping, as as putting robust systems and processes in place to protect people in case the market turns sour.

Here’s What Could Kill It The Santiago-based firm delivered another sharp drop in earnings as its lithium sales prices fell almost 24% in the third quarter from the prior three months. SQM said Wednesday in its earnings statement that the market trend will continue, with fourth-quarter realized prices expected to be lower than the three months ended Sept. 30. Lithium is on track for a second year of price pullbacks amid a glut in the key ingredient in electric-vehicle batteries. While there’s been a mini-recovery in China in recent weeks, analysts have warned there’ll still be too much supply in 2025. “Although demand continues to grow at a strong pace, mainly driven by strong EV sales growth in China, we continue to see the prices pressured by a temporary oversupply,” Chief Executive Officer Ricardo Ramos said on a call with analysts. Still, low-cost supplier SQM has vowed to keep increasing output and sales volume, churning out close to 210,000 metric tons this year and 230,000 tons next year. The company retained its annual sales volume guidance of 190,000 tons to 195,000 tons and said it expects to increase sales next year in line with higher production. On Wednesday’s call, executives said market oversupply is temporary, with demand set to grow 16% to 18% annually over the next five years. American depository receipts of SQM rose as much as 1.8% in New York. Many of SQM’s rivals have curtailed output and slashed spending plans to defend margins. The market has struggled since a late-2022 peak, as new projects came on stream just as global EV adoption began to slow. There has been 190,000 tons of lithium mine capacity curtailments since late last year and another 50,000 tons of delayed projects, according to CRU Group. As a result, the consultancy cut its supply forecast by 14% for next year.

22,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysis-opec-may-stick-deep-154907895.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 7:49 AM"," By Alex Lawler, Ahmad Ghaddar and Robert Harvey LONDON (Reuters) - OPEC+ will have little room to manoeuvre on oil policy when it meets in December: it would be risky to increase output because of weak demand, and difficult to deepen supply cuts because some members want to pump more, sources and analysts said. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies led by Russia, the group known as OPEC+, which pumps around half the world's oil, has already delayed a plan to gradually lift production by several months this year. It may push back output increases again when it meets on Dec. 1 due to weak global oil demand, according to three OPEC+ sources familiar with the discussions. Ministers last shelved the increase for a month when they met virtually on Nov. 3. ""I can't say it's popular in the group but there would be no strong objection to a delay until the first quarter,"" one of the OPEC+ sources said, declining to be identified by name. Two other OPEC+ sources said it was too early to say what the group will decide. OPEC and the Saudi government communications office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. OPEC+ had planned to slowly roll back production cuts with small increases over many months in 2024 and 2025. But a slowdown in Chinese and global demand, and rising output outside the group, have put a dampener on that plan. This has left OPEC+ maintaining output cuts for longer than it had thought. The group has cut output by 5.86 million barrels per day, or about 5.7% of global demand, in a series of steps agreed since 2022 to support the market. Despite OPEC+'s cuts and delays to output hikes, oil prices have mostly stayed in the $70-$80 per barrel range this year. Saudi Arabia was keen to address an internal issue of poor compliance with production targets from some OPEC+ members, sources said, before proceeding with any output increase for the group. Some members including Iraq have reduced output in recent months, so compliance has improved. That could give the group a little room for a coordinated small increase in supply - as long as demand supports it. Increasing output in a market with little demand growth, however, would risk weakening prices. It is a tactic OPEC+ could use to put pressure on rivals - but one that would also hurt OPEC+ countries that rely on oil revenues. Many OPEC members need a price of over $70 to balance their budgets and could not sustain a long period of oil below $50. LOW CHANCE OF 'PRICE WAR' Nonetheless, OPEC+'s falling market share has led to speculation that sooner or later, it may launch a price war to push rivals out. The last time OPEC did this was in 2014-2015, when it raised output to squeeze U.S. shale firms. OPEC+'s oil output is equal to 48% of world supply, the lowest since it was formed in 2016 with a market share of over 55%, according to Reuters calculations based on International Energy Agency figures. The U.S. has become the world's largest oil producer, pumping more than 20 million bpd or a fifth of global production. Top OPEC producer Saudi Arabia's crude output is less than 9% of the global oil total, while OPEC supplies around 25%. The 2014 price war had a big impact on shale producers but ultimately failed to stem the boom. U.S. shale and other producers have also cut costs over time, making it harder for OPEC+ to win a new battle. The cost of producing oil onshore in the Middle East has an average breakeven price of $27 a barrel, according to consultant Rystad Energy. Rystad puts North American costs at $45, down from $85 in 2014. ""Crude needs to price below $40-$45 to significantly curtail non-OPEC supply,"" said Aldo Spanjer of BNP Paribas, who puts the chance of a price war at just 20%. Consolidation in the U.S. oil industry would also make it harder for OPEC+ to win a price war. In the past two years U.S. majors Exxon Mobil and Chevron have bought some of the biggest shale producers. They have deep pockets and diverse portfolios. ""We think speculation about a possible supply war is overblown,"" said Richard Bronze of Energy Aspects. ""Unlike in 2015-2016, the group recognises that U.S. and wider non-OPEC production is not going to decline rapidly."" DEEPER CUTS ALSO UNLIKELY Analysts at Macquarie said the prospects for OPEC+ increasing output in the first half of 2025 looked tenuous given seasonal demand weakness. Deepening production cuts is also unlikely because several OPEC+ members are pushing to pump more, not less. Key among them is the United Arab Emirates, which argues it has kept output at around 3 million bpd for too long, far below its capacity. The UAE has already secured an increased quota for 2025, and any delay to output hikes would need to address this issue, OPEC+ sources said. Iraq has also been pushing for a higher quota. ""We think deeper cuts, which ultimately may be required to support oil prices next year, could be difficult to stomach,"" said Walt Chancellor of Macquarie.

Qualcomm, which gets the majority of its revenue from both designing and licensing handset chips, has been expanding into semiconductors that go into cars, personal computers and other devices. The company now expects those businesses to generate a combined $22 billion in sales by 2029. Eight billion dollars of that will come from Qualcomm’s automotive segment, where it already has partnerships with the likes of BMW to increase computing functionality in vehicles and push toward more autonomous driving. Qualcomm forecast that $14 billion will come from its Internet of Things segment, which includes extended reality devices and industrial functions. It also includes PCs, expected to account for $4 billion. The company’s Snapdragon X Elite chips power Microsoft’s latest generation Surface laptops, which feature the GenAI Copilot assistant. “Everybody that buys an X Elite is extremely happy with it,” Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon said in an interview following the Investor Day in New York. “From all of our OEMs (original equipment manufacturers) and Microsoft, the current response is exceeding everybody's expectation.” Amon called the $4 billion target for the PC business “high confidence.” Some analysts, however, said the road there may not be smooth. “While management is optimistic about AI PC opportunities, Windows-on-ARM skepticism and intense competition (from both x86 and ARM SoC suppliers) could limit QCOM’s opportunity,” Raymond James’ Srini Pajuri wrote in a note to clients. He has a hold-equivalent “market perform” rating on the stock. Bank of America’s Tal Liani rates Qualcomm a “buy,’ and “came away incrementally positive on Qualcomm’s long-term positioning and the diversification outside of handsets.” But Liani pointed out that not only is the company entering markets with emerging tech, but that it also needs to grab market share. ""These markets need to develop to support Qualcomm's long-term targets, of which the pace and magnitude is uncertain,"" he wrote. Qualcomm’s biggest business remains smartphones, and its ramped-up diversification comes as Apple is working on migrating away from Qualcomm modems. As for the Android-based business, Amon said he’s projecting mid-single-digit growth, what he calls a “conservative assumption.” That means the company expects to end the decade with its revenue about evenly split between handsets at 50% and autos and Internet of Things combined for the other 50%. “The narrative of solid earnings power even ex-AAPL seems alive, and in general the assumptions don’t appear to require any huge stretches,” wrote Bernstein’s Stacy Rasgon, who has an “outperform” recommendation on Qualcomm shares. Qualcomm shares have lagged this year amidst that expected Apple transition, rising just under 7% compared with the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index’s (^SOX) 16% gain. So what about AI? Amon expects adoption of smartphones with more AI capabilities to be an unpredictable process, but one that’s ultimately beneficial for Qualcomm. “It is hard to make a prediction because at the end of the day, it's all based on what developers are going to come up with,” he said in the interview. ""I can go back to the conversation between feature phones and smartphones and Blackberries and smartphones — started with 10 apps, then a hundred apps, then thousands of apps, and then you start to see the big switch. And I feel the same way about AI use cases. I can't really tell you it's gonna be this year or next year.

(Chart: SONAR) LTL pricing is far more complex than that of other freight modes and has more to do with the density of the freight being shipped than the distance. According to Zach Strickland, SONAR’s head of freight market intelligence, “revenue per hundredweight [published by public carriers in earnings releases] is the worst way to look at LTL pricing.” That’s because the aggregated carrier metrics fail to account for changes in the mix of freight and the associated impact that has on pricing.

Goldblatt told lenders at a Tuesday hearing in Delaware. “What will happen if I approve this, is that the minority lenders will sue and they will win and they will be entitled to the damage,” Judge Goldblatt said, referring to the DIP plan. ATD, an automotive parts distributor backed by private equity firms TPG Capital and Ares Management Corp., filed for bankruptcy in October. A small group of lenders filed an objection to its financing plan last week. The crux of their issue was that some lenders, holding the same loan as the DIP lenders, were excluded from participating the debtor-in-possession financing, according to court papers and letters. The exclusion would constitute a breach of loan agreement, the lender group said, an argument that Judge Goldblatt said he “inclined to believe” at the hearing. Part of the existing plan is designed as a roll-up, a practice that moves existing debt to the front of the repayment line in lockstep with new money. That would move about $1.1 billion of debt ahead of their ranking of getting repaid and “devastate” their recoveries, the opposing group said in another filing. The dissenting group consists of Oaktree Capital Management LP, AllianceBernstein Holding LP, PenderFund Capital Management Ltd., among others, according to court documents filed Monday. In an earlier filing, the major group of lenders said the opposing group “want to benefit from all the hard work the ad-hoc group has done” and there is no alternative option if the current financing plan got rejected. The judge didn’t make a decision on Tuesday. After receiving comments, a lawyer representing the major group of lenders said he would hold a call to discuss with his clients.

Here’s What Could Kill It The report alleges that “virtually every aspect of Oklo’s investment case warrants skepticism,” sending the stock down as much as 10%. Oklo shares have whip-sawed recently, rallying more than 20% this week through Tuesday’s close after falling 25% on Friday following its earnings release and the expiration of a lockup period that allows key investors like Peter Thiel’s venture capital firm to start selling shares. Oklo did not respond to requests for comment. Since the company went public via a special purpose acquisition merger in May, its shares have soared more than 150%. “In classic SPAC fashion, Oklo has sold the market on inflated unit economics while grossly underestimating the time and capital it will take to commercialize its product,” the Kerrisdale report said. The company is among a wave of firms developing so-called small modular reactors that are expected to be built in factories and assembled on site. Advocates say the approach will make it faster and cheaper to build nuclear power plants, but the technology is unproven. Only a handful have been developed, and only in Russia and China. Oklo has said it expects its first system to go into service in 2027, but the Kerrisdale report highlights numerous technical and regulatory hurdles that may delay that schedule. Oklo is pursuing a new technology that it said will make its design safer and cheaper than conventional reactors in use today. The company’s design doesn’t have approval from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, a process that typically takes years. Wall Street is split on the company thus far. Of the four analysts covering Oklo, two have buy-equivalent ratings and two are neutral. The average price target implies about 5% return from where shares are trading.

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting NY Congestion Pricing Survived a Pause. Here’s What Could Kill It A high-speed fiber optic cable connecting Finland and Germany was cut early Monday by what was likely an external impact and a nearby link between Lithuania and Sweden was damaged on Sunday. It was the second such incident in the Baltic Sea in just over a year. The bulk carrier, Yi Peng 3, was in the vicinity of the cables when they were damaged, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It has been anchored in the northern part of the Danish straits since Tuesday, with Danish Navy diving ship Soloven close by. “The Danish Defence can confirm that we are present in the area near the Chinese ship Yi Peng 3,” the armed forces said in a post on X. The military stopped short of linking the ship to the cable incident, and said they had no further comments. Yi Peng 3 had departed Russian port Ust-Luga on Friday. While vessels sometimes stop for refueling, its location in the Danish waters is not a typical site for such activity. The incidents are being probed by Swedish police as possible sabotage, and German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius on Tuesday said the events have to be investigated as such an act. Lin Jian, a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry in Beijing, said on Wednesday that “China always fully fulfills flag state obligations and asks Chinese vessels to strictly abide by relevant laws and regulations.” “We also attach great importance to protecting the safety and security of infrastructure,” he said, adding that China works “with the international community to vigorously advance the construction and protection of global information infrastructure including undersea cables.” Germany has already stepped up patrols around its northern coastal areas due to the 2022 attack on the Nord Stream gas pipelines and protecting critical infrastructure is a top priority, Interior Ministry spokesman Cornelius Funke said at a news conference in Berlin. The Swedish navy is conducting an investigation of the seabed to see what may have happened, spokesman Jimmie Adamsson told newspaper Goteborgs-Posten. Finland’s National Bureau of Investigation decided to open a criminal investigation into the damage caused to the sea cable between Finland and Germany, probing the incident as “aggravated criminal mischief and aggravated interference with communications,” according to a statement. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said earlier Wednesday that it wouldn’t be a surprise if the severing of the two data cables in the Baltic Sea was found to be intentional. “If the immediate assessment is that this is sabotage, and that it comes from outside, then it is obviously serious,” Frederiksen said, according to a report by news agency Ritzau. There’s a high likelihood that a 1,200-kilometer (750-mile) high-speed fiber optic Helsinki-Rostock link serving data centers is completely cut as all of its fiber connections are down, its owner Cinia Oy has said. A repair ship expected to reach the site next week is due to try and identify what caused the breakage. All four nations affected by cable breaches are also members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Just over a year ago, the anchor of a passing ship severed two data cables and a gas pipeline on the seabed of the Gulf of Finland, and the military bloc pledged to respond if the damage proved to be intentional. In his remarks, Pistorius pointed to Russia as posing a hybrid and military threat to the European Union. Russia has denied involvement in any of the incidents. --With assistance from Iain Rogers, Tom Fevrier and Christopher Jungstedt.

The current benchmark rate is set in a range of 4.50% to 4.75% percent, and Cook said she felt the three-quarters-of-a-percentage-point lopped from it at the Fed's two prior meetings was ""a strong step toward removing policy restriction.""

34,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trafigura-cut-share-buybacks-top-175553086.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 9:55 AM"," (Bloomberg) -- Trafigura Group is reducing its share buybacks this year, as a drop in profits coincides with a generational succession at the top of the commodity trading giant, according to people familiar with the matter. Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting NY Congestion Pricing Survived a Pause. Here’s What Could Kill It Several senior departures mean that Trafigura faces an unusually large bill for buybacks, which are the main way it rewards the roughly 1,400 top employees who own the company. Each year, Trafigura commits to repurchasing a significant chunk of shares from its employees — with payments to larger shareholders being spread over a series of installments. When employees leave, the trader buys them out, also over several years. This year, Trafigura is making lower commitments to buy back shares from existing employees, and also deferring some of the already-planned buybacks, the people said, asking not to be identified as the matter isn’t public. The company has started informing employees of the decisions in recent days, following the close of its financial year at the end of September. Trafigura’s share repurchases have become a conduit for vast riches in recent years, as an energy crisis delivered a bonanza to the trading industry. Since the Covid pandemic, Trafigura has paid out about $10 billion to its senior staff through the buyback system. Still, the trader is now facing a sharp drop in profitability driven by lower market volatility — earnings are normalizing after by far the most profitable period in the company’s history — as well as a $1.1 billion hit in Mongolia. What’s more, a recent exodus of senior executives means it also has built up a hefty obligation to buy out departing shareholders. A spokesperson for Trafigura declined to comment. Trafigura has wide discretion about when to make the buybacks, and it’s not the first time that the trading house has delayed payments. The changes are a way for Trafigura to conserve cash at a time when its profits are falling, while also allowing a new generation of traders to build a larger ownership stake in the company, the people said. Still, they underscore a tension within Trafigura, as a new group of leaders braces for leaner times ahead, even as a large share of the company’s profits goes to pay out the previous generation. Senior executives who have recently left the company include Mike Wainwright, the company’s long-time chief operating officer, who is due to stand trial next month on Swiss corruption charges, which he denies; Jose Larocca, the long-time head of oil; Christophe Salmon, who was chief financial officer; former head of M&A Jesus Fernandez; and former co-head of metals Kostas Bintas. The management succession will culminate in January, when Richard Holtum takes over as chief executive officer. He replaces Jeremy Weir, who has led Trafigura for a decade and will become chairman. One of the most closely watched numbers at Trafigura is the annual increase in the price of shares held by employees, which in turn is used to determine how much the company buys back from each shareholder. The price gain is calculated each year by Trafigura based on its annual results, and then communicated to shareholders. This year’s share price increase was 71%, the people said. That’s down substantially from 188% last year and 247% in 2022, reflecting a sharp drop in the company’s profit for the financial year through September, which it’s due to report publicly in the next few weeks. Trafigura typically buys back an amount from each shareholder equivalent to the growth in value of their shares in the previous financial year, leaving the value of their ownership constant, according to several current and former employees. This year, while the amounts vary from one employee to another, on average the company is planning to buy back less from current employees. That means the value of their shareholding will grow, but also that they will get less cash in the near term. The company is also deferring some buybacks that had been due to be made in the coming year — a move that affects former as well as current employees. When a shareholder leaves Trafigura, the value of their shares is fixed and the company generally agrees to buy them back in five installments: one on departure, and then at the end of each subsequent year, according to a 2021 prospectus. The company uses a similar arrangement to buy back shares each year from continuing employees, with smaller shareholders being paid out in one go while larger shareholders are also paid out in installments. By slowing the payouts to current employees, Trafigura is increasing the financial jeopardy for any who might leave to competitors, at a time of hot competition for trading talent. The company recently extended the contractual period during which some of its senior traders can’t work for competitors to as much as 12 months, Bloomberg reported previously.

I think after that, we will go into January and February, and the weather will slow it down. I think that March will start seeing a nice turn in freight.” Parker was the keynote speaker on Day 2 of FreightWaves’ F3: Future of Freight Festival in Chattanooga, Tennessee. He was joined on stage Wednesday by FreightWaves CEO Craig Fuller in a discussion that dived into leadership and innovation in logistics. Chattanooga-based Covenant Logistics Group (NYSE: CVLG) was founded in 1986 by David and Jacqueline Parker. The company started as Covenant Transport with 25 trucks and 50 trailers. Today, Covenant Logistics owns a fleet of over 2,500 trucks and offers a portfolio of transportation and logistics services throughout the country, including asset-based expedited and dedicated truckload capacity, as well as asset-light warehousing, transportation management and freight brokerage services. Parker said listening to customers is a big part of Covenant Logistics’ success over the years. “At the end of the day, freight is going to go the way freight has got to go,” Brown said. “It’s going to find its home. We’ve always got to be open. Our eyes have to be open. Our ears are going to be open. We’ve got to be listening to our customers that are telling us where freight is going.” With the presidential election over, Parker said he feels the mood in the transportation industry and Wall Street has been more optimistic. Parker has recently been in New York to attend an industry conference, as well as to celebrate the company’s transfer of its stock listing to the New York Stock Exchange from the Nasdaq Global Select Market. “No. 1, the flavor yesterday at Wall Street, shareholders and the carriers that were there … they are thrilled with the election, because I think besides putting away doubt, they do see the policies. This administration’s trucking policies are a lot better than the Biden administration. I know that the trucking industry is going to be in much better shape from regulations.” Parker said the Trump administration could likely peel back Environmental Protection Agency regulations on emissions, as well as ease up on policies pushing for electrification in the transportation industry. “Let’s get clean air: I believe in all that stuff but also believe that it needs to be realistic, and that is, we’re not going to be there in 2030,” Parker said. “[The Biden administration] came out with saying we’re going to have to have all electric engines in 2030. No, you’re not. Quit playing the game, because it ain’t going to happen. That can happen in 2040 maybe, but it’s not happening in 2030.” While Trump’s proposed tariffs could slow freight movement, the Trump administration’s focus on domestic oil production could be a boost for the trucking industry, according to Parker. “The thing that I’m wondering is that if the tariffs happen, or how much the tariffs are, no nation in the world is going to give up on America,” he said. “We have 340 million people that buy stuff, more than anywhere in the world. They buy stuff. They’re not going to give up if [Trump] puts X amount percent of tariffs; they’re going to figure a way to continue to send it over to America. It was evident by the last four years that Trump had in office, when he put tariffs in. Inflation was nothing. The tariffs are not going to blow up inflation, because the other side of the tariffs is his quote, ‘Drill, baby drill.’ That is going to be advantageous for reduction in pricing.” The post Covenant Logistics CEO sees trucking market rising in 2025 appeared first on FreightWaves."," Logistics Group co-founder and CEO David Parker predicts the trucking industry’s peak season will positive growth this holiday season. “Last week started the first week of peak that will until about Christmas, and peak, it shot up about 105% last week, and this week peak is growing even more,” Parker said. think that peak is going be a good peak, I think for the first time in about three or four think after that, we will go into January February, and the weather will slow it down.

37,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bitcoin-hits-time-high-near-165110635.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 9:51 AM"," Bitcoin notched a new all-time high near $95,000 as options trading began on Bitcoin ETFs. BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, was the first to see options activity, with more than $2 billion in notional exposure stacking up — an unusually high volume for a debut. In total, call options outweighed put options by about a four-to-one margin according to Bloomberg's count, indicating bets were more optimistic that Bitcoin's price would continue to rise. “I think that that allows for leverage in the U.S. market pretty efficiently,” Douro Labs co-founder Mike Cahill told Coinage. “You certainly see that the leverage looks like it’s going on the long side so that’s quite a bullish correlation between the all-time highs and the options.” Options contracts allow traders to make bets on where an underlying asset's price might move over a given time period. For Bitcoin, those bets had largely been restricted to sophisticated traders. With the launch of options on Bitcoin ETFs, those are now more accessible. Following the launch of options on BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF, next up are options on Grayscale's Bitcoin ETF as well as Bitwise's Bitcoin ETF and others. Custodia Bank founder Caitlin Long previously said that Bitcoin options could be a double-edged sword as it might allow for Wall Street to play games with an asset that unlike others is fundamentally scarce with a cap of 21 million tokens. “It’s a double-edged sword,” Long said, referencing the typical leverage games that Wall Street is so adept at playing. “They privatize profits and socialize losses.” It’s a dynamic that anyone familiar with traditional finance knows all too well, and it’s one that has reared its head time and time again, whether in traditional equity markets or the now-infamous crypto exchange collapses like FTX. As Long explained, “An ETF is a derivative. And then an option on an ETF is a derivative on a derivative.” It’s a classic case of stacking financial products on top of each other until the structure becomes dangerously fragile. For now, Bitcoin's price is marching higher as options make their debut."," notched new all-time high near $95,000 as options trading began on Bitcoin BlackRock's Bitcoin ETF, IBIT, the to see options activity, with more than $2 in notional exposure stacking up — an high volume for a debut.

Larkin said an early stage company’s ability to scale quickly is key to success, and that is usually only realistic if the potential market is large enough. He said it’s also preferable that a new company is working on a problem that no one else is trying to solve. “Early stage folks come in a lot of sizes, shapes and forms,” Larkin said at the Chattanooga, Tennessee, event. He said single-entrepreneur companies tend to struggle. He advises startups to have someone with experience in the freight industry in addition to a tech visionary. “If you’re thinking about starting up a business, and you’re sort of a tech-oriented person, make sure you partner with somebody who’s really engrained in the freight business.” He prefers working with entrepreneurs on their second or third idea as they have been through the process and have likely learned from past mistakes. “It’s very difficult for the smartest guy in the world to come in out of left field into this industry … and have an immediate impact,” Larkin said. “It’s very complicated and there’s a lot of nuance and there’s a lot of segmentation.” Larkin said FreightTech valuations are still too high in some instances. He recalled his days in “the wild west of finance” following deregulation when trucking companies were able to go public with a $60 million post-money market cap. He said only really large companies can go public now, referencing temperature-controlled real estate investment trust Lineage’s recent initial public offering, which took in $5.1 billion in gross proceeds.

Gary Wang testified for parts of three day s at Bankman-Fried’s trial last year, explaining his role as FTX’s chief technology officer in a fraud that Judge Lewis A.

Nothing I do will ever be able to make up for it.” Roos described Wang's work since the fraud in heroic terms, saying he was “the first FTX cooperator to come in the door” even though he played a minimal role in the fraud and did not create the complicated computer code that enabled the fraud. In his first day of meeting with prosecutors, Wang “deciphered basically half the case for us,” he said, adding that it might have taken the government months or years to figure out the code. He said Wang has continued to cooperate with several agencies and those seeking to recover money for FTX investors.

Federato, a startup riding that momentum, has now raised $40 million to expand its business: an AI-powered underwriting platform to help insurers better understand and respond to risk. Stepstone Group is leading the round with previous backers Emergence Capital, Caffeinated Capital and Pear VC participating. The startup has now raised $80 million in total. It is not disclosing valuation, CEO and co-founder Will Ross confirmed in an interview that it was a “serious, significant upround” that was multiples bigger than its previous valuation. For some context, Federato’s last valuation was $125 million based on a fundraise from last year. Further context is that Duck Creek, one of its competitors, was snapped up by Visa Equity for $2.6 billion in 2023. The latter company offers a wider set of SaaS for insurance companies, it does show you directionally where the valuation for a lucrative AI product aimed at this sector could go. (Insurance, globally, is estimated to be one of the biggest industries in the world, totalling multiple trillions of dollars in value, with underwriting one of key areas where AI is expected to play a major role.) Federato was co-founded by Will Ross (CEO) and William Steenbergen (CTO). Ross was one of the early employees at the Watson group at IBM, where he worked on the deal to buy the Weather Company and leverage the data from there to build environmental models. Later he went back to graduate school at Stanford, where he met the other William (Steenbergen). It was 2021 and AI was already all the rage (January 2021 was the month OpenAI released Dall-E, its image generator). But it was already being positioned by many as a replacement for repetitive work. “We had a shared thesis that AI could better be applied to optimizing what no human could do or had time to do, versus automating away low value tasks,” Ross said. “The analogy here is Uber, DoorDash. These are consumer companies, but they solve a problem no human had the time to effectively solve. And those tend to look like these optimization problems.” Ross was in the business school, and Steenbergen was in working in computational and mathematical engineering. “We were actually collaborating on a very different project, a wildfire modeling project,” Ross continued. “And we started to get to know the insurance industry, because they were interested in the wildfire modeling.” That in turn led the pair to thinking about the wider challenges in insurance: typically when insurance companies are working through an underwriting process and coming up with how to cost a product against the risk around it; or even what products to build at all, there will be a team in-house bringing together vast amounts of data both directly and indirectly related to potential insurance scenarios, crunching numbers to get better insight and make more informed selections. Federato’s solution, which the company calls RiskOps, provides decision support around that process. The startup claims that customers see 90% improvement in “time to quote” (how long it takes to give a quote on a particular service in aid of winning a sale) among other efficiency improvements. The pair’s initial foray into modelling wildfires led to one of its early customers, Kettle: a reinsurance platform that has up to now mostly focused on one market, California, and one big problem: reinsurance and fire catastrophes, a big issue in the state. It also counts larger companies like Nationwide among its customers. While speed is definitely something that AI brings to bear in its work, another important aspect here is how it is used to evaluate large amounts of data, an important part of the diligence that insurance companies must go through in their work. “We are in the land of Facebook, and moving fast and breaking things,” Lotti Siniscalco, a partner at Emergence, said. “But in insurance you cannot do that.” This article originally appeared on TechCrunch at https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/20/federato-fixes-insurance-risk-analysis-with-ai-raises-40m/"," Insurance has been fertile ground for artificial intelligence working as it does at the nexus of giant datasets, risk assessment, predictive analytics, fintech and customer service.

Here’s What Could Kill It S&P Global Ratings late Tuesday put the city on “CreditWatch with negative implications” as officials mull one-time measures to close the shortfall. While the firm affirmed its BBB+ rating, analysts see at least a one-in-two chance of a cut in the next three months. A downgrade hinges on the 2025 budget passage and whether the gap is closed with one-time fixes rather than structural changes, Scott Nees, an S&P credit analyst, said in a statement. “The negative watch indicates S&P’s concern that Chicago may undo years of budgetary discipline, which is valid,” Dennis Derby, a portfolio manager for Allspring Global Investments LLC, said on Wednesday. “There is time to work through budgetary issues constructively and should that fail to occur, the city’s credit profile would weaken.” The city is staring down a $982.4 million shortfall next year and Johnson faces mounting fiscal challenges such as rising pension and labor costs that make his progressive agenda increasingly difficult to implement. Plus, federal pandemic aid is running out, revenue is falling short of expectations and woefully underfunded pensions are testing the third-largest US city. Last week, the Chicago City Council rejected Johnson’s plan to raise property taxes by $300 million that would have helped close the gap, forcing the mayor to find alternative ways to balance the budget. During a press conference on Tuesday, Johnson said he was considering a $150 million property tax hike as well as boosting the tax on cloud computing and other levies to generate revenue. “We believe that this budget could represent a critical juncture for the city’s credit trajectory, as failure to implement structural solutions to contain the deficit will only defer action on hard choices that are likely necessary to place the city’s finances on a sustainable footing,” S&P analysts wrote in a report evaluating the credit. Sluggish Revenue The city already enacted a hiring freeze in September and curbed other expenses to save costs. A city spokesperson didn’t provide a comment on S&P’s move. “With COVID-era surplus funds now largely expended or being used to close the fiscal 2025 budget gap, Chicago’s ability to manage the budget deficit will have diminished going into the next budget cycle,” according to S&P. The company said that sluggish revenue performance and rising costs for personnel and pensions are projected to push the deficit to $1.1 billion in 2026 and $1.3 billion in 2027. The current rating, three steps above junk, is “untenable in the face of such a large structural deficit in the absence of a clear and politically actionable plan for addressing it,” S&P said. S&P also warned that the likelihood of Chicago ending the year without an adopted spending plan has increased after budget hearings have already been delayed by several weeks and because of the “politically fraught nature of budget negotiations thus far.” Allspring’s Derby is waiting to see how the discussions move forward. “We expect to see some budgetary discussions over the near term, and so long as there is an earnest dialogue, the city’s credit profile should remain robust,” Derby said. Fitch Ratings on Wednesday affirmed Chicago’s rating at A-, one step higher than S&P, with a stable outlook but still cautioned that “rating stability is predicated on Chicago’s ability and willingness to continue to adhere to sound fiscal practices.” “A reversion to its prior pattern of reliance on non-recurring solutions, aggressive revenue assumptions, and new recurring spending or revenue cuts without offsetting actions would trigger negative rating action,” according to Fitch.

45,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tv-time-points-apples-significant-163110920.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 8:31 AM"," TV Time, a popular TV and movie tracking and recommendations app with more than 30 million registered users, disappeared from Apple's App Store for several weeks, leading to questions about its future from the app's avid fan base. Considering that 2.5 million users use the app every month to track what they're watching and to engage in a social network where they can comment on individual episodes, vote for favorite characters, post images and GIFs, and connect with other users, its disappearance didn't go unnoticed. On November 1, the company announced via a post on X that it was aware the app had been removed from the App Store and that it was ""working with Apple to get it back ASAP."" It offered no other details as to what may have caused the app to be pulled or how soon it could return. Users continually reply to that post in hopes of an update, but unfortunately for TV Time fans, several weeks passed without a resolution. After TechCrunch reached out to TV Time and Apple about the app's removal, the app was reinstated on the App Store. TV Time has long been operated by entertainment analytics platform Whip Media Group following its acquisition in 2016 of the French startup, formerly known as TVShow Time. Similar to other services like Reelgood or JustWatch, the app can direct users to where a show or movie can be streamed and can suggest other series you might like, based on your viewing activity. During the time of its removal, existing iOS users were still able to access the app on their devices, but anyone trying to install TV Time on a new iPhone or iPad would have been out of luck. In addition, the App Store removal meant TV Time was no longer able to issue updates to its app to its current user base. TechCrunch reached out to the company to find out why the app was pulled. According to Whip Media Chief Marketing Officer Jerry Inman, the dispute with Apple had to do with the mishandling of a routine intellectual property (IP) complaint. TV Time users had uploaded some TV and film cover art to the app, leading a company to claim copyrights over the app and issue a takedown notice via the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). While TV Time complies with the DMCA, it asked the complainant to provide proof of ownership -- like a copyright registration -- which it was unable to do. Despite the lack of evidence, TV Time says it still removed the images from both the TV Time platform and its metadata platform, TheTVDB. However, the complainant also demanded a financial settlement not consistent with the DMCA so Whip Media did not agree to pay, Inman claims. ""Despite Whip Media having complied with the DMCA and explaining that to Apple, the complainant notified Apple that its claim was 'unresolved,' and Apple decided to remove TV Time from the App Store,"" he says. The company has since resolved the matter with the complainant. As of the time of writing, the TV Time app was in the process of returning to the App Store. However, Inman warns this is another case where Apple had too much power over the companies doing business on its App Store platform. ""Apple holds significant power over app developers by controlling access to a massive market and, in this case, seems to have acted on a complaint without requiring robust evidence from the complainant,"" Inman shared with TechCrunch. Apple was asked for comment and did not respond. While TV Time was missing from the App Store, fans could use the app on Android and the web at app.tvtime.com. According to data from app intelligence firm Appfigures, TV Time has seen 7.4 million installs on iOS to date since Appfigures' tracking system began, on Jan. 1, 2017. (The app itself first launched in 2012).

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting NY Congestion Pricing Survived a Pause. Here’s What Could Kill It Virtually all of the lenders in KBW’s two main bank indexes reported that unrealized losses in their portfolios shrank in the third quarter. It’s the first time that has happened since the 2023 crunch that led to three of the four largest bank failures in the US, according to data compiled from company filings. As a group, the top 30 regionals reported a decrease of about 25% from the second quarter and a 44% improvement from a year earlier on losses for accumulated other comprehensive income, or AOCI in bank lingo. Figures were similar for the next tier of regional and community banks, with smaller but substantial improvements as a group for the nation’s six biggest money-center banks. The category can reflect changes in items such as derivatives, currency and pension obligations, but the bulk of AOCI deficits typically reflected unrealized bond losses. The improvement eases the threat from bonds that bankers bought back when interest rates were closer to zero. As rates jumped in 2022, the value of those securities tumbled because they were earning so little compared with newer issues. Drops in interest rates from the highs of 2023 have helped restore some of the lost value, according to bankers. The unrealized losses were only on paper, but they became very real for some banks when depositors made withdrawals en masse in search of higher yields from safer sources. To pay off those customers, some lenders had to sell bonds at depressed prices. Although money-center banks were largely unshaken by their AOCI deficits, analysts and regulators had been concerned that 10 straight quarters of high unrealized losses might leave more regional and community banks vulnerable to shocks. This prospect has faded along with the decline in interest rates, and because those bonds are now a year closer to maturity, when the proceeds can be reinvested and produce more income. Some lenders like KeyCorp have hustled the process along by unloading a portion of their losers while bond prices were rallying. The Cleveland-based lender said in September it sold about $7 billion of low-coupon investment securities that had yielded about 2.3%. KeyCorp took an after-tax loss of $737 million, but the sale helped to chop AOCI in half from year-earlier levels, and the bank has said it expects to sell a similar amount in the near future. Meanwhile, the reinvested proceeds from the first batch should add $40 million to the fourth quarter’s net interest income. “We felt very good about that repositioning,” Chief Financial Officer Clark H. I. Khayat told investors during the third-quarter earnings call. “That will aid us going forward.” At least one bank, Seattle-based Washington Federal parent WaFd Inc., is showing a positive number overall for AOCI. Chief Executive Officer Brent Beardall credits decisions that the company made in March 2020 to do the opposite of what its peers were doing. For example, it locked in $1 billion of liabilities for 10 years at 0.65% instead of getting stuck with long-term assets at similarly low rates. It also used derivatives to counter what would have been a floating-rate liability. “In hindsight,” Beardall said via email, “the biggest thing we did right was to zig when others were zagging.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Jaylen Brown Is Taking On Nike With $200 Sneakers Trump’s Impossible Task: Delivering for the Working Class and Billionaires Trump and the Triumph of America’s New Elite Wall Street Is Too Pumped About Trump to Worry About His Policies Companies With Immigrant Workforces Are Preparing for Raids ©2024 Bloomberg L.P."," (Bloomberg) -- US banks made in sure the paper losses that piled up during last year’s industry never become real ones.

48,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/chinese-lab-released-reasoning-ai-163333354.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 8:33 AM"," A Chinese lab has unveiled what appears to be one of the first ""reasoning"" AI models to rival OpenAI's o1. On Wednesday, DeepSeek, an AI research company funded by quantitative traders, released a preview of DeepSeek-R1, which the firm claims is a reasoning model competitive with o1. Unlike most models, reasoning models effectively fact-check themselves by spending more time considering a question or query. This helps them avoid some of the pitfalls that normally trip up models. Similar to o1, DeepSeek-R1 reasons through tasks, planning ahead and performing a series of actions that help the model arrive at an answer. This can take a while. Like o1, depending on the complexity of the question, DeepSeek-R1 might ""think"" for tens of seconds before answering. DeepSeek claims that DeepSeek-R1 (or DeepSeek-R1-Lite-Preview, to be precise) performs on par with OpenAI's o1-preview model on two popular AI benchmarks, AIME and MATH. AIME uses other AI models to evaluate a model's performance, while MATH is a collection of word problems. But the model isn't perfect. Some commentators on X noted that DeepSeek-R1 struggles with tic-tac-toe and other logic problems. (O1 does, too.) DeepSeek can also be easily jailbroken — that is, prompted in such a way that it ignores safeguards. One X user got the model to give a detailed meth recipe. And DeepSeek-R1 appears to block queries deemed too politically sensitive. In our testing, the model refused to answer questions about Chinese leader Xi Jinping, Tiananmen Square, and the geopolitical implications of China invading Taiwan. The behavior is likely the result of pressure from the Chinese government on AI projects in the region. Models in China must undergo benchmarking by China’s internet regulator to ensure their responses ""embody core socialist values."" Reportedly, the government has gone so far as to propose a blacklist of sources that can’t be used to train models — the result being that many Chinese AI systems decline to respond to topics that might raise the ire of regulators. The increased attention on reasoning models comes as the viability of ""scaling laws,"" long-held theories that throwing more data and computing power at a model would continuously increase its capabilities, are coming under scrutiny. A flurry of press reports suggest that models from major AI labs including OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic aren't improving as dramatically as they once did. That's led to a scramble for new AI approaches, architectures, and development techniques. One is test-time compute, which underpins models like o1 and DeepSeek-R1. Also known as inference compute, test-time compute essentially gives models extra processing time to complete tasks. ""We are seeing the emergence of a new scaling law,"" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said this week during a keynote at Microsoft's Ignite conference, referencing test-time compute. DeepSeek, which says that it plans to open source DeepSeek-R1 and release an API, is a curious operation. It's backed by High-Flyer Capital Management, a Chinese quantitative hedge fund that uses AI to inform its trading decisions. One of DeepSeek's first models, a general-purpose text- and image-analyzing model called DeepSeek-V2, forced competitors like ByteDance, Baidu, and Alibaba to cut the usage prices for some of their models — and make others completely free. High-Flyer builds its own server clusters for model training, the most recent of which reportedly has 10,000 Nvidia A100 GPUs and cost 1 billion yen (~$138 million). Founded by Liang Wenfeng, a computer science graduate, High-Flyer aims to achieve ""superintelligent"" AI through its DeepSeek org.

A neutral policy position is one that neither stimulates nor restricts economic activity. After lowering interest rates at each of their last two meetings, Fed officials will issue their next policy decision following their gathering Dec. 17-18. Investors have dialed back expectations for another rate reduction at that meeting, given firm inflation data and a string of comments from policymakers arguing the Fed should proceed with future adjustments with caution. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week that the economy is not sending signals that officials need to be in a hurry to reduce rates. Cook said Wednesday there had been “significant progress” on disinflation, but that elevated core inflation — which strips out the volatile categories of food and energy — “suggests that we have further to go before credibly achieving our inflation target of 2%.” “Although most price indicators suggest that progress is ongoing, I anticipate bumps along the road,” she said. She said she estimates both overall and core inflation falling to 2.2% next year, with her confidence in continued disinflation further reinforced by a moderation in wage growth. Labor Market Meanwhile, Cook described the jobs landscape as solid. The labor market has cooled during 2024, with a decline in job openings and an uptick in unemployment. Regardless, levels of joblessness and layoffs remain low overall. “The labor market is in a good position — with the supply and demand for workers being roughly in balance — such that it is no longer a source of inflationary pressure in the economy,” Cook said. She added downside risks to employment have “diminished somewhat” recently. Still, she said national job growth is “perhaps not quite strong enough to keep unemployment at the current low rate.” Cook also laid out potential scenarios for the Fed’s policy path moving forward. She said if the the labor market and inflation continue to progress in line with her forecasts, it could be appropriate to lower rates “over time until we near the neutral rate of interest.” “However, if inflation progress slows and the labor market remains solid, I could see a scenario where we pause along the downward path,” she said. “Alternatively, should the labor market weaken in a substantial way, it could be appropriate to ease policy more quickly.” Fed officials will release fresh projections for the economy and the path for interest rates following their December meeting.

50,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/forget-driverless-cars-one-company-051036077.html,"Tue, Nov 19, 2024, 5:49 AM"," HENNIKER, N.H. (AP) — When Hector Xu was learning to fly a helicopter in college, he recalled having a few “nasty experiences” while trying to navigate at night. The heart-stopping flights led to his research of unmanned aircraft systems while getting his doctorate degree in aerospace engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Then, he formed Rotor Technologies in 2021 to develop unmanned helicopters. Rotor has built two autonomous Sprayhawks and aims to have as many as 20 ready for market next year. The company also is developing helicopters that would carry cargo in disaster zones and to offshore oil rigs. The helicopter could also be used to fight wildfires. For now, Rotor is focused on the agriculture sector, which has embraced automation with drones but sees unmanned helicopters as a better way to spray larger areas with pesticides and fertilizers. On Wednesday, Rotor plans to conduct a public flight test with its Sprayhawk at an agriculture aviation trade show in Texas. “People would call us up and say, ‘hey, I want to use this for crop dusting, can I?’ We’d say, OK maybe,” Xu said, adding that they got enough calls to realize it was a huge untapped market. The Associated Press reporters were the first people outside the company to witness a test flight of the Sprayhawk. It hovered, flew forward and sprayed the tarmac before landing. Rotor's nearly $1 million Sprayhawk helicopter is a Robinson R44, but the four seats have been replaced with flight computers and communications systems allowing it be operated remotely. It has five cameras as well as laser-sensing technology and a radar altimeter that make terrain reading more accurate along with GPS and motion sensors. At the company's hangar in Nashua, New Hampshire, Xu said this technology means there is better visibility of terrain at night. One of the big draws of automation in agriculture aviation is safety. Because crop dusters fly at around 150 mph (240 kph) and only about 10 feet (3 meters) off the ground, there are dozens of accidents each year when planes collide with power lines, cell towers and other planes. Older, poorly maintained planes and pilot fatigue contribute to accidents. A 2014 report from the National Transportation Safety Board found there were more than 800 agriculture operation accidents between 2001 and 2010 including 81 that were fatal. A separate report from the National Agriculture Aviation Association found nearly 640 accidents from 2014 until this month with 109 fatalities. “It is a very, very dangerous, profession and there are multiple fatalities every year,” said Dan Martin, a research engineer with the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agriculture Research Service. “They make all their money in those short few months so sometimes it may mean that they fly 10 to 12 hours a day or more.” Job hazards also include exposure to chemicals. In recent years, safety concerns and the cheaper cost has led to a proliferation of drones flying above farmers' fields, Martin said, adding that some 10,000 will likely be sold this year alone. “It's growing exponentially as a market, super fast,” Martin said. But the size of the drones and their limited battery power means they only can cover a fraction of the area of a plane and helicopters. That is providing an opening for companies building bigger unmanned aircraft like Rotor and another company Pyka. California-based Pyka announced in August that it had sold its first autonomous electric aircraft for crop protection to a customer in the United States. Pyka's Pelican Spray, a fixed-wing aircraft, received FAA approval last year to fly commercially for crop protection. The company also sold its Pelican Spray to Dole for use in Honduras and to the Brazilian company, SLC Agrícola. Lukas Koch, chief technology officer at Heinen Brothers Agra Services, the company which bought the Pelican Spray in August, has called unmanned aircraft part of a coming “revolution,"" that will save farmers money and improve safety. The Kansas-based company operates out of airports from Texas to Illinois. Koch doesn't envision the unmanned aircraft replacing all the the company's dozens of pilots but rather taking over the riskiest jobs. “The biggest draw is taking the pilot out of the aircraft inside of those most dangerous situations,” Koch said. “There’s still fields that are surrounded by trees on all borders, or you’ve got big, large power lines or other just dangers, wind turbines, things like that. It can be tough to fly around.” But Koch acknowledges autonomous aviation systems could introduce new dangers to an already chaotic airspace — though that is less of a concern in rural areas with plenty of open space and fewer people. “Putting more systems into the air that don’t have a pilot inside could introduce new dangers to our current existing pilots and make their life even more dangerous,"" he said. “If you’ve got this full size helicopter flying beyond the line of sight, how is it going to react when it sees you? What is it going to do? ... That's a giant question mark, one that we take very seriously.” Companies like Rotor have incorporated built-in in contingencies should something go wrong — its helicopter features a half-dozen communications systems and, for now, a remote pilot in control. If the ground team loses contact with the helicopter, Rotor has a system which Xu referred to as a big, red button that ensures the engine can be shut off and the helicopter perform a controlled landing. “That means that we’ll never have an aircraft fly away event,"" he said. The safety measures will go a long way to helping the company receive what it expects will be FAA regulatory approval to fly its helicopters commercially. Once they have that, the challenge, as Xu sees it, will be scaling up to meet the demand in the United States but also Brazil which has a huge agriculture market but more relaxed regulatory environment. “I think 2025 will be production hell as Elon Musk calls it,” Xu said. “It’s kind of the difference between building a couple to building tens and hundreds at scale ... These are no longer just like bespoke Rolls-Royces. You want to be stamping these out like you would production automobiles."""," HENNIKER, N.H.

52,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/factbox-taxes-could-help-raise-152049630.html,"Tue, Nov 19, 2024, 7:20 AM"," BAKU (Reuters) - The COP29 climate talks in Azerbaijan aim to agree an annual finance target of $1 trillion or more a year to help poorer countries respond to global warming. Some see new taxes as one way to get there. The Global Solidarity Levies Task Force (GSLT), led by France, Barbados and Kenya, is exploring the issue. Below are extracts from its latest report on the options being discussed and estimates about how much could be raised. SHIPPING The levy that could be closest to being agreed is for shipping, responsible for around 3% of global emissions, with governments set to debate a series of measures at a meeting of the International Maritime Organization in April. Models for a levy include a Pacific islands and Caribbean proposal for a flat rate of $150/ton of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e), rising every five years, the GSLT said. The European Union and Japan favour a levy of $100/ton in 2027, while countries including Bahamas and Liberia have proposed an initial flat rate of about $18.75/ton. A levy of $150-300/ton could generate $127 billion a year in 2027-2030, the GSLT said, citing a study by U.N. Trade and Development. Revenue would fall to $103 billion in 2031-2040 and $36 billion in 2041-2050 as ships became less polluting. AVIATION Aviation accounts for 2% of global emissions yet is usually free of value-added tax (VAT) or sales taxes. Levies being discussed by the GSLT include kerosene fuel, private jet fuel, luxury tickets and frequent flyers, which together could generate $19 billion to $164 billion a year, it estimates. Around 29 countries already tax aviation fuel through excise duties, carbon levies or emission permits. The average price among G20 countries in 2021 was 9 euros ($9.50) per ton. Hurdles to a broader tax include ensuring a level playing field for industry players and overcoming legal barriers. At least 21 countries also already have some form of levy on airline tickets, at rates ranging from 2 euros in Portugal to almost 500 euros on some flights out of Britain, the GSLT said. FOSSIL FUELS Countries already impose levies on fossil fuels, including indirectly when gasoline is bought at the pump, through VAT, carbon taxes or emissions-trading schemes, or via royalties or taxes on oil companies. GSLT said revenues could be generated in future through a levy on extraction or ""windfall"" taxes on energy company profits. A ""Climate Damages Tax"" of $5/ton extracted in 2024 would generate an estimated $216 billion, a Greenpeace report this year said. An ActionAid report said a 50% tax on the windfall profits of the biggest 14 fossil fuel companies by market value in the two years to July 2023 would have generated around $173 billion. FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS More than 30 countries have some form of levy on financial transactions including Britain, France, Italy and Spain although agreeing a cross-border levy has proved tough. The Austrian Institute of Economic Research estimates a 0.1% levy on trading stocks and bonds and a 0.01% rate on derivatives trades globally could raise $238 billion to $419 billion a year. CARBON The GSLT says there are currently 75 carbon pricing mechanisms across 83 jurisdictions, of which 36 are structured as emissions trading systems (ETS) and 39 as carbon taxes. In total, they cover 24% of global emissions. But most are priced more cheaply than the $40-$80 a ton needed to keep the world on track to rein in global warming, due to political concern about the impact on households and businesses. A plan proposed by the International Monetary Fund would see countries agree a minimum price of $50 a ton, or of $25, $50 and $75 a ton varying with the stage of a country's development. The GSLT said another option could be to link up existing trading schemes. WEALTH The Group of 20 largest economies this year discussed whether to raise taxes on the super-rich. A report backed by current G20 leader Brazil proposed a global minimum tax of 2% of wealth for the world's roughly 3,000 dollar-billionaires, to raise about $250 billion a year. Other options could include changing the threshold at which the tax kicks in and the rate at which it is applied. CRYPTO Cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin are created by computation power driven by energy usage that creates emissions. In 2022, Kazakhstan moved to charge crypto miners between 1 and 25 Tenge ($0.002-0.056) per kilowatt-hour, the GSLT said. A global tax on electricity use of $0.045 per kWh could raise $5.2 billion, the IMF has estimated. A levy on crypto trading at 0.1% could raise $15.8 billion while a capital gains tax of 20% could raise up to $323 billion, IMF research shows. PLASTICS Countries are set to meet in South Korea next week to agree a deal on reining in plastics pollution, with Ghana and others calling for a levy on producers of virgin plastic polymers. A fee of $60-90 per tonne on primary polymer production could raise $25-35 billion a year, the GSLT said, citing analysis from Australian non-profit the Minderoo Foundation.

The appointment comes after Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba pledged more than ¥10 trillion ($65 billion) of fresh public support for Japan’s semiconductor and artificial intelligence sectors. Those outlays are in addition to the roughly ¥4 trillion Japan has secured for the industries in the last three extra budgets, including ¥920 billion for Rapidus Corp. in Hokkaido, according to the industry ministry. Rapidus aims to mass produce advanced logic chips by 2027. “Semiconductors can be a choke point for future industries, and we shouldn’t be wondering whether Rapidus will be able to win or not,” Yoshihiro Seki, secretary general of the LDP group, said to reporters on Tuesday. “We have to make it succeed and win no matter what.” The LDP group is likely to press ahead with legislation needed to enable the new funding mechanism in a regular parliamentary session next year. The LDP and its coalition partner Komeito lost their majority in last month’s election and they now need support from opposition parties to implement their policy measures. Yamagiwa resigned from his ministerial post in 2022 due to alleged ties to the Unification Church, a group whose influence in Japan came under fire following the assassination of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Yamagiwa’s website says he has severed those ties.

54,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-rivals-focus-building-different-160628308.html,"Tue, Nov 19, 2024, 8:06 AM"," SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) — Building the current crop of artificial intelligence chatbots has relied on specialized computer chips pioneered by Nvidia, which cornered the market and made itself the poster child of the AI boom. But the same qualities that make those graphics processor chips, or GPUs, so effective at creating powerful AI systems from scratch make them less efficient at putting AI products to work. That's opened up the AI chip industry to rivals who think they can compete with Nvidia in selling so-called AI inference chips that are more attuned to the day-to-day running of AI tools and designed to reduce some of the huge computing costs of generative AI. “These companies are seeing opportunity for that kind of specialized hardware,” said Jacob Feldgoise, an analyst at Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology. “The broader the adoption of these models, the more compute will be needed for inference and the more demand there will be for inference chips.” What is AI inference? It takes a lot of computing power to make an AI chatbot. It starts with a process called training or pretraining — the “P” in ChatGPT — that involves AI systems “learning” from the patterns of huge troves of data. GPUs are good at doing that work because they can run many calculations at a time on a network of devices in communication with each other. However, once trained, a generative AI tool still needs chips to do the work — such as when you ask a chatbot to compose a document or generate an image. That's where inferencing comes in. A trained AI model must take in new information and make inferences from what it already knows to produce a response. GPUs can do that work, too. But it can be a bit like taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut. “With training, you’re doing a lot heavier, a lot more work. With inferencing, that’s a lighter weight,” said Forrester analyst Alvin Nguyen. That's led startups like Cerebras, Groq and d-Matrix as well as Nvidia's traditional chipmaking rivals — such as AMD and Intel — to pitch more inference-friendly chips as Nvidia focuses on meeting the huge demand from bigger tech companies for its higher-end hardware. Inside an AI inference chip lab D-Matrix, which is launching its first product this week, was founded in 2019 — a bit late to the AI chip game, as CEO Sid Sheth explained during a recent interview at the company’s headquarters in Santa Clara, California, the same Silicon Valley city that's also home to AMD, Intel and Nvidia. “There were already 100-plus companies. So when we went out there, the first reaction we got was ‘you’re too late,’” he said. The pandemic's arrival six months later didn't help as the tech industry pivoted to a focus on software to serve remote work. Now, however, Sheth sees a big market in AI inferencing, comparing that later stage of machine learning to how human beings apply the knowledge they acquired in school. “We spent the first 20 years of our lives going to school, educating ourselves. That’s training, right?” he said. “And then the next 40 years of your life, you kind of go out there and apply that knowledge — and then you get rewarded for being efficient.” The product, called Corsair, consists of two chips with four chiplets each, made by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company — the same manufacturer of most of Nvidia's chips — and packaged together in a way that helps to keep them cool. The chips are designed in Santa Clara, assembled in Taiwan and then tested back in California. Testing is a long process and can take six months — if anything is off, it can be sent back to Taiwan. D-Matrix workers were doing final testing on the chips during a recent visit to a laboratory with blue metal desks covered with cables, motherboards and computers, with a cold server room next door. Who wants AI inference chips? While tech giants like Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft have been gobbling up the supply of costly GPUs in a race to outdo each other in AI development, makers of AI inference chips are aiming for a broader clientele. Forrester's Nguyen said that could include Fortune 500 companies that want to make use of new generative AI technology without having to build their own AI infrastructure. Sheth said he expects a strong interest in AI video generation. “The dream of AI for a lot of these enterprise companies is you can use your own enterprise data,” Nguyen said. “Buying (AI inference chips) should be cheaper than buying the ultimate GPUs from Nvidia and others. But I think there’s going to be a learning curve in terms of integrating it.” Feldgoise said that, unlike training-focused chips, AI inference work prioritizes how fast a person will get a chatbot's response. He said another whole set of companies is developing AI hardware for inference that can run not just in big data centers but locally on desktop computers, laptops and phones. Why does this matter? Better-designed chips could bring down the huge costs of running AI to businesses. That could also affect the environmental and energy costs for everyone else. Sheth says the big concern right now is, “are we going to burn the planet down in our quest for what people call AGI — human-like intelligence?” It’s still fuzzy when AI might get to the point of artificial general intelligence — predictions range from a few years to decades. But, Sheth notes, only a handful of tech giants are on that quest. “But then what about the rest?” he said. “They cannot be put on the same path.” The other set of companies don’t want to use very large AI models — it’s too costly and uses too much energy. “I don’t know if people truly, really appreciate that inference is actually really going to be a much bigger opportunity than training. I don’t think they appreciate that. It’s still training that is really grabbing all the headlines,” Sheth said."," SANTA CLARA, Calif.

When T-Mobile detected the suspicious activity, it booted the hackers from its systems. The company detected reconnaissance activity aimed at reaching deeper layers of the network, but customer data wasn’t accessed because T-Mobile caught the intrusion at such an early stage, the people said. T-Mobile knows where the intruders entered its network and is highly confident the method used for access is gone, the people said. The attack shared some characteristics with intrusions by Salt Typhoon, a Chinese hacking group that has targeted US telecommunications networks in recent weeks. T-Mobile hasn’t identified the responsible party. The people couldn’t identify the hackers and didn’t say when the intrusion took place. US officials said last week that Chinese state-sponsored hackers perpetrated a “broad and significant cyber-espionage campaign” in which they breached multiple telecommunications companies to steal customer call records and compromise communications belonging to a “limited number” of people in government and politics. The hackers targeted Vice President Kamala Harris’ staff, President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance, as well as staffers for Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, according to Missouri Republican Senator Josh Hawley. “To the extent we know, they were successful perhaps in garnering at least some of the communications of these individuals and their staff,” Hawley said at a hearing Tuesday. China has denied the allegations, with Foreign Ministry spokesman Lin Jian saying last week that his nation had “no interest in interfering in other countries’ internal affairs through cyberspace.” “We also oppose spreading China-related disinformation due to political agenda,” he said at a regular press briefing in Beijing. The Wall Street Journal reported on Nov. 15 that Bellevue, Washington-based T-Mobile’s systems were among those hacked. The newspaper previously reported that AT&T Inc., Verizon Communications Inc. and Lumen Technologies Inc. were among those targeted in the Salt Typhoon campaign. A day later, a T-Mobile spokesperson confirmed that the company was among those breached by Chinese hackers. “We have not seen significant impacts to T-Mobile systems or data, and have no evidence of impacts to or exfiltration of any customer information,” the company said in an email. Cisco Systems Inc. routers were involved in the breaches at AT&T, according to a person familiar with the matter. The attackers manipulated settings to siphon off the information they wanted, the person said.

AI developers are increasingly pitching the next wave of generative AI chatbots as AI “agents” that can do more useful things on people's behalf. But the cost of building and running AI tools is so high that more investors are questioning whether the technology’s promise is overblown. Microsoft said last month that it's preparing for a world where “every organization will have a constellation of agents — ranging from simple prompt-and-response to fully autonomous.” Microsoft elaborated in a blog post Tuesday that such autonomous agents ""can operate around the clock to review and approve customer returns or go over shipping invoices to help businesses avoid costly supply-chain errors.” Microsoft's annual Ignite conference caters to its big business customers. The pivot toward so-called “agentic AI” comes as some users are seeing limits to the large language models behind chatbots like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini and Microsoft's own Copilot. Those systems work by predicting the most plausible next word in a sentence and are good at certain writing-based work tasks. But tech companies have been working to build AI tools that are better at longer-range planning and reasoning so they can access the web or control computers and perform tasks on their own on a user's behalf. Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff has criticized Microsoft's pivot. Salesforce also has its “Agentforce” service that uses AI in sales, marketing and other tasks. “Microsoft rebranding Copilot as ‘agents’? That’s panic mode,” Benioff said in a social media post last month. He went on to claim that Microsoft's flagship AI assistant, called Copilot, is “a flop” that is inaccurate and spills corporate data."," CHICAGO (AP) — Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is opening a company conference in Chicago with remarks that could set the stage for where it’s taking its artificial business.

The process starts Wednesday when US prosecutors are expected to submit a document in federal court outlining specific remedies after successfully arguing in a landmark trial that Google ran its search engine empire as an illegal monopoly. The DOJ is expected to ask Google's parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) to sell off its Chrome browser, according to a report in Bloomberg. The Wall Street Journal reported that divestments could include the Android mobile operating system if Google doesn't meet certain conditions. Prosecutors may also call for new data licensing requirements or an end to agreements that secure Google's search engine as a default on mobile devices and internet browsers. DOJ outlined a framework of options last month, but the filing Wednesday is expected to be a lot more specific about what it wants to happen. It will then be up to District of Columbia District Court Judge Amit Mehta, who sided with the DOJ’s monopoly argument, to decide what should happen next in a separate ""remedies"" phase of the trial that will likely start in 2025. A DOJ breakup request would be the latest of many aggressive signals sent to the tech world during a wide-ranging effort by the Biden administration to rein in what it views as anticompetitive behavior across a number of industries. The administration has already alleged anticompetitive conduct against tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN) and claimed that Microsoft's acquisition of gaming giant Activision Blizzard would create a gaming market monopoly. ""The DOJ continues to push a radical agenda that goes far beyond the legal issues in this case,"" Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google's vice president of regulatory affairs, told Yahoo Finance in an email. ""The government putting its thumb on the scale in these ways would harm consumers, developers and American technological leadership at precisely the moment it is most needed."" It is not yet known whether a new Trump administration would let all of those Big Tech antitrust cases continue. Some legal experts don't expect the crackdown to let up. After all, it was Trump's DOJ that initiated the antitrust suit against Google after it concluded the company used illegal tactics to monopolize search. But Trump in October also suggested that Google’s punishment could be accomplished without forcing it to sell off parts of its empire. ""What you can do without breaking it up is make sure it’s more fair,"" Trump said in an Oct. 15 interview. He described Google’s search engine as ""rigged"" and expressed concern that consequences for Google in the case could favor China. The proposal to carve up Google would be the first step from the Justice Department to break apart a tech empire since it tried to do so more than two decades ago with Microsoft (MSFT). That case resulted in a 2002 settlement that opened the door to broader competition in the internet browser software market. A DOJ request to divest part of Google’s empire isn’t surprising, according to Vanderbilt Law School associate dean for research Rebecca Allensworth, because ""it makes sense to ask for more than you are going to get."" But what she expects the judge to actually approve is data sharing as opposed to a spin-off of Chrome. ""We don’t know what the judge is going to impose yet,"" she told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday. Jean-Paul Schmetz, chief of ads for search engine provider Brave, said a spin-off of Chrome is not likely to achieve the government's goals. ""My opinion is that if you have a browser — Safari, Firefox, Brave, whatever — and you send traffic to Google, then you should be compensated in a nondiscriminatory manner,"" Schmetz said. ""At the moment,"" Schmetz added, ""you only get money if you promise to Google that you're not going to compete against them."" Judge Mehta has scheduled a remedies hearing to take place in April, and he has previously said he plans to issue a final ruling by August 2025. Google has promised to appeal. And Judge Mehta could hold off on any orders to alter Google's behavior while it challenges his ruling in D.C.’s Circuit Court of Appeals. The judge would lose the right to impose remedies if Google is found not to have broken the law on appeal. And even if Google fails and is ordered to change its behavior, Judge Mehta could later adjust his orders to better ensure competition is restored. What is not yet known is how Trump’s term, which starts Jan. 20, could alter how this case is resolved.

D-Matrix, which has raised more than $160 million in funding to date, including from Microsoft's venture capital arm, said early customers are testing sample chips, with full shipments expected to pick up next year. The Santa Clara, California company did not name any specific customers, but said Super Micro Computer will sell servers that can hold d-Matrix chips. D-Matrix aims to complement AI chip giants such as Nvidia, whose chips are used to train AI systems on huge amounts of data. Once the systems are trained, d-Matrix chips aim to handle huge numbers of requests from the end users of the systems, in a step called inference. D-Matrix's chip is specifically designed to help handle requests from a lot of users at once on a single chip, even as those users continue to ask the AI system for new responses or tweaks to a video that they've asked the system to generate. ""We are getting a lot of interest in video use cases where we have customers coming and saying, 'Hey, look, we want to generate videos, and we want a collection of users, all interacting with their own respective video,'"" said Sid Sheth, d-Martix's chief executive.

59,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/codecrafters-wants-challenge-seasoned-developers-170000413.html,"Tue, Nov 19, 2024, 3:18 PM"," There are plenty of online platforms for developers that help you learn new skills or get started with a new language, such as Codecademy, LeetCode, and CodeSignal. Some guide developers step by step through the process while teaching the basics, while others provide detailed video tutorials. Codecrafters is a platform that doesn't want to show developer videos or hold their hands when they're learning new languages. Instead, it wants to provide tough challenges for advanced developers to build a project, master a programming language, and learn other concepts along the way. The Y Combinator-backed startup was built by Sarup Banskota and Paul Kuruvilla in 2022. The pair met during IIT prep school in Chennai. After completing university, Kuruvilla became a manager at the company where he worked and set himself the challenge of building a Redis clone from scratch — Redis is an open source data structure store — to upskill and motivate team members. He eventually made a workshop out of this experience and put it on a website with instructions. Banskota told TechCrunch this was essentially Codecrafters v0, but for Kuruvilla's workshops. After Banskota quit his job at Vercel, the duo started to build Codecrafters. They thought people would come to the site to learn the internals of Git, Docker, or Redis. But instead, people came to master a programming language. When the startup joined Y Combinator, it wasn't making money, and the duo had to tune the product for a better product-market fit. ""During the very first days of YC, advisors asked us about monetization. We added a pricing page on our site. But our users didn't like us as much when we started charging them. We had to build features to justify our monetization and make the journey of using the platform better during that time,"" Banskota said. The company has raised a $1.8 million seed round from notable individuals, including Instagram co-founder Mike Krieger, Dropbox co-founder Arash Ferdowsi, ex-Vercel COO Kevin Van Gundy, Supabase CEO Paul Copplestone, Basecase Capital's solo VC Alana Goyal, and PlanetScale co-founder Jitendra Vaidya. Krieger, who is now chief product officer at Anthropic, told TechCrunch over email that he has always picked up new skills by building projects. ""I find building software end to end to be a much more satisfying experience than just learning syntax. What I love about Codecrafters is that all the learning is grounded in building real things — the challenges, like building Redis or SQLite from scratch — both deepen students' understanding of the language they're studying but also of core concepts like distributed systems performance, and API design,"" he said. The core premise of Codecrafters is ""Build your own x"" projects, such as a BitTorrent client, Git, Redis, Docker, Shell, a text editor, and more. Once you create an account on Codecrafters, you get to choose from an array of these challenges. The platform has divided these challenges into different stages and assigned difficulty levels against those stages, along with the details of how the project would work. You can select a programming language of your choice for that project and also choose your proficiency with that language. If you are a beginner, the platform points you to a resource where you can get started and come back to attempt the challenge when you are better versed in the language. After the initial setup, Codecrafters builds a repository for you, which you can clone to your system. The initial repository has code that is meant to get you started with the project. You can use a choice of your development environment (IDE) to build the project and commit code to the repository. Each stage comes with a page that explains the task, a discussion tab with comments and tips from other folks who attempted the challenge, some coding solutions for builders to compare the core logic, and concept explanations and resources. The company has also implemented an AI chatbot that explains code solutions to users in the context of the stage. As for paid customers, the company offers a continuous integration (CI) layer so they can quickly test their code, get automated feedback, and keep working on the project. Developers can access challenges for free, but they will only get access to the content of the first two stages (or all stages for the project of the month). They can pay to access unlimited content, practice in anonymous mode, take advantage of the CI features and get priority support. Currently, Codecrafters offers a three-month plan for $120, an annual plan of $360, and a $990 lifetime plan. Currently, most of the people working with Codecrafters are contractors. The team is constantly creating new additions and extensions to current challenges and thinking about new challenges for coders. In addition to the bot that explains code, the company is also working on a feature to provide AI-powered hints to users. Banskota said that their advantage over other generalized chatbots is that the company trains models in the context of solutions for different challenges. ""Any chatbot will be able to tell you solutions for a code block or a problem. However, we have code submissions from different developers for the same problem. So we have an advantage of creating better contextual hints,"" he said. Codecrafters investor and former Vercel COO Kevin Van Gundy said that there are a lot of tools for beginners, but there aren't many companies building solutions for experienced devs to pick up new skills or capabilities. ""There are plenty of videos on YouTube, resources from like Khan Academy and MIT for people to learn. However, the interaction layer for developers is essential. It's important for platforms like Codecrafters to build incremental steps for developers to keep them engaged,"" he said. ""The platform enables developers to go through the process of building whole applications. Engineers who have gone through an entire problem set like that tend to be better builders."" Companies like OpenAI and Anthropic are building tools that generate code and help engineers automate some of their processes. Amid this, Krieger believes that high-level software design will be a sought-after skill. ""As LLMs continue to improve in their ability to both generate code and also help with agentic coding tasks that are more end-to-end, the skills that will be valued by employers (and useful to entrepreneurs) are the higher-level software design that Codecrafters teaches through its courses,"" he said."," There are plenty of online platforms for developers that help you learn new skills get started a new language, such Codecademy, LeetCode, and CodeSignal.

61,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/workbrew-makes-open-source-package-125600289.html,"Tue, Nov 19, 2024, 11:31 AM"," A trio of former GitHub executives and engineers have founded a new startup that brings the benefits of one of the most popular open source package managers to the enterprise. Workbrew, as the startup is called, emerges from stealth today with the mission of mitigating the risks of ""shadow IT"" practices, giving company admins and security teams centralized control and visibility into Homebrew deployments across the organization. To drive its commercial push, the startup has bagged $5 million in funding from developer-focused VC firm Heavybit, Essence VC, Operator Collective, and a slew of angels who include GitHub co-founder and ex-CEO, Tom Preston-Werner. Designed primarily for macOS, with support for Linux, Homebrew is a system-level, open source package manager that makes it easier for developers to install and maintain software libraries, command-line tools (CLI), and other utilities. Developers are, of course, free to manually install this software themselves, but it can be a time-consuming endeavor, particularly if a given package has numerous dependencies that are required for it to run properly. Homebrew does all of this with a single command, sourcing all the relevant components and keeping them up-to-date automatically, which is why Homebrew and its ilk are sometimes dubbed ""app stores for developers."" Still, this creates a headache for organizations that, while keen to keep their developers happy and productive, are also cognizant of the security and compliance risks of giving their workforce unfettered access to the world of open source software. That is where Workbrew comes into the picture. Founded in 2023, Workbrew is the handiwork of CEO John Britton (pictured above, right), COO Vanessa Gennarelli (pictured above, center), and CTO Mike McQuaid. Britton has contributed to Homebrew since 2014 and has held several senior roles at Big Tech companies, including as director of developer marketing at GitHub, while Gennarelli was most recently senior director at GitHub's education unit. McQuaid was formerly principal engineer at GitHub and is one of the longest-serving maintainers of the Homebrew project itself. ""We talked to companies of all sizes, from startups to large enterprises that are using Homebrew today, and we heard over and over again the same problem — as the number of devices increases in an organization, it's difficult to deploy Homebrew in a consistent way,"" Britton told TechCrunch. Providing support and services for popular open source tools is a tried-and-true model — it's what led IBM to dole out $34 billion for Red Hat, and countless startups have raised venture capital for products that enhance the utility of established community-driven projects. Homebrew is a good candidate to build services for, as it has become an insanely popular tool since its inception in 2009 and is now installed on tens of millions of devices globally — it's the gold standard for package management on macOS. But transforming Homebrew from a tool loved by developers to one that's enthusiastically embraced by teams is the challenge that Workbrew is focused on. ""Homebrew and its background serves individual developers — by choice, as an open source project run by volunteers,"" Gennarelli said. ""What John, Mike, and I noticed is the need to take it from single-player to multiplayer."" Workbrew essentially brings enterprise rigor to Homebrew deployments. It offers a free plan that doesn't enforce any kind of restrictions in terms of user or device limits, and admins can deploy Workbrew using any mobile device management (MDM) software. They can also access a fleet dashboard that shows data on devices, packages, licenses, and more, with support for basic vulnerability detection. Additionally, Workbrew also sports special integrations with MDM software such as Jamf, Kandji, Fleet, and SimpleMDM, which includes automated inventory synchronizing — information such as the device owner and name are always the same in Workbrew and the MDM console. This is served in a $10/month pro plan, which includes other features such as remote management, policy enforcement, and advanced security tooling. There's also an enterprise plan (with customized pricing) that offers service-level guarantees and ships with additional features, such as support for single sign-on (SSO) and data residency via custom deployments. Which plan a company prefers will really depend on its size and the industry it works in, as some will have greater security and compliance requirements than others. Even within companies, certain teams might have to adopt a different security posture. Workbrew said it has been designed to be flexible to these needs. Companies have the freedom to exert whatever level of access control they want, from highly restrictive all the way to an open-door philosophy, where no restrictions are actually enforced but the company has visibility and control if required. The controls can also be very specific — if a user attempts to install a crypto miner, for example, the admin can stipulate if it's blocked outright, an alert is sent, or a formal approval process initiates. In the most extreme case, a company can have a strict vetting policy, wherein every package a developer tries to install has to be scanned and recorded as part of an audit paper trail. This might be important for certain highly regulated industries with high compliance thresholds, where they may be required to show every single package that was installed on a specific device at a given time. ""The biggest thing that I hear over and over again from IT and security professionals is that they don't know what they don't know,"" Britton said. ""We make it easy for businesses to get a high-level overview of every single package installed, on every device across their entire fleet, including its version information and its vulnerabilities."" The fact that nobody has yet launched a commercial, enterprise-grade business off the back of Homebrew is something of a head-scratcher. The reasons for this, according to Britton, can be boiled down to three key factors that had to align at the right time to make it happen. ""The growth of the open source project was a necessary first step, and the second stage was really about Homebrew's structure as an open source project. Over the years, it has become more formalized, better taken care of, which has led to the point where it's now possible to do this,"" Britton said. Indeed, many open source projects are often maintained by a single individual or loose collective, with little in the way of formal structure. Homebrew, for its part, has its own governance, with a committee and elections to decide who will lead the project. This stability and structure make it easier to build a business on top, particularly when one of its founders — CTO Mike McQuaid — has been contributing to Homebrew from the beginning and leading the project since 2016. This feeds into the third key component that Britton feels has been necessary to make a business like Workbrew possible: The right people being available at the right time, with the right ideas. ""This team is the perfect team to build this. The three of us worked together for close to 10 years at GitHub doing developer tools,"" Britton said. ""I worked at Twilio before [Britton was employee number 13], Vanessa worked on Scratch [visual programming language from MIT], and Mike's been a contributor to Homebrew for 15 years. You need to have a very deep knowledge of how Homebrew works in order to solve these problems."" In fact, Britton and McQuaid had been discussing a potential business around Homebrew for the better part of a decade, and investors had also approached them at various junctures to see if they might want to build a business off Homebrew. But it never quite made sense, and McQuaid was also apprehensive about ruining a project that he'd put so much effort into. ""The project itself was not in a mature enough state. I'd been working on Homebrew for so many years, it's very important to me,"" McQuaid said. ""And the problem was, nobody really had any idea what the actual business was to be here."" But when their schedules aligned, Britton, Gennarelli, and McQuaid got together and forged a path for what would become Workbrew. They were determined that this wouldn't be some sort of ""open core"" business that would deplete the core project itself. It had to be about adding something to the mix that had hitherto been absent. ""Homebrew was in a good place with its own governance structure, and we could see what an actual business was here with a path to making a profitable company that is going to deliver a lot of value to people,"" McQuaid said. ""This is a separate entity — we are incredibly integrated with Homebrew; we use an unforked Homebrew, but we are not Homebrew. We are Workbrew."" Workbrew entered public beta this August, bringing in around 20 customers who include expenses management provider Emburse and big data serving engine Vespa, which was spun out of Yahoo. While incorporated in the U.S., the company is fully remote — its first employee, who was also one of the most active Homebrew maintainers, is based in the Shetland Islands off the coast of northern Scotland. With a fresh $5 million in the bank, Workbrew says it's planning to ""rapidly scale"" its platform and will build deeper integrations with MDM software and more ""developer-focused features."" All of this will depend on one thing: the continued support of the core open source project itself. It's always challenging to find funding for such community projects, and we've seen an uptick in various equity-free initiatives of late, spanning fellowships, grants, and pledges. Homebrew, for its part, has an annual budget of around $120,000 and has gotten by so far on donations through GitHub Sponsors and philanthropic efforts from big-name donors such as Airbnb and Bloomberg. That will have to continue for Workbrew to thrive. ""Homebrew is now this incredibly mature, sophisticated, and self-sustaining entity,"" Gennarelli said. ""For Workbrew to succeed depends on Homebrew — we have a vested interest in the project succeeding. Our goals are aligned, but we are completely distinct — one is a nonprofit, and we are a commercial entity."""," A of former executives and engineers have founded a new startup that brings the benefits of of the most popular open source package the enterprise.

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting NY Congestion Pricing Survived a Pause. Here’s What Could Kill It Utilities, which are racing to keep up with surging electricity demand to power AI data centers, have dethroned US banks as the biggest sellers of subordinated securities to big investors. Dominion Energy Inc., CenterPoint Energy Inc. and others have raised nearly $18 billion through sales in 2024, a ninefold jump from last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. More specifically, utilities are turning to hybrid bonds, an emerging category within the asset class. Part of the shift is being driven by a Moody’s Ratings methodology change whereby hybrids can be treated as half-debt and half-equity, so companies carry less debt on their balance sheet than if they had sold a regular bond. “There’s going to be more energy needed whether you’re talking about cars, whether you’re talking about data centers,” said Mark Lieb, a near five-decade veteran of preferred securities and chief executive officer at Spectrum Asset Management Inc. “You have all these different segments that seem to be converging together.” Power generators and infrastructure firms are bracing for electricity demand to outstrip supply during the next few years after a period of flat or shrinking consumption, with data centers accounting for the bulk of the increase, according to Bain & Co. Meeting these needs would require utilities to boost annual generation by as much as 26% by 2028, the consulting firm said. Capital expenditure is set to exceed $200 billion next year, almost double the amount of a decade ago, according to trade group Edison Electric Institute. For utilities faced with big financing needs, the change in Moody’s ratings methodology in February made hybrids more cost-effective to raise debt without risking rating downgrades. Companies could now classify 50% of capital raised through hybrids as equity, an increase from 25%, in addition to benefitting from deducting interest payments for tax purposes. Prior to the change, utilities would’ve generally issued preferred stocks, another category within subordinated securities that are usually sold by banks. Hybrid bonds that fit Moody’s criteria typically mature in 30 years and can be repaid five or 10 years after issuance. “It’s fascinating because utility capital expenditure is going through the roof, so they need to finance it,” said Andy DeVries, head of utilities at CreditSights Inc. “Right as capex is going up with the data centers, Moody’s comes with a gift from above.” For investors, hybrids can offer yields that rival the returns of junk-rated bonds, even though the instruments are usually issued by high-grade firms. These yields would help support further strong demand as investors look for investment opportunities in a lower Federal Reserve interest-rate environment, said Doug Baker, head of preferred securities at Nuveen. “We see potential for demand to actually increase, as that dynamic shifts away from investors parking in cash as the Fed cuts and looking to invest it in a better opportunity,” Baker said. “This is one of those areas where we would expect to see that cash to rotate into.” Hybrid bonds are still fairly new in the US, where the market is underdeveloped compared to Europe. They would typically also take losses ahead of other bonds if a company goes under. In Europe, for example, where perpetual hybrids are the widespread format, a funding crunch faced by Swedish real estate firm SBB prompted a selldown in the firm’s hybrid bonds to mere cents in the euro. Utilities are well-suited to raise funding through hybrids because the industry is mostly regulated, making firms’ performance fairly easy to predict, said Linus Claesson, a portfolio manager specializing in corporate hybrids at Neuberger Berman. Telecommunications companies and pipeline operators have the same profile, making these sectors suitable for participation too, he said. You “actually prefer to have fairly capital intensive businesses that are reliant on the public bond market to fund themselves,” Claesson said. “That means the reputational considerations, when it comes to using the optionality embedded in the instrument, becomes very relevant.” This year’s growth in hybrid supply is set to be only the beginning as power providers set the groundwork for the splurge that would be required for the AI era. The sector is also unlikely to encounter headwinds from a Donald Trump-led US administration, said Brittney D. Sandler, a senior associate at law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP. “Demand for data center capacity, resilient infrastructure, and advanced, scalable solutions will continue to grow,” said Sandler, who advises on corporate finance transactions. “Our clients are full speed ahead.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Jaylen Brown Is Taking On Nike With $200 Sneakers Trump’s Impossible Task: Delivering for the Working Class and Billionaires Wall Street Is Too Pumped About Trump to Worry About His Policies Companies With Immigrant Workforces Are Preparing for Raids Why Tech Billionaires Love the Author of Jurassic Park ©2024 Bloomberg L.P."," (Bloomberg) -- The artificial intelligence revolution is such an insatiable quest cash that it’s rewiring one section of US capital Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Parking Spaces With Trees New York’s Agency Approves $9 Congestion Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Cutting NY Congestion Pricing Survived a Pause.

The tech giant showed off a number of improvements to its Microsoft 365 Copilot platform, including new AI agents; said that it’s previewing the use of Nvidia’s (NVDA) Blackwell GB200-powered AI servers; and announced a slew of security upgrades for its systems. Shares of Microsoft were flat immediately following the announcements. The software behemoth also touted its customer growth in the AI space. Microsoft chief communications officer Frank Shaw noted in a statement that “nearly 70% of the Fortune 500 now use Microsoft 365 Copilot.” Microsoft, like its Big Tech rivals, is pouring billions of dollars into expanding its AI capabilities, and Wall Street is eager to see those investments pay off. Microsoft’s latest AI updates include what it calls Copilot Actions. Available in private preview, the feature can do things like provide users with summaries of their daily meetings or, more importantly, summaries of all the emails and notes they received while away on vacation. Doing away with the daylong pain of catching up on emails alone might just make Copilot Actions worthwhile. Microsoft is also going all in on AI agents. Think of AI agents as a more advanced version of an AI chatbot. Where chatbots can only respond to user prompts with text, AI agents are designed to perform automated tasks like taking meeting notes or, on the more advanced side, help companies process customer proposals and requests. New AI agents include Interpreter for Teams, which will translate voice conversations in real time with the option to simulate the sound of your voice, and Employee Self-Service Agent, which is meant to help workers find important answers to questions about HR or IT issues. The Windows maker also showed off its Azure AI Foundry software development kit (SDK), which is meant to help companies build and manage their own AI apps and agents, and the Azure AI Foundry Agent Service, which allows developers to put together AI agents to automate different business processes. In addition to software, Microsoft is making hardware moves with the debut of its Windows 365 Link. A small PC designed to access Microsoft’s cloud services, the Link will be available in April 2025 for $349. The company also said it’s previewing the use of Nvidia’s (NVDA) GB200 servers to provide customers with access to AI-optimized virtual machines and cloud-based computers that users can use to perform AI training and inferencing. Microsoft is one of a number of companies looking to get their hands on Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell chips, which power the GB200. By previewing the platform, Microsoft is a step closer to being able to offer the service to its customers. On the security front, Microsoft announced its new Microsoft Security Exposure Management platform. The software is designed to give cybersecurity experts a better overall look at how employee devices, files, and services come together and overlap, helping them understand how a hacker might be able to gain access to a business and move through its networks. The idea is that by giving cybersecurity workers a view into how attackers might try to access networks, the workers will be able to cut hackers off ahead of time or at least respond to threats more quickly. Microsoft says it’s also moving to improve the security of AI apps with its Data Loss Prevent for Microsoft 365 Copilot. The company says the feature will let customers see if AI prompts are pulling up sensitive data, prevent data risks, and provide information about how to respond to AI-related security incidents. Microsoft’s announcements come as the company is looking to fully monetize its AI investments over the last few years, including its stake in ChatGPT developer OpenAI. Microsoft reported better-than-expected Q1 earnings in October and said that AI contributed 12 points of growth to its Azure cloud business segment. Shares of Microsoft are up 12% over the last 12 months. Shares of rivals Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) are up 39% and 27%, respectively. Correction: The Windows 365 Link is priced at $349.

68,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-offers-100-million-undo-005235580.html,"Mon, Nov 18, 2024, 4:52 PM"," (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has increased its offer to invest in Indonesia by almost tenfold, according to people familiar with the matter, in the US tech giant’s latest bid to persuade the government to lift its sales ban on the iPhone 16. Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting NY Congestion Pricing Survived a Pause. Here’s What Could Kill It The proposal would see Cupertino-based Apple invest almost $100 million in Southeast Asia’s largest economy over two years, the people said, asking not to be identified because they’re not authorized to speak publicly. Apple’s previous investment plan of close to $10 million would have involved the company investing in a factory making accessories and components in the city of Bandung, located southeast of Jakarta, Bloomberg News reported earlier. After Apple submitted its increased offer, Indonesia’s Ministry of Industry, which last month blocked a permit allowing the sale of the iPhone 16, is now demanding that the technology behemoth alter its investment plans to focus more on research and development for its smartphones in the country, the people said. The Ministry of Industry hasn’t made a final decision on Apple’s newest proposal, they added. Following Apple’s initial proposal, the ministry called for senior company executives to meet Minister Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita. But after flying into Jakarta, Apple’s senior executives were told that the minister wasn’t available and so they had to meet with the ministry’s director-general instead. Apple and the Ministry of Industry didn’t respond to requests for comment. Apple’s new investment proposal came after the Ministry of Industry last month blocked sales of the iPhone 16 on the grounds the US company’s local unit hasn’t met a 40% domestic content requirement for smartphones and tablets. According to the Indonesian government, Apple has only invested 1.5 trillion rupiah ($95 million) in the nation via developer academies, falling short of a commitment of 1.7 trillion rupiah. The Southeast Asian nation has also banned the sale of Alphabet Inc.’s Google Pixel phones because of a similar lack of investment. Indonesia’s hardball tactics appear to be working, with the iPhone 16 ban becoming an example of the pressure new President Prabowo Subianto’s government is putting on international firms to increase local manufacturing as it seeks to boost domestic industries. Indonesia also resorted to such tactics under the administration of former President Joko Widodo, who blocked ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok last year to shield its retail sector from cheap Chinese-made goods. This prompted the hugely popular video app to ultimately invest $1.5 billion in a joint venture with Tokopedia, the e-commerce arm of Indonesia’s GoTo Group. By offering to invest in the country, Apple is seeking to get unfettered access to Indonesia’s 278 million consumers, more than half of which are under the age of 44 and tech savvy. But such strong-arm tactics by Indonesia risk frightening off other firms from scaling up their presence or establishing a footprint in the first place, particularly ones that are looking to decouple from China. It may also jeopardize Prabowo’s aim of attracting overseas investments to grow the economy and fund policy spending. It’s unclear as to which companies Apple’s proposed investment might go. Apple typically backs assembly or components partners such as Foxconn in various countries, which in turn help produce or supply vital parts for its iPhones and iPads.

73,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-traders-brace-potential-300-144244194.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 7:42 AM"," (Bloomberg) -- With Nvidia Corp. due to report an unusually complex quarter as the world’s most valuable company, traders are preparing for a potentially mammoth stock swing. Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting NY Congestion Pricing Survived a Pause. Here’s What Could Kill It The options-implied move for Nvidia shares the day after earnings is about 8% in either direction, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That would equate to close to a $300 billion swing in market value — bigger than all but 25 companies in the S&P 500 Index. And according to strategists at Bank of America, the report carries more risk for the benchmark than the next Federal Reserve meeting or inflation data. As the poster child of the artificial intelligence trade, Nvidia’s stock has rallied nearly 200% so far in 2024 and its reports have been the biggest event on the earnings calendar for more than a year. But the shares pulled back 1% ahead of the chipmaker’s fiscal third quarter earnings, due on Wednesday after the market close, and there’s more uncertainty than normal about how the results and guidance will play out. That’s because there are varying views on Wall Street about what to expect from the company’s newest product line, Blackwell. Nvidia has said that the new chips will contribute several billion dollars in revenue in the fiscal fourth quarter, while Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang described demand for the chips as “insane.” But production delays have made modeling supply — a notoriously difficult task — even harder. “There’s a big unknown around Blackwell capacity,” said Dan Eye, chief investment officer at Fort Pitt Capital Group. “The CEO has established a lot of credibility, but the bar is very high,” he said, adding that it will likely be challenging for Nvidia to give blowout guidance for next quarter. The questions around Blackwell have led to a wide spread in analyst expectations for the fiscal fourth quarter that ends in January. Consensus is at $37.1 billion — with the gap between the highest and lowest projections at more than $7 billion, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Nvidia typically provides revenue guidance for the upcoming quarter with its results. Part of the reason for the gap in analyst forecasts is that some expect customers to delay purchases of Blackwell’s predecessor products, called Hopper, in anticipation of the newer chips. That’s what Morgan Stanley analyst Joseph Moore is anticipating and why he’s calling Wednesday’s results a “transitional” quarter. Nvidia is likely to give a conservative forecast that’s only slightly ahead of the average analyst estimate, which should satisfy most investors as long as everything points to a very strong full-year Blackwell ramp, Moore wrote. Jim Worden, chief investment officer of Wealth Consulting Group, is also less concerned about the timing of Blackwell, with all signs pointing to strong demand. “I expect we’ll see a very good showing with Blackwell and how much it is shipping,” he said. “That trend should continue on into next year.” The chipmaker’s biggest customers, including Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc., all pledged in their most recent results to pump more into capital spending in the year ahead. However, with a history of beating estimates in a big way, thanks to unbridled demand for its accelerator chips, Nvidia may need to do more than provide assurances that Blackwell’s ramp up remains strong. In the past five quarters, Nvidia sales have beaten consensus by an average of about $1.8 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. If Nvidia results fall short of that bar, it could spell trouble for the stock, which is trading close to a record high after nearly tripling this year. “The stock could be volatile, even on a really good report,” Worden said. The market may be expecting perfection, “and to the extent it isn’t perfect, the stock could pull back.” Rick Bensignor, chief executive officer of Bensignor Investment Strategies and a former Morgan Stanley strategist, agrees. “It can’t just beat the consensus, but also the whisper-type numbers that people are looking for,” he said. “If it disappoints, we can easily see it come off 10% or so.” For the broader market, the implications of Nvidia’s results might not have been fully priced in, said Charlie McElligott, Nomura’s cross asset strategist at Nomura. Option straddles on the Invesco Nasdaq 100 ETF are only implying a 1.7% move for Thursday. “That maybe ‘feels’ light,” McElligott wrote.

SpaceX achieved new feats during the sixth major test launch of its Starship system but nixed an eagerly anticipated midair “catch” of the rocket’s booster as President-elect Donald Trump looked on in South Texas.

Brent crude futures for January were down 1 cent, or 0.01%, at $73.30 a barrel by 12:19 p.m. ET (1719 GMT). U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures for December, due to expire on Wednesday, were up 17 cents, or 0.24%, at $69.56, while the more active WTI contract for January was up 5 cents, or 0.07%, at $69.29. The intensifying war between Russia and Ukraine and subsequent concern around potential oil supply disruptions have helped keep a floor under prices this week. ""These risks to supply are definitely keeping the support here and offsetting to a degree concerns around the global demand outlook,"" said John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital in New York. Ukraine fired a volley of British Storm Shadow cruise missiles into Russia on Wednesday, the latest new Western weapon it has been permitted to use on Russian targets a day after it fired U.S. ATACMS missiles. This has put geopolitical risk back in the market, StoneX energy analyst Alex Hodes said in a note on Wednesday. ""However, the concerns over additional sanctions or disruptions of Russian fuel or crude oil supplies appear misguided,"" Hodes added, pointing to strong Russian fuel exports. Long positions in WTI have declined significantly despite the added geopolitical risk, according to Aegis Hedging associate Christian Drolshagen, with hedge funds holding only 50% of summer levels, per CFTC data. Elsewhere, the U.S. vetoed a U.N. Security Council resolution for a ceasefire in Gaza on Wednesday, buoying oil prices' war risk premium on investors concerns around potential disruptions to global oil supplies as war in the Middle East continues. ""The market is very nervous something could happen with another escalation between the Israelis and Iranians,"" said Again Capital's Kilduff. ""Everyone is focused on Trump and U.S. producers being let loose, but the flip side of that is that sanctions are definitely back in the market as far as what happens next with Iranian supplies and its ability to export,"" he added. Offsetting some support from supply concerns on Wednesday, U.S. crude and gasoline stocks rose by more than expected last week, according to data from the Energy Information Administration. Elsewhere, Norway's Equinor said it had restored full output capacity at the Johan Sverdrup oilfield in the North Sea following a power outage. Equinor last month said the field was producing at peak capacity of around 755,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Reserve will trim interest rates next month but make shallower cuts in 2025 than expected just a month ago due to the risk of higher inflation from President-elect Donald Trump's proposed policies, according to most economists in a Reuters poll. Higher interest rates increase the cost of borrowing, which can slow economic activity and dampen demand for oil.

He was told to do so by StoneX management, both during his recruitment and after the firm hired him, he alleged in an affidavit seen by Bloomberg News. “Like others, I smuggled code out of BTIG in ways carefully designed to avoid detection by BTIG’s security and compliance monitoring,” Pfeuffer said in the affidavit. “StoneX’s management instructed us to copy code, product designs, and whatever else was needed so that we could avoid the years it would otherwise take to build StoneX’s systems and products from scratch.” Pfeuffer’s revelation comes amid an ongoing dispute between the two firms. BTIG had sued StoneX for at least $200 million in compensation alleging it pilfered code to build its own market-making business. BTIG claimed that StoneX recruited several of its key traders and software developers, some of whom took the stolen code with them to StoneX under the instruction of senior executives. The lawsuit has since moved to arbitration — a private method of resolving disagreements. Bitter battles involving accusations of trade secret theft are proliferating, as financial firms increasingly rely on algorithms and technology to gain an edge. Citadel Securities sued a pair of former employees alleging they stole trade secrets last year after they broke off to form a crypto market-making firm — a claim that firm denies. Jane Street Group accused former traders of taking confidential trading strategy to new jobs at Izzy Englander’s Millennium Management, which they also deny. In the affidavit, Pfeuffer said StoneX’s management encouraged him to enlist additional colleagues from BTIG despite knowing this violated non-compete agreements. At StoneX, Pfeuffer’s team was under “enormous pressure” to use stolen BTIG intellectual property to modernize its lagging technology, after the firm made unrealistic promises to shareholders that it could deliver automated trading systems within a year, Pfeuffer said. StoneX’s senior executives — including StoneX Financial Chief Executive Officer Charles Lyon, its head of equities Jacob Rappaport, head of equity trading Thomas Moore and managing director Chris Amato — were “intimately involved” in these activities, Pfeuffer alleged in the affidavit, dated Oct. 9 and submitted in the arbitration. Lawyers representing both StoneX and those executives said in an emailed statement that the affidavit contains misstatements, misrepresentations and speculation. It also contradicts a statement signed by Pfeuffer in 2021 which was filed in a California court as an exhibit in the lawsuit, the lawyers said. In that document, Pfeuffer denied possessing BTIG code and providing it to StoneX. “We will continue to vigorously defend against BTIG’s baseless allegations against the company and its executives,” the lawyers said. Pfeuffer was placed on leave by StoneX in January, he said in the affidavit. He no longer works at the firm, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified discussing private information. Steven Kalar, the lawyer representing Pfeuffer in the matter, declined to comment on the affidavit and declined to give a reason for Pfeuffer’s admission. Representatives for BTIG also declined to comment. Aggressive Recruitment Pfeuffer joined StoneX in early February 2021, days after resigning from BTIG. His appointment followed a months-long recruitment process which involved multiple calls with senior management and the promise of millions of dollars in bonuses, he said in the affidavit. Pfeuffer said he got a “very aggressive pitch” from Amato, who also previously worked at BTIG. Pfeuffer told Amato that if he jumped ship, he wanted to bring his BTIG partner, Debayan Bhaduri, with him. Pfeuffer said Bhaduri had extensive knowledge of the order-management system StoneX was using — the digital tool that executes and tracks securities orders. Both were unhappy at BTIG at that time over their expected compensation, according to Pfeuffer. In one instance in December 2020, Pfeuffer and Bhaduri flew to meet StoneX executives including Lyon, Moore and Rappaport in Winter Park, Florida — where it has an office — to discuss moving to the firm and ways to upgrade its systems. The executives encouraged them to recruit additional BTIG employees, but only after a lull to avoid the appearance of solicitation, according to Pfeuffer. He was promised a $300,000 base salary with a $200,000 bonus during his first year, but was told such incentives could surpass $2 million if the StoneX systems were successful. Once at StoneX, Pfeuffer said he and colleagues faced deadlines to build new automated trading systems that were “completely unrealistic” without using information from previous employers. StoneX management made it clear that if staff remembered something from prior employment, they could use it at StoneX. Amato made comments about “coding from memory,” which employees understood to mean cribbing such ideas, Pfeuffer said. An attorney for Amato declined to comment on pending litigation. Complaints, Lawsuits In BTIG’s lawsuit, which it filed against StoneX in November last year, it alleged the firm stole code and poached BTIG executives. In a May filing, StoneX said it would “vigorously defend itself” against the claims. At that time, StoneX also disclosed that the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission were investigating the firm for conduct alleged in BTIG’s complaint. Pfeuffer’s affidavit was also submitted as part of that process, according to the people familiar with the matter. A representative for the SEC said the agency doesn’t comment on investigations or the existence of them. A representative for the Justice Department declined to comment. In addition to StoneX, BTIG has brought claims against a number of individuals including former BTIG employees Amato and Bhaduri. Its complaints against Amato and Bhaduri, filed in June in Chicago and New York federal courts, claim the individuals were key perpetrators of what it called “one of the greatest financial-industry trade secret frauds in recent history.” The parties agreed to arbitrate before the defendants were due to publicly respond. BTIG has not brought claims against Pfeuffer, according to the people familiar with the matter. Amato recruited a team of BTIG executives to steal the code, BTIG alleged, while Bhaduri used stolen code to build new automated market-making and trading tools, according to the complaints against them. In his affidavit, Pfeuffer said that Bhaduri discussed the possibility of fleeing the US for India to avoid prosecution. “Mr. Bhaduri categorically denies ever taking trade secrets from BTIG, and he also categorically denies talking about fleeing to India or expressing concern about being arrested for taking information from BTIG,” David Axelrod, a lawyer for Bhaduri, said in an emailed statement. ‘Perfected’ Method Pfeuffer said he had “perfected” his method for inconspicuously stealing code while he worked at BTIG, which he had joined in 2015. First, he would manually type out encryption software on BTIG’s code-development servers and use that software to encrypt the code he wanted to remove. The measures made it appear “as meaningless gobbledy-gook,” he said. He then appended the encrypted code to an “innocent looking” PDF he had saved to BTIG’s servers before ultimately emailing it to his personal Gmail account. “I realize that what I did was wrong and am very remorseful for my conduct,” he said. --With assistance from Ava Benny-Morrison, Lydia Beyoud, Nicola M.

Cherney SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft has designed two additional infrastructure chips for its data centers that will help speed artificial intelligence operations and increase data security, it said on Tuesday at its Ignite conference. Microsoft has devoted significant resources to develop home-grown silicon for general purpose applications and artificial intelligence. Like rivals Amazon.com and Google, Microsoft's engineers say there is a performance and price benefit to designing chips that are customized for its needs. Designing custom chips can reduce Microsoft's reliance on processors made by Intel and Nvidia. Microsoft's two new chips are designed to be installed deep within the company's data center infrastructure. One chip is designed to increase security and the other is for data processing. The company makes the effort to design an array of data center processors because it aims to ""optimize every layer of infrastructure"" and ensures that Microsoft's data centers crunch information at the speed AI requires, said Rani Borkar, corporate vice president, Azure Hardware Systems and Infrastructure Engineers will install the new security chip called the Azure Integrated HSM in every new server destined for a data center beginning next year. The chip aims to keep crucial encryption and other security data inside the security module.

The mainland stock has outperformed SMIC’s Hong Kong shares by almost 50 percentage points, underscoring stronger demand from onshore Chinese investors. Expectations for Donald Trump’s presidency have pumped up shares of SMIC and local peers as beneficiaries of China’s drive to localize manufacturing. Some analysts and fund managers caution that the stocks now look expensive, while China’s chip industry faces ongoing issues of economic malaise and restricted access to crucial technologies. “There is a lot of speculative buying and the trading is based on news events instead of fundamentals,” so volatility should be expected, said Xiang Xiaotian, a director at Shanghai Chengzhou Investment Management Co. “The main trading thesis is domestic substitution as Chinese companies will need to turn to local chipmakers.” China has been outspending other nations on chips as it struggles to narrow the wide technology gap with Western nations. Expected benefits from Beijing’s latest pledges of stimulus have served as an additional catalyst for SMIC and domestic peers including Hua Hong Semiconductor Ltd., whose onshore shares are up 78% from their September low. SMIC forecast higher-than-expected sales growth for this quarter as its competitive prices lured local chip designers, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. More broadly, China foundries “bottomed out earlier” than other global manufacturers of less-advanced chips, Counterpoint Research wrote in a note in August. Even if demand for these so-called legacy semiconductors used in auto and industrial applications improves, however, China remains far behind in AI and other advanced areas due to US-led restrictions that prevent it from acquiring the most advanced manufacturing equipment. For example, Huawei Technologies Co.’s ambitions to create more powerful chips have hit major snags because of US sanctions, people familiar with the matter said. “Artificial intelligence is a small blessing for SMIC and Hua Hong,” Morningstar Inc. analyst Phelix Lee wrote in a report. The pair may not be moving quickly enough to capture demand for high-end power chips used in data centers, he said, adding that if Chinese AI startups lose access to advanced processors that would also hurt demand for peripheral chips supplied by SMIC and Hua Hong. Meanwhile, SMIC’s outsized share-price gain is likely to drive increased scrutiny of its earnings and other metrics. Some observers also note the potential for rivals such as TSMC to lower prices for making legacy chips, putting pressure on SMIC’s pricing power. “We acknowledge the stronger localization demand and gross margin sustainability of SMIC,” Morgan Stanley analysts including Charlie Chan wrote in a note. “However, we believe the competition from foundries may get more intense in 2025. In addition, SMIC’s trading valuation does not look attractive to us.” The Hong Kong-listed stock is trading at a forward price-to-book ratio of 1.2 times, above its three-year average level of 0.9 times. Valuation based on book value is seen as more useful than earnings-based multiples for evaluating asset-heavy, cyclical businesses such as chip foundries.

The UAE Strategic Investment Fund, Abu Dhabi Pension Fund and Emirates International Investment Co. will subscribe to shares worth $250 million as cornerstone investors, Talabat said in a statement Tuesday. The deal comes amid a flurry of listings in the Middle East, where firms have raised about $10 billion from new share sales in 2024. Still, some recent large deals have had lackluster debuts. Hypermarket chain Lulu Retail raised $1.7 billion in an Abu Dhabi offering last month soon after a $2 billion IPO from a unit of Oman’s state energy company. Both firms had muted debuts, with the Omani firm closing 8% below its offer price. Still, Talabat’s margins and higher growth prospects support a valuation premium, according to Bloomberg Intelligence’s Tatiana Lisitsina, who called it the “crown jewel” of the Delivery Hero portfolio in a report last month. The firm plans to pay at least $100 million in dividends in April relative to fourth quarter financial results, plus $400 million in two installments in October 2025 and April 2026.

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting NY Congestion Pricing Survived a Pause. Here’s What Could Kill It The department will ask the judge, who ruled in August that Google illegally monopolized the search market, to require measures related to artificial intelligence and its Android smartphone operating system, according to people familiar with the plans. Antitrust officials, along with states that have joined the case, also plan to recommend Wednesday that federal judge Amit Mehta impose data licensing requirements, said the people, who asked not to be named discussing a confidential matter. If Mehta accepts the proposals, they have the potential to reshape the online search market and the burgeoning AI industry. The case was filed under the first Trump administration and continued under President Joe Biden. It marks the most aggressive effort to rein in a technology company since Washington unsuccessfully sought to break up Microsoft Corp. two decades ago. Owning the world’s most popular web browser is key for Google’s ads business. The company is able to see activity from signed-in users, and use that data to more effectively target promotions, which generate the bulk of its revenue. Google has also been using Chrome to direct users to its flagship AI product, Gemini, which has the potential to evolve from an answer-bot to an assistant that follows users around the web. Should a sale proceed, Chrome would be worth “at least $15-$20 billion, given it has over 3 billion monthly active users,” said Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Mandeep Singh. The price prospective buyers are willing to pay may depend on their ability to link Chrome to other services, said Bob O’Donnell of TECHnalysis Research. “It’s not directly monetizable,” he said. “It serves as a gateway to other things. It’s not clear how you measure that from a pure revenue-generating perspective.” Lee-Anne Mulholland, Google’s vice president of regulatory affairs, said the Justice Department “continues to push a radical agenda that goes far beyond the legal issues in this case.” She added, “the government putting its thumb on the scale in these ways would harm consumers, developers and American technological leadership at precisely the moment it is most needed.” The Justice Department declined to comment. Chrome Access Antitrust enforcers want the judge to order Google to sell off Chrome because, as the most widely used browser worldwide, it represents a key access point through which many people use its search engine, the people said. The government has the option to decide whether a Chrome sale is necessary at a later date if some of the other aspects of the remedy do not create a more competitive market, the people added. The Chrome browser controls about 61% of the market in the US, according to StatCounter, a web traffic analytics service. Government attorneys met with dozens of companies over the past three months as they prepared the recommendation. States are still considering adding some proposals and some details could change, the people said. The antitrust officials pulled back from a more severe option that would have forced Google to sell off Android, the people said. Alphabet’s Google Bracing for Antitrust Rigmarole: Legal Outlook The benefit of Chrome, which Google doesn’t charge for directly, is partially in the convenience it provides users, by making their experience with Google products more seamless, said Eric Schmidt, former Google CEO, on CNBC. “Breaking up these companies is not going to fundamentally address the annoyance you have with them.” Google said in a blog post that if other companies owned Chrome, they wouldn’t have the incentive to invest as heavily in it or keep it free, and would likely have to change its business model. Google Appeal Mehta’s August ruling that Google broke antitrust laws in both online search and search text ads markets followed a 10-week trial last year. The company has said it plans to appeal. The judge has set a two-week hearing in April on what changes Google must make to remedy the illegal behavior and plans to issue a final ruling by August 2025. The agency and the states have settled on recommending that Google be required to license the results and data from its popular search engine and give websites more options to prevent their content from being used by Google’s artificial intelligence products, said the people. The antitrust enforcers are set to propose that Google uncouple its Android smartphone operating system from its other products, including search and its Google Play mobile app store, which are now sold as a bundle, the people said. They are also prepared to seek a requirement that Google share more information with advertisers and give them more control over where their ads appear. Lawyers from the Justice Department and state attorneys general included all of those options in an initial filing in October, as well as a ban on the type of exclusive contracts that were at the center of the case against Google. A forced spinoff, if it happens, would also hinge on finding an interested buyer. Those who could afford and might want the property, like Amazon.com Inc., are also facing antitrust scrutiny that may prevent such a mega-deal. “My view is this is extremely unlikely,” Singh said in an email. But, he added, he could see a buyer like OpenAI, the maker of artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT. “That would give it both distribution and an ads business to complement its consumer chatbot subscriptions.” A merger with a US-based AI player may more easily pass government scrutiny than another tech giant, said Evelyn Mitchell-Wolf, digital advertising and media analyst at Emarketer. It “could conceivably be approved by the government as a way to prioritize AI innovation and US posturing around AI on the global stage.” AI Overviews Google now displays artificial intelligence-based answers at the top of its search pages billed as “AI Overviews.” While websites can opt-out of having their information used by Google to create AI models, they can’t afford to opt out of the overviews because that would risk pushing them down in search results, making it harder to reach their customers. Website publishers have complained that the feature dampens traffic and advertising dollars since users rarely click through to see the data being used to power those results. Earlier: Google’s AI Search Gives Sites Dire Choice: Share Data or Die Regarding data licensing, the antitrust enforcers plan to propose two options: That Google sell the underlying “click and query” data and also separately syndicate its search results, according to the people. The company currently sells syndicated search results, but with restrictions, such as preventing their use on mobile. Forcing Google to syndicate its search results would allow rival search engines and AI startups to quickly improve their quality, while the data feed would allow others to build their own search index. --With assistance from Nick Turner, Davey Alba and Julia Love.

82,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/spacex-launches-starship-rocket-trump-222621871.html,"Tue, Nov 19, 2024, 3:47 PM"," (Bloomberg) -- SpaceX achieved new feats during the sixth major test launch of its Starship system but nixed an eagerly anticipated midair “catch” of the rocket’s booster as President-elect Donald Trump looked on in South Texas. Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting NY Congestion Pricing Survived a Pause. Here’s What Could Kill It SpaceX’s launch system, comprised of the booster and Starship upper spacecraft, cleared the tower shortly after 4 p.m. local time on Tuesday. But minutes into the flight, SpaceX scrapped plans to attempt to catch the booster with giant mechanical arms — referred to as “chopsticks” — which the company completed during its previous flight. The booster, dubbed Super Heavy, was still able to perform a controlled landing in the ocean. “It was pretty epic on attempt one, but the safety of the teams and the public and the pad itself are paramount,” SpaceX engineer Kate Tice said on a live broadcast. “So we are accepting compromises.” After Super Heavy landed in the Gulf of Mexico, Starship continued its voyage through space. At one point, it successfully reignited one of its Raptor engines — the first time SpaceX was able to do so during these flight tests. Starship will need to reignite its engines in order to control its descent to Earth and maneuver through space. Starship then circled most of the globe before plunging through the atmosphere about 45 minutes into the mission, its body engulfed in the reddish orange glow of plasma as its upgraded heat shield endured intense temperatures while hurtling back to Earth. Starship appeared to survive the reentry, moving its exterior flaps to help guide its descent, though some showed signs of burn and slight damage. Then, as Starship fell through clouds, it flipped itself and reignited its engines to turn upright and softly splash into the Indian Ocean shortly after 6 p.m. New York time. It then appeared to catch on fire. “Turns out the vehicle had more capability than our calculations predicted, and that is why we test like we fly,” Tice said. The largest and most powerful rocket ever developed, Starship is under contract to function as a lunar lander that NASA will use to put people back on the moon for the first time in half a century. It’s the centerpiece of Musk’s ambition to start a settlement on Mars. The vehicle is also meant to revolutionize SpaceX’s business plan. Designed to be fully reusable, Starship will be much cheaper to fly than any other rocket, according to SpaceX, and will eventually replace the company’s industry-leading Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets. But to meet that promise of delivering a fully reusable rocket, SpaceX must refine its technique for recovering all of the pieces of Starship after launch. Around the time SpaceX aborted the booster catch, Trump and Musk left to visit the Starfactory courtyard for a visual tour of the factory bays and rockets. Trump had arrived at a launch viewing location with Musk about an hour before liftoff. Trump, wearing a blue suit and red MAGA hat, stood flanked by allies, including Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz and Donald Trump Jr., as the group peppered Musk with questions on how the launch works. It was Trump’s first visit to a Starship launch.

84,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/physical-ai-startup-brightai-bootstraps-160000063.html,"Tue, Nov 19, 2024, 8:00 AM"," When Alex Hawkinson was the CEO of SmartThings, the consumer-focused connected devices company he co-founded and sold to Samsung for around $200 million, he kept thinking that internet of things (IoT) technology could probably solve bigger issues. He left SmartThings in 2018 to figure out where connected devices could make the largest impact. He co-founded IoT company BrightAI, alongside Nathan Hanks, Douglas Burman, and Robert Parker, in 2019. When the pandemic hit in 2020, Hawkinson, now CEO, said that where BrightAI should focus became clear: infrastructure. ""In the pandemic, that downtime, sort of really made you think about what are the really important services that the modern life depends on? As you look at those, it's sort of shocking how antiquated they are in many cases,"" Hawkinson told TechCrunch. Using connected devices to fix critical infrastructure's woes became the basis for BrightAI. Hawkinson described BrightAI today as a ""physical AI"" company. BrightAI offers an end-to-end tech platform that uses sensors to help companies monitor physical assets. BrightAI's sensors are constantly sending data to an AI algorithm that processes the data and can help catch and predict potential issues before they arise. For example, pest control supplier Pelsis uses BrightAI's sensors to remotely monitor its light traps that are installed in food and pharmaceutical production facilities. BrightAI can identify and alert Pelsis if any of their light traps catch a new type of pest in between manual inspections, allowing Pelsis to deploy the necessary treatment earlier. ""It's leaving your inspector there all the time, even when there's not humans around,"" Hawkinson said. ""It lets you have this kind of real-time sense of sites and assets. You're collecting data that humans never did before, because you're there all the time, and then [you] use AI to sort of see the patterns in that and really move from reactive to proactive."" BrightAI launched its platform in stealth in 2023. It currently has seven large enterprise customers across six verticals including HVAC, waste management, and power, among others. It's deployed more than 250,000 sensors and has reached $80 million in revenue while remaining in stealth mode without raising any outside capital — until now. The company is emerging from stealth today and just raised a $15 million seed round funded entirely by Upfront Ventures. Hawkinson said that they decided to take on venture funding now because they needed capital to get to their next level of growth. He added that BrightAI has a lot more customer interest than they can currently serve. BrightAI's seed round capital will be used to expand the company's tech capabilities. Hawkinson said they want BrightAI's tech to be able to tap the data its sensors have collected to help field workers be more informed on how to fix problems. There are numerous startups taking a similar approach to AI and sensor technology that are more verticalized than BrightAI. Sensorita is a Norwegian startup that uses sensors and AI to help monitor and manage construction waste. WaveLogix is another that uses sensors to test the strength and health of concrete. Hawkinson acknowledged that building in one vertical would probably allow them to move faster, but added that they didn't want to limit their total addressable market. ""I felt like by limiting ourselves to one vertical, it would also leave so much untapped potential,"" Hawkinson said. ""So for me, it's just building a great business instead of moving fast and all the rest of it. It's like the way we can sort of maximize the impact we can have in the world."" BrightAI's tech can help companies be more precise too, Hawkinson added. Pest control companies don't need to spray solution everywhere, they can use BrightAI's sensor data to be more targeted. Water companies don't need to send as many trucks of employees out to monitor pipes, if they already know which ones need maintenance. ""It's like this beautiful thing, because as you unlock productivity, and then you unlock capital efficiency, both make these services we rely on so much better,"" Hawkinson said. ""We can reach so much more of it. But also it's pretty cool that it does it in a way that wastes a lot less."""," When Hawkinson was the CEO of SmartThings, the consumer-focused connected devices company he co-founded and sold to Samsung for around $200 million, he kept thinking that internet of things (IoT) technology could probably solve bigger issues.

BrightAI offers an end-to-end tech platform that uses sensors help companies monitor physical assets. BrightAI's sensors are constantly sending data an AI algorithm that processes the data and can help and predict potential issues before they arise. For example, pest control supplier Pelsis uses sensors to monitor its light traps that are installed in food and pharmaceutical production facilities. BrightAI can identify and alert Pelsis if any of their light traps catch a new type of pest in between manual allowing Pelsis to deploy the necessary treatment earlier.

86,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exxon-mobil-signs-non-binding-110343615.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 3:03 AM"," By Ernest Scheyder HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil said on Wednesday it has signed a non-binding lithium supply deal with battery parts maker LG Chem, the oil giant's second agreement to supply the electric vehicle battery metal from its proposed Arkansas project. Exxon last year announced plans to extract lithium from the Smackover Formation, an underground deposit of salty water known as brine that stretches from Florida through Arkansas and into Texas, using at least one type of direct lithium extraction (DLE) technology. Exxon and other oil companies such as Occidental Petroleum and Equinor are increasingly investing in lithium projects, partly due to their belief that extracting the metal from brine involves similar processes as petroleum extraction. The LG Chem agreement, which would require Arkansas officials to set a state lithium royalty rate to be finalized, is for up to 100,000 metric tons of the ultralight metal over several years. The move allows Exxon - which plans to self-fund its Arkansas project - to incorporate LG Chem's lithium quality specifications into its design plans. South Korea-based LG Chem plans to use the lithium at its Tennessee cathode facility, slated to open next year. ""This is about building a relationship with a company that has the same ambitions as building out the North American (battery) supply chain as us,"" Patrick Howarth, head of Exxon's lithium business, told Reuters. Exxon expects lithium demand to rise despite U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's campaign vow to end the ""EV mandate,"" Howarth said. ""We know that the world's going to need a lot more lithium than it's producing today,"" he said. Financial terms of the deal - including the price per metric ton of lithium that LG Chem would pay Exxon - would be negotiated as part of any final contract. SK On, a unit of SK Innovation, signed a non-binding lithium supply deal with Exxon in June. Despite recent lithium market turbulence, Howarth said Exxon has ""seen really strong support from our potential customer base."" ROYALTY Arkansas officials earlier this month rejected a proposed lithium royalty rate of 1.82% from Exxon and others. Officials have been debating a lithium royalty since at least 2018, with tension centering on how the metal should be valued given the cost for equipment to filter it from brine, which unlike oil typically has no intrinsic market value. Landowners want a higher rate, noting that most U.S. oil royalties pay between 8% and 12%. ""It's one of the key regulatory issues that we need to resolve to bring these projects to market,"" Howarth said, adding that Exxon could leave Arkansas - where it has invested more than $100 million - if the rate was too high. Officials hinted a 2.5% rate could be acceptable, which Howarth said would be ""in the range that we would be able to move forward."" Exxon would need to formally propose a new rate, which is likely in the near future, he added. Exxon declined to say how much lithium it expects to produce annually in Arkansas, although the amount would depend on which DLE technology it chooses.

87,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-sinochem-may-keep-bankrupt-105745950.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 2:57 AM"," By Chen Aizhu SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Sinochem Group may keep three bankrupt oil refineries located in eastern China after auctions to sell them drew little interest from other companies, sources familiar with the matter said. The lack of interest in the plants illustrates the woeful state of the refining sector in China, the world's biggest oil importer and second-largest consumer. Beset by flagging fuel demand amid slower economic growth that has eroded margins, the country's plants are processing less crude than the year before. The Sinochem plants, which are smaller, older and less sophisticated refineries known as teapots, are also contending with greater regulatory scrutiny that threatens the survival of other companies in Shandong province, where the majority of the teapot plants are located. Failure to sell the refineries during their individual auctions may mean state-owned Sinochem will retain them by writing down debts to creditors and renegotiating taxes owed, according to two sources familiar with Sinochem's thinking. Sinochem declined to comment. The exact amount of the debt could not immediately be ascertained, but tax administration records for the cities in Shandong where the refineries are located show that by mid-2024 the plants had accumulated combined unpaid consumption taxes of about 13.2 billion yuan ($1.82 billion). The plants, Changyi Petrochemical, Huaxing Petrochemical Group and Zhenghe Group Co, have combined crude processing capacity of 380,000 barrels per day, or 3% of national output, and were put up for auction in October through the government-backed Shandong Property Right Exchange Centre. Huaxing was offered at 8.7 billion yuan, Changyi at 6.4 billion yuan and Zhenghe for 6.3 billion yuan, data on the Centre's website showed. Sinochem, which separately runs a refinery and petrochemical complex in the southeastern province of Fujian, inherited the troubled Shandong refineries in a Beijing-orchestrated merger in 2021 with their previous operator, state-owned ChemChina. The auctions followed local court orders in September declaring all three companies bankrupt after reorganization procedures were called off. Documents on the Centre's website show that the plants do not have crude oil import quotas and that a new owner would need to re-apply for all operating licenses. That would be a deterrent to would-be buyers, said several sources at other independent refiners operating in Shandong. Without crude import quotas, the plants must rely on processing imported fuel oil, a costlier feedstock because of tariffs and the consumption tax, the sources said. Unlike rival independent refiners in Shandong, Sinochem's plants have shunned discounted crude from Russia, Iran and Venezuela because of Western sanctions, putting them at a competitive disadvantage. Dismantling the plants is an unlikely option that could mean the loss of thousands of jobs, something social stability-obsessed local authorities would be wary of, said the two sources familiar with Sinochem's thinking. Sinochem halted operations at Zhenghe and Changyi in mid-2024 as high crude oil costs and weak fuel demand reduced margins. The third plant, Huaxing Petrochemical, was closed in recent weeks, according to local consultancy Sublime China Information. In late 2021, the Shandong government ordered the three plants to ""self-rectify"" any irregular fuel tax practices, part of a national clampdown on independent refiners related to quota usage and tax payments.

The world’s largest publicly traded company by market cap, Nvidia’s stock price has continued to rocket higher throughout 2024, thanks to the explosive growth in AI across the tech landscape and beyond. Shares of Nvidia were up 192% year to date as of Wednesday, easily outpacing any of the company’s chipmaker rivals. AMD (AMD), the closest competitor, has seen its stock price sink over 5% year to date, while Intel (INTC), which is contending with a difficult turnaround, has seen its stock plunge nearly 52%. Nvidia is expected to report Q3 earnings per share (EPS) of $0.74 on revenue of $33.2 billion, according to analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. That works out to an 83% year-over-year increase on both the top and bottom lines compared to the same period last year when Nvidia saw EPS of $0.40 on revenue of $22.1 billion. Nvidia’s Data Center segment, its largest business, is set to bring in $29 billion for the quarter. That’s a 100% rise on the $14.5 billion reported in Q3 last year. Gaming revenue is expected to top out at $3 billion, up 7% from last year, when the segment brought in $2.8 billion. Analysts are anticipating gross margins to hit 75%. Investors will be on the lookout for not only whether Nvidia beats on the top and bottom lines for Q3 but also whether it raises its outlook for Q4. Analysts are expecting Nvidia to give guidance of $37 billion in revenue in the quarter. Even if the AI chip leader delivers a stellar report and outlook, its share price could still fall. Nvidia topped expectations on the top and bottom lines and beat out anticipated guidance in Q2, but its stock dropped 6% immediately after its results. That could be a sign that some investors weren’t impressed with Nvidia’s performance compared to prior quarters, where it saw revenue growth of 200% and EPS growth of nearly 600%. Or it could simply come down to investors taking profits on their gains. Investors will also be looking for any insights from CEO Jensen Huang about Nvidia’s next-generation Blackwell line of AI chips, which are used to both train and run AI applications. During the company’s last earnings call in August, Huang said Blackwell production would pick up in Q4, when he expects to see several billions of dollars of revenue from the chips. At the time, Huang said demand for Blackwell was already outstripping supply, and he anticipated that would continue in the year ahead. What’s more, he said the company’s Hopper chip, the predecessor to the Blackwell line, was expected to continue selling well into Q4. Blackwell shipments have faced delays, however, and on Sunday, the Information reported that the AI chips have run into problems with overheating servers — a potential hold-up to installation in data centers. Nvidia is facing an uncertain future, given Donald Trump has threatened to put blanket tariffs on products from around the world. In addition, the president-elect has raised the specter of tariffs on Taiwan-made chips. That would be a potential alternative to the CHIPS Act, which is designed to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US. The vast majority of Nvidia’s chips are built by TSMC in Taiwan. A tariff could mean that Nvidia will charge more for its AI chips, depressing margins, or pass the added cost on to its customers.

90,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-chip-advances-stall-us-085430834.html,"Tue, Nov 19, 2024, 12:54 AM"," (Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co.’s ambitions to create more powerful chips for AI and smartphones have hit major snags because of US sanctions, stalling a major Chinese effort to match American technology. Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting NY Congestion Pricing Survived a Pause. Here’s What Could Kill It Huawei is designing its next two Ascend processors, its answer to Nvidia Corp.’s dominant accelerators, around the same 7-nanometer architecture that’s been mainstream for years, people familiar with the matter said. That’s because US-led restrictions prevent Huawei’s chipmaking partners from procuring state-of-the-art extreme ultraviolet lithography systems from ASML Holding NV. That means its marquee chips will be stuck at aging technology till at least 2026, the people said, asking to remain unidentified discussing a sensitive project. Huawei’s smartphone processors, for the Mate lineup, face similar constraints, one of the people said. Huawei’s stall has implications not just for its business, but also for China’s broader AI ambitions. Its struggles suggest the country will lag further behind the US in 2025, when Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. — chipmaker to Apple Inc. and Nvidia — begins to crank out 2nm chips about three generations ahead. Worse, Huawei’s main production partner, Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp., is struggling to churn out even 7nm chips at steady volumes. The Shanghai-based firm’s 7nm production lines have been plagued by poor yield and reliability issues, according to another person. There’s little guarantee that Huawei will be able to secure enough smartphone processors and AI chips in coming years, the person added. Representatives for Huawei and SMIC didn’t respond to messages and calls seeking comment. Huawei’s struggles reflect how years of US sanctions have scored initial success at freezing Chinese technology advancements at current levels, and deprived its national champions of the chance to graduate to the next level. Huawei in recent years has assumed a pivotal role in China’s efforts to pursue self-sufficiency in critical areas including semiconductors and AI. But the Shenzhen-based firm’s stumble — despite heavy R&D investment and the nation’s backing — highlights the sheer difficulty Beijing faces in trying to build a world-class supply chain and catch up with the US in emerging technologies. One of the biggest bottlenecks is the inferior quality of Chinese equipment. Beijing wants local chipmakers to deploy more machines from domestic suppliers, to galvanize a domestic ecosystem. But the moratorium on EUVs — a must-have for modern chipmaking — is snarling that campaign. In response, Huawei and its partners are resorting to rather novel methods to try and scale the tech ladder. State-backed chipmakers have been trying to push the limit of ASML’s older deep ultraviolet lithography machines, the Dutch supplier’s second-best lineup (after EUVs), with the so-called quadruple patterning technique. That requires lithographic machines to perform up to four exposures on a silicon wafer, with a total margin of error of no wider than hundredths the diameter of a human hair. Compared to EUV lithography, the multi-patterning technique with DUVs is not only resource-intensive but also prone to alignment errors and yield losses, according to Ying-Wu Liu, an analyst at research firm Yole Group. That effort isn’t going well because of subpar local gear used in conjunction with ASML’s DUV systems, according to one of the people. On at least one trial production line, engineers have been forced to replace Chinese gear with foreign equipment to ensure reasonable output, the person said. “Multi-patterning inherently introduces more process steps, increasing the risk of defects and variability,” Liu said. “Additionally, the higher complexity and cost of multi-patterning make it less economically viable for high-volume production of advanced nodes like 5nm.” The Biden administration has restricted China from buying the most sophisticated equipment from American suppliers including Applied Materials Inc. and Lam Research Corp. and Nvidia’s most powerful AI chips, a red-hot commodity coveted by major tech firms and governments. WATCH: Trump Is Facing a Losing Tariff War With China Huawei needs tens of millions of Kirin-branded processors for its own smartphones every year, and aims to make hundreds of thousands of Ascend AI chips, according to a person familiar with the Shenzhen firm’s business. This year, Beijing urged Chinese companies to avoid using Nvidia and instead adopt domestic alternatives such as Huawei’s, Bloomberg News has reported. In 2023, it famously unveiled the Mate 60 Pro smartphone with a self-designed 7nm chip made by SMIC — right when Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, Biden’s chief sanctions enforcer, was touring Beijing. That cemented its tech credentials in the eyes of the Chinese public. Sales grew seven consecutive quarters on strong demand for that device. One sign of Huawei’s woes is its silence in 2024 on the processor powering its upcoming flagship smartphones, which are emerging later than the Mate 60 Pro did. Huawei is set to unveil its next-generation Mate 70 on Nov. 26. But it didn’t advertise any hardware specifications when it began taking orders this week. In past months, Huawei has instead touted progress with its Harmony mobile operating system. “Whether through improved multi-patterning or the creation of domestic EUV tools, China still faces significant challenges in achieving 5nm production with profitable yields and sufficient volume,” Yole’s Liu said. --With assistance from Jessica Sui.

92,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morning-bid-treasuries-pop-us-111935395.html,"Tue, Nov 19, 2024, 3:19 AM"," A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan U.S. Treasuries got a rare lift on Tuesday, with speculation about Donald Trump's pick for Treasury Secretary centering on a relatively familiar face of Kevin Warsh just as a geopolitical ""safety bid"" was stoked by nuclear sabre-rattling from Russia. Those safety trades emerged early in Europe on Tuesday after Moscow responded with nuclear threats to Washington's decision this week allowing Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied weapons to hit Russian territory. Sovereign debt, gold and Japan's yen all popped higher while European stocks and the euro fell back after reports Russian leader Vladimir Putin had updated Moscow's military policy and ""nuclear doctrine"". The revision said Moscow could respond with nuclear weapons if it was subject to a conventional missile attack that was supported by a nuclear power. Given the gravity of that threat, the moves have been relatively modest so far - largely because Putin has repeatedly threatened the use of nuclear weapons ever since Russia invaded neighbouring Ukraine a thousand days ago today. Yet, for markets, the sudden retreat in Treasury yields - pumped up recently by Trump's tax and tariff plans, sticky inflation readings and pared-back Federal Reserve easing bets - was perhaps the biggest whiplash. Two-year yields retreated to their lowest in 11 days while 10-year yields slipped back below 4.35%. And while that would typically knock the dollar back too, the safety bid - certainly against the euro - was enough to lift the dollar index more broadly. But before Putin's latest move, Treasuries had already been slipping back from recent highs - in part because Warsh, a former Fed governor, has suddenly emerged as clear favorite in betting markets to get nominated for the top job at the Treasury. The Polymarket online betting site put Warsh at 44% on Tuesday - almost 20 points clear of the second favorite, hedge fund manager Scott Bessent, and the third most-backed, Apollo Global Management chief executive Marc Rowan. Warsh, a Visiting Fellow at the Hoover Institution of Stanford University, has a track record of hawkish views on both inflation and deficits and was White House economic policy adviser from 2002 to 2006 before being appointed to the Fed. He left the central bank in 2011, a few months after joining his colleagues in unanimous support of expanding the Fed's bond-buying program - and then making public his reservations about expanding the Fed balance sheet. Given some of the other controversial appointments to the new Trump cabinet, however, many on Wall Street would see Warsh as a known quantity at least, someone across the big macro issues and likely sensitive to the Fed's independent role in steering monetary policy. Elsewhere on Tuesday, the generalised ""risk off"" tone seemed to dominate. Already subdued by the prospect of a looming global trade war, euro stocks fell more than 1% and the index is flirting again with its lowest levels in three months. Bank of Italy boss Fabio Panetta said the European Central Bank needs to ""focus on the sluggishness of the real economy"" and move official interest rates into ""neutral, or even expansionary, territory"". Earlier in Asia, similar trade worries weighed on China's markets initially and mainland benchmarks hit two-week lows before rebounding to positive territory before the close. China's central bank is widely expected to leave its benchmark lending rates unchanged on Wednesday as rate cuts a month earlier squeeze banks' profitability and the yuan comes under fresh pressure due to Trump's tariff threats. Back on Wall Street, stock futures were down ahead of Tuesday's bell in sympathy with the downbeat global risk mood. Chip giant Nvidia's results on Wednesday dominate the week's events, but Walmart will give a retail spin with its update later on Tuesday. Meantime, new year outlooks from the major investment banks are also starting to stream in. Goldman Sachs forecast the S&P 500 would rise another 10% to reach 6,500 by the end of 2025, in line with the view from its peer Morgan Stanley, on the back of continued growth in the U.S. economy and corporate earnings. Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Tuesday: * US October housing starts/permits; Canada Oct CPI inflation * G20 leaders summit in Rio de Janeiro * Kansas City Federal Reserve President Jeffrey Schmid speaks * US corporate earnings: Walmart, Medtronic, Keysight Technologies, Jacobs Solutions, Lowe's etc (By Mike Dolan, editing by Mark Heinrich)"," A at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Dolan U.S. Treasuries got a rare lift on Tuesday, with speculation Donald Trump's for Treasury Secretary centering on a relatively familiar face of Kevin Warsh just as a geopolitical ""safety was stoked by nuclear sabre-rattling from Russia.

Here’s What Could Kill It The server maker said late Monday that it submitted a plan to the Nasdaq exchange for filing its 10-K financial disclosure report delayed in August. The company also announced that it appointed BDO USA as its independent auditor, effective immediately. “In its compliance plan to Nasdaq, the company indicated that it believes that it will be able to complete its annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2024, and its quarterly report on 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended Sept. 30, 2024, and become current with its periodic reports within the discretionary period available to the Nasdaq staff to grant,” Super Micro said Monday in a statement. If Super Micro’s proposal is accepted by the exchange, its new deadline for the document will likely be pushed to February. It will be able to stay listed on the Nasdaq until a final decision about its compliance is made. If a plan isn’t approved, the company can appeal the decision. Super Micro’s previous auditor, Ernst & Young LLP, resigned in October, citing concerns over the company’s transparency and governance. Ernst & Young is one of the Big Four accounting firms, the auditors that vet the books of the world’s largest companies. BDO USA is the sixth-largest auditor by revenue, according to Inside Public Accounting. The firm has only one other S&P 500 company as a client, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Finding an auditor is a “big step for them,” even if it isn’t one of the Big Four firms, Matt Bryson, an analyst at Wedbush, said in an interview. “This is a positive step in terms of putting a plan forth in front of Nasdaq, and, at least from their perspective, hopefully being able to file their financials and put these problems to bed.” Having a new auditor and a plan to regain compliance with Nasdaq’s listing rules is the latest update in a tumultuous few months for Super Micro, which had gained favor with investors earlier this year as a potential beneficiary of the demand for artificial intelligence services. The San Jose, California-based company delayed filing its annual 10-K following a damaging report from short seller Hindenburg Research, and last week said it would be late with quarterly reports. Super Micro is also facing a US Department of Justice probe. The shares had tumbled more than 80% from a peak in March through Monday’s close. The company has gone through a delisting and relisting process before. In 2019, the shares were taken off the Nasdaq exchange after Super Micro failed to meet deadlines to file a 10-K and several quarterly reports. The company received approval to rejoin the exchange in 2020, and in the same year paid a $17.5 million penalty to resolve an investigation by the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Super Micro didn’t admit to or deny the regulator’s allegations as part of its settlement. Some stock bulls are reiterating their case for the stock. “We take the view that regardless of its regulatory woes (now receding in the rear-view mirror), SMCI maintains its leadership in the massive, scalable AI data center market for liquid-cooled server racks,” said Lynx Equity’s KC Rajkumar. “SMCI has a leadership position in the rapidly expanding liquid-cooled GPU server data center market, a position it is unlikely to give up any time soon,” Rajkumar said. --With assistance from Nicola M.

94,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/morning-bid-nvidia-vigil-sees-112547969.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 3:25 AM"," A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan Tuesday's geopolitical angst faded fast in world markets as positioning ahead of today's results from AI-giant Nvidia saw Big Tech lead a Wall Street rebound - one that futures look to have sustained overnight. After months of basically ignoring the Ukraine conflict, world markets suddenly got the jitters yesterday after Ukraine made use of its new freedom to use U.S.-supplied missiles on Russian territory and Moscow responded with nuclear threats. But with so much of the conflict now in flux as Donald Trump's new administration prepares to take the helm in Washington in January, investors were wary of over-interpreting daily events there for now or chasing 'safety trades' too far. Reinforcing the point on Wednesday, the Kremlin seems keen to position itself for some sort of Trump-brokered settlement - even though it rules out making any territorial concessions and insists Kyiv abandon ambitions to join NATO. The upshot in markets over the past 24 hours has been to return the focus to the two other obsessions of the week - the Nvidia earnings update after the bell today and speculation about who gets the nod to take over the Treasury next year. The rebound in U.S. stocks on Tuesday was aided by a 3% advance in WalMart to a record closing high after the retailer raised its annual sales and profit forecasts for the third consecutive time - with some aggravating inflation signals also embedded in some of its pricing readouts. But earnings from the $3.6 trillion-valued Nvidia will likely steal the show later and its stock surged almost 5% on Tuesday ahead of the release. Options traders are primed for a nearly $300-billion swing in its market value following the chipmaker's results on Wednesday. Nvidia options implied an 8.5% swing in either direction - in line with previous percentage results-day moves but now amplified by sheer scale of market cap in what's now the world's most highly-valued company. Encouraging the renewed tech fizz, Super Micro Computer jumped more than 30% on Tuesday after the artificial intelligence server maker named BDO USA as its auditor and said it has submitted a plan to the Nasdaq to avoid delisting. All of which saw megacap tech outperform yesterday, even though the wider market was less enthused and the equal-weighted S&P500 actually ended in the red. Combining the tech excitement and a post-election crypto surge on Trump-related de-regulation hopes, Bitcoin resumed its climb and topped $94,000 for the first time overnight. The latest spur was a report that Trump's social media company was in talks to buy crypto trading firm Bakkt. In fixed income, Treasuries also gave back their brief safety bid overnight too - with a 20-year bond auction due later in the day. Even though housing starts numbers showed some softness on Tuesday, benchmark 10-year yields reclaimed all of the day's losses and climbed back above 4.4%. Speculation about who gets the nod as Treasury Secretary remains intense, with one of those tipped - Cantor Fitzgerald boss Howard Lutnick - now out of the running as he was nominated for the Commerce Department role instead. Former Federal Reserve governor Kevin Warsh remains the favorite in betting markets, but some reports said Apollo chief executive Marc Rowan is still being considered. Elsewhere, the rebound in stocks and Treasury yields pushed the dollar higher across the board - but stock markets in Asia and Europe also advanced on Wednesday, even China's tariff-wary equity indexes. Sterling and gilt yields pushed higher after a slightly hotter-than-forecast British inflation reading for last month, with the headline consumer price inflation rate jumping as high as 2.3% and above the Bank of England's target again. Although skewed by shifts in regulated energy prices, the news is likely to reinforce the BoE's cautious stance on further interest rate cuts and money markets now don't see another quarter-point rate cut until March. Curiously, Fed futures also don't fully price another U.S. rate cut until March - although there's slightly more than a 50% chance it pulls the trigger again next month. The Japanese yen, meantime, also gave up its 'safety bid' from Tuesday - even after robust October export data. Japan's exports expanded faster than expected last month, led by a pick-up in chip equipment demand in China that may nod to some hurried trade activity before Trump takes office and potentially kicks off a fresh tariff war. Key developments that should provide more direction to U.S. markets later on Wednesday: * US corporate earnings: Nvidia, Palo Alto Networks, Target, TJX * Federal Reserve Board Governors Michelle Bowman and Lisa Cook and Boston Fed President Susan Collins all speak, Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr testifies in the House; European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, ECB Vice President Luis de Guindos and Irish central bank chief Gabriel Makhlouf all speak; Bank of England policymaker Dave Ramsden speaks * US Treasury sells $16 billion of 20-year bonds (By Mike Dolan,; mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com; Editing by Toby Chopra) This is what could happen next to Nvidia shares.

95,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/star-em-stock-picker-gets-091500379.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 5:20 AM"," (Bloomberg) -- Rob Marshall-Lee is among the few money managers generating US stock market-like returns with investments in emerging-market companies. He does it by avoiding most of them. Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting NY Congestion Pricing Survived a Pause. Here’s What Could Kill It The founding partner and chief investment officer of Cusana Capital LLP, Marshall-Lee has provided investors in his EM equity fund with a 37% gain over the past 12 months, beating the S&P 500 and 97% of peers, according to the latest available data as of Sept. 30. He holds only one of the top 20 companies on the benchmark MSCI emerging-market index, and credits that for his outperformance. The reason is that the bulk of emerging-market companies destroy the returns generated by a select group of booming stocks, the money manager said. It’s better to own a portfolio of concentrated holdings, he said, modeling his picks after the so-called “Magnificent Seven” US tech companies. “In emerging markets, the top 5% of stocks by number generate 83% of net wealth creation, while 95% destroyed value in aggregate,” London-based Marshall-Lee said in an interview. “You need to avoid the 95% and focus all your efforts on finding that 5%. Within that, we try to identify just the top 25 or 30 companies with the best risk-reward.” He said companies like chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., his only top-20 MSCI index holding; Indian consumer goods company Titan Co.; and Sao Paulo-based NuBank tend to have consistent attributes such as good governance, strong potential for market share growth and high return on capital. “Every decision is made with a five-year view, which gives us a big advantage versus the rest of the market who are trying to guess what happens next quarter,” he said. While many investors diversify to reduce risk and rely on tracking benchmark indexes, Marshall-Lee said that approach actually increases risks. For example, his funds exited from Russian positions just before the invasion of Ukraine in 2022 due to a focus on “avoiding permanent loss of capital” and his estimate — from that time — of a 30% chance of losing all the money held in Moscow stocks. Select Few Zooming out to a global scale, he avoids most of the more than 4,000 listed emerging-market companies and buys shares in about 30 stocks from an investible universe of 300. “It’s amazing how much most EM equity portfolios look like each other, particularly the top 10 stocks in EM funds — everyone owns Samsung and the large benchmark stocks.” Marshall-Lee manages $330 million across two funds with the same EM strategy, which is a continuation of the $3.5 billion strategy he ran at Newton Asset Management from 2011 until 2020, when he left the firm. He founded boutique Cusana Capital in 2022 with Jos Trusted, formerly a manager at Odey Asset Management. The fund is backed by Sector Asset Management, one of Norway’s largest independent investment firms. The money manager pushes back against the consensus that Donald Trump’s election means investors should reduce their exposure to emerging-market equities. Prevailing market logic can prove quite wrong, he said, as it did at the end of 2016 when Trump was first elected. For now, a stronger dollar, higher US bond yields and a selloff in China have EM assets on the retreat, with the benchmark index falling 2.2% in November, even as the S&P 500 advanced 3.7%. That’s increased the performance gap between the asset classes to a record. The benchmark emerging-market index fell on Wednesday, paring this year’s gains to less than 7%. Unlike some competitors who’ve juiced their returns by populating their emerging-market stock funds with US-based companies that are active globally, Marshall-Lee’s guidelines require 100% of stocks in his portfolio to be majority EM-driven, meaning either listed, domiciled or deriving over 50% of their profit, assets or revenue from emerging markets. Nvidia fulfilled the 50% EM criteria in the past, hence Marshall-Lee bought shares in early 2023. He sold them in June 2024, at a 370% profit, when the firm’s segmental disclosure showed it no longer met this metric. DM-domiciled stocks contributed about 20% of this year’s returns, he said. Geographically, Marshall-Lee’s greatest exposure is in Asia, where he likes “rapidly growing domestic businesses in India and ASEAN markets.” For the last 13 years, 30% or more of his portfolio has been in India, with a strong focus on consumer-centric businesses like Titan. “We have probably made about 14 times our money in that stock. Relatively low risk but very high return,” he said. Consumption Focus Another 10% is allocated to Vietnam and about 10% to Indonesia. The vast majority of companies in China are still “pretty unattractive,” Marshall-Lee said. He’d like to see government stimulus efforts there focused much more on “rebalancing toward consumption.” The exception is electric-vehicle battery companies, which tend to be founder-led and self-financing and are outliers in the China index, he said. He also owns some local cosmetics companies that are taking market share away from international brands. The portfolio manager declined to reveal his favorite stocks, but said that over the last 12 months his funds had held shares in companies including Varun Beverages, Central Depository Services India Ltd and SEA Ltd. Outside of Asia, he said Turkey offers potential opportunity under improved economic management, and while he has relatively small exposure to Latin America, he’s looking with interest at Argentina. “There are quite binary risks when you are coming out of hyperinflation, but when you’ve got an economy with basically zero credit penetration, the potential is very substantial,” he said. “We aren’t invested there at the moment, but it is certainly a market worth monitoring.” (Updates markets in 11th paragraph.)

96,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-going-lifeway-stock-rejecting-170856360.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 9:08 AM"," Lifeway Foods, Inc. (NASDAQ:LWAY) shares are trading lower on Wednesday after the company’s Board of Directors rejected a revised unsolicited acquisition proposal from Danone North America PBC. The proposal on November 15 offered $27.00 per share to acquire all of Lifeway’s shares that Danone does not already own. After careful evaluation, including consultations with independent financial and legal advisors, the Lifeway Board determined that the offer significantly undervalued the company and was not in the best interests of Lifeway’s shareholders or other stakeholders. According to a recent Schedule 13D amendment filing, Danone beneficially owns approximately 23.3% of Lifeway’s outstanding common stock.

Here's what investors need to know today. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA), which jumped 5% yesterday, are edging higher in premarket trading as investors prepare for the release of the chipmaker's highly anticipated earnings report after markets close. Analysts expect revenue to grow 84% year-over-year to $33.29 billion and net income to jump to $17.47 billion or 70 cents per share, up from $9.24 billion or 37 cents per share last year, according to Visible Alpha. Nvidia shares gained steam ahead of the report, as analysts grew more bullish on the chipmaker's prospects. Shares of Target (TGT) are dropping 18% in premarket trading after the retailer missed estimates for sales and profit in its third-quarter earnings report. Target reported $25.67 billion in revenue and $854 million in net income, below analysts' expectations.

Bitcoin (BTCUSD) is more than 1% higher at around $93,500 after the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization briefly crossed the $94,000 mark. The rise in the cryptocurrency's price has been good for companies in that space, including MicroStrategy (MSTR), which recently added $4.6 billion in bitcoin to its portfolio and is 3% higher in premarket trading, building on recent gains. Since Donald Trump's presidential election victory, bitcoin has soared around 35% amid optimism that the incoming administration will establish policies that broadly benefit the asset class.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Waste Dive newsletter. Ripple effects from a notable acquisition in New York continue to play out, as the city’s Department of Sanitation faces pressure to move quicker on implementing a commercial waste zone system five years after it became law. The system will replace a longstanding open market in the city by dividing it into 20 non-exclusive zones, with three haulers each, plus five contracts for citywide container service. DSNY announced 65 contracts in January, but that list of awardees has already begun to shift due to acquisitions. DSNY signaled in a Wednesday council hearing that it could award two new contracts to unspecified companies, following gaps created by Waste Connections’ recent acquisition of fellow awardee Royal Waste Services. “We remain steadfast in our commitment that there must be three carters per zone and that no carter may have more than 15 zones, including via subsidiaries, in order to maintain necessary market competition and keep prices down,” said DSNY Commissioner Jessica Tisch in prepared testimony. “In the case of current consolidation already underway that may necessitate a new award, we plan to use the existing RFP documents given their recency and continued relevance. In the future, as time goes on, that may change and new bids may be necessary.” Waste Connections and Royal overlapped in one zone, and the deal also put the company over the city’s 15-zone limit. The changes leave the potential for one new awardee each in the zones of Queens West and Brooklyn Southwest. Another consequence of the deal, which hadn’t been previously reported, was that Royal exited the New York Recycling Solutions joint venture it formed with fellow awardee Cogent Waste Solutions to bid on zone contracts. NYRS was awarded two zones. A public records request to the city’s Business Integrity Commission, which licenses commercial waste haulers, confirmed that ownership changed at NYRS ahead of Royal’s sale to Waste Connections. An August update submitted to BIC listed Cogent as owning 50% of NYRS, with Nino and Anthony Tristani also owning 25% each. The Tristanis are the founders of Cogent and also are listed as vice presidents of NYRS. Cogent and its affiliates now effectively have contracts in six zones, putting it in fourth place for the most contracts. Waste Connections has the most, with 15 zones plus one citywide contract, followed by Interstate Waste Services subsidiary Action Environmental, with 14 zones and one citywide contract. A joint venture between Mr. T Carting and Boro-Wide Recycling is in third, with six zones and one citywide contract. Cogent has faced scrutiny for a range of alleged violations and prior issues, leading DSNY to appoint an independent monitor at the company and at NYRS earlier this year. That monitor remains in place. The waste zone system was created when then-Mayor Bill de Blasio signed Local Law 199 on Nov. 20, 2019. The pandemic, among other factors, played a part in delaying the system rollout. DSNY has only announced implementation timing for one zone, Queens Central, spurring pushback from groups who feel Mayor Eric Adams’ administration is not moving quickly enough. Transform Don’t Trash, a coalition of labor and environmental groups that supported the law’s passage, called for the city to speed up its process in a Wednesday release. The group also requested that DSNY publish awardees’ plans for safety and facility usage, and it raised concerns about truck traffic going to private transfer stations in environmental justice areas. “We need to get this city’s private waste collection industry under control,” said Brooklyn Borough President Antonio Reynoso, who was the bill’s primary sponsor when he served as a council member, in a statement. “The sooner the CWZ program is rolled out citywide, the sooner we can measure its efficacy and make any changes we need to better deliver on the program’s promises.” Haulers are expected to meet a range of environmental, safety and technology requirements to operate in this system. Proponents want implementation to advance faster to realize more of their goals for the program. “Although it’s been five years since New York City passed the landmark Commercial Waste Zones law, this administration is still lagging behind on implementation — even as the urgency of issues caused by private waste collection is reaching a tipping point,” said Council Member Sandy Nurse in a statement. “These companies must be held responsible for their role in holding our city back from meeting critical climate goals and the much needed reform to our sanitation system.” The Queens Central transition began in September. DSNY worked with other agencies to create a registry of approximately 12,000 customers that could be affected. According to minutes from an Oct. 8 safety task force meeting, an outreach team engaged with an estimated 8,000 businesses in person over the summer. This outreach team is continuing to engage with the remaining 4,000 businesses that couldn’t be reached. On Wednesday, Tisch said that DSNY will gain “significant new enforcement capabilities” once that zone is fully implemented. In the meantime, as implementation continues, DSNY enforcement personnel already have issued 114 summonses to commercial carters in Queens Central “for everything from safety violations to offenses against basic cleanliness.” Starting in January, all customers in Queens Central will need to have a contract with one of the approved haulers in that zone. DSNY previously said it expects to announce the timing of further zone rollouts after this initial transition is complete."," This story was originally published on Dive.

99,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/escalating-russia-tensions-could-impact-112500820.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 3:25 AM"," As the yearslong Russia-Ukraine war intensifies, experts say some key components of the modern economy could be at risk, and markets are still guessing as to what the conflict could bring next. On Sunday, President Biden gave Ukraine permission to use U.S.-made long-range missiles to strike deep into Russian territory, a move marking a stark reversal from the administration a mere two months before leaving office. Ukraine quickly seized on the newfound permission to strike a facility in the Bryansk region Tuesday using U.S.-made missiles, Russia’s Defense Ministry said. In response, Russian President Vladimir Putin lowered the country’s threshold for using nuclear weapons, a clear warning to the West. Due in part to the escalating aggression, all three major indexes fell early Tuesday, with the Dow dropping about 450 points and the S&P 500 dropping 0.5% soon after market open. Yet, by the end of the day, markets were mixed, with the Nasdaq jumping 1%, fueled in part by Nvidia earnings, and the S&P notching a 0.3% advance. Meanwhile, the Dow fell about 0.3%, or 120.66 points. Fueling the market whipsaw was the uncertainty of Russia’s response to Ukraine’s latest strike, economist Aleksandar Tomic, the associate dean for strategy, innovation, & technology at Boston College’s Woods College of Advancing Studies, told Fortune. While stocks have been on the upswing in recent weeks since President-elect Donald Trump won the White House, there has been some volatility recently, said Tomic, and geopolitical issues are adding to the uncertainty. “The Ukrainians did what they did, now, the question is, what do the Russians do to retaliate,” Tomic said. “And I think what it is, is that nobody knows, so that breeds uncertainty, and then markets react to uncertainty.” Another way that an escalated conflict in Ukraine could affect markets is through the threat to natural resources that make up semiconductors, which are already facing a shortage, said Usha Haley, an international business professor at Wichita State University. Key components of semiconductors, such as Palladium and Neon are found either in Russia or Ukraine, Haley told Fortune. “Semiconductors are central to many US industries, so these shortages and resulting production delays will likely have broad economic impact through supply chains and lead to more inflation,” Haley said. Still, Tomic said the risk of the Russia-Ukraine war having a major impact on markets is likely overblown because investors have already priced in the risks during the nearly four-year-long conflict. Other geopolitical concerns such as Trump’s proposed tariffs on imported foreign products are more likely to have an impact, Tomic said. “I don't expect that this [conflict] would be a big driver for any kind of market activity, barring, again, something like Russia launching this housing to Germany, or something silly like that. Then, of course, it would be a whole new reality.” Still, in part because of geopolitical instability and the threat of tariffs and inflation resurgence, Gold saw a 0.6% increase while Bitcoin reached an all-time high of $94,000 before retreating. With the strikes Tuesday, Ukraine may be trying to gain an advantage ahead of any possible policy changes made by Trump as regards Ukraine in January, Tomic said. Trump has previously said he could end the Russia-Ukraine war in “24 hours.” Earlier this month, a former adviser to the president-elect said Trump would prioritize ending the conflict over regaining Russia-held territories such as Crimea for Ukraine, the BBC reported. On the prediction market Polymarket, which predicted Trump’s election victory, the odds of him ending the war in Ukraine in his first 90 days sat at 38% as of Tuesday. While the conflict may not have an outsized effect on U.S. markets, Europe may be a different story. Germany’s foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said Tuesday that the country would not be intimidated by Putin’s lowering of Russia’s nuclear threshold. Yet, because of their proximity to the conflict, countries such as Germany may be more affected by an escalation, especially if nuclear weapons are involved. Partly because of this risk, indexes in Germany, France, and Spain all closed down more than 0.5% Tuesday. In the worst case scenario, Putin could expand the conflict into Poland or Germany and get NATO to engage or even launch a cyberattack on the U.S., said Tomic. “The question is, what exactly are they capable of,” he said.

Shoppers didn't spend as much on apparel and other discretionary products such as furniture, appliances and electronics during the three-month period ending Nov. 2, 2024. However, sales of beauty products were up 6%. Target also forecast flat comparable sales during the current fourth quarter, which includes the holiday shopping season – a troublesome sign for the retail industry as a whole. During the third quarter, Target reported an increase in comparable sales of 0.3%, compared to a year ago, but that fell short of the average analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg. Sales at comparable stores fell 1.9%, while digital sales increased 10.8% during the quarter, the company said. It's a forecast that pales compared with Walmart's expected increase of 4.8%-to-5.1% in sales in the current quarter including the holiday shopping season, which the retailer announced Tuesday. Walmart earnings: Retailer projects fruitful holiday shopping season, stock jumps again ""Consumers continue to spend cautiously, most notably in discretionary categories,"" Target CEO Brian Cornell said in a conference call Wednesday while detailing the company's financial performance. Gas deal: Circle K offers 40 cents off all gas types before Thanksgiving: Here's when to get the deal Target shares plummeted 20% in early trading Wednesday. The sharp drop put the company's stock price down about 14% year-to-date. While the retailer saw an increase in store traffic, Cornell called the third quarter ""a volatile operating environment,"" in a statement included with the earnings results. ""We saw several strengths across the business, including a 2.4 percent increase in traffic, nearly 11 percent growth in the digital channel, and continued growth in beauty and frequency categories,"" Cornell said. ""At the same time, we encountered some unique challenges and cost pressures that impacted our bottom-line performance."" Total revenue of $25.7 billion in the third quarter was up 1.1% over the previous year, but fell short of the $25.9 billion expected by analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence. Increased digital sales cut into profit because of the higher cost of fulfilling orders, the company said. The company also had higher supply chain costs due to managing higher inventory levels, which occurred because the retailer ordered more goods to offset a potential port strike Oct. 1. Skittish and deal-hungry customers responded well to the Target Circle Week, held Oct. 6-12. But sales dipped the week before and after the sales event, the company said, suggesting how resourceful customers have become. And executives expressed excitement about customers being drawn to the stores for the upcoming Nov. 29 release of Taylor Swift's “The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology” on vinyl and CD, exclusively at Target, which includes four acoustic bonus songs (the vinyl album also includes a poster of Swift). During the period, the retailer added nearly three million members to its Target Circle loyalty program, which it revamped in April. Target also cut prices on more than 2,000 items this holiday season. While shopper visits rose 2.4% during the three-month period, that was lower than the 3% traffic growth in the prior quarter. ""Things have taken a turn (for Target) in Q3. And it seems that the softness is going to linger into the holiday season as well,"" CFRA analyst Arun Sundaram told Reuters.

Investing in a dividend stock is no different from investing in any other stock. You’ll need a brokerage account, which can easily be set up through an online broker, in order to place a trade. Once your account is set up and funded, you can choose which dividend stocks to invest in. Your broker may even be able to help you identify dividend stocks with large payouts through its research offering. If you’re not quite sure which high-dividend stocks to choose, a dividend fund may be a better option for you.

Some of these funds focus on stocks with high dividend yields, while others look for companies that have consistently paid and grown their dividends over time.

The stock formed a shooting star on Tuesday, a reversal candlestick pattern that appears after an extended uptrend. The pattern formed on the highest daily volume since late September, possibly indicating buying exhaustion. Investors should watch major support levels on Walmart's chart around $81, $71, and $61. A bars pattern projects a price target in the stock of around $89 and indicates the shares may be abount to enter a consolidation phase. Walmart (WMT) shares were slightly higher Wednesday morning after hitting a new record high yesterday following a strong earnings report from the retail giant. During the earnings call, CEO Douglas McMillon told analysts that the retailer continues to capture market share gains from higher-income households, adding that he expects the trend to last as these consumers have embraced the company’s membership program and same-day delivery service. Walmart shares inched higher to around $87 in recent trading, after hitting an all-time high of $88.29 on Tuesday. The stock has gained 65% since the start of the year, handily outpacing the S&P 500’s 23% return over the same period. Below, we break down the technicals on Walmart’s chart and identify important post-earnings price levels that investors may be watching. After bottoming out just below the 200-day moving average in December last year, Walmart shares have tracked higher, with two breakaway gaps separating three distinct trending moves. Although the stock rallied to a new all-time high (ATH) on Tuesday, it closed near its opening price to form a shooting star, a reversal candlestick pattern, which comprises a small body with a long upper shadow that appears after an extended uptrend. It’s also worth pointing out that the shooting star pattern formed on the highest daily volume since late September, possibly indicating buying exhaustion. Below we identify three major support levels on Walmart’s chart and also apply a bars pattern to analyze the stock’s current uptrend. The first key lower level to watch sits around $81. This area may provide support near a trendline that connects a range of similar trading levels on the chart between mid-September and late October. A close below this level opens the door for a decline to the $71 region, a location on the chart where investors could seek buying opportunities near the prominent July swing high. Depending on the timing of such a move, this area could also potentially align with the rising 200-day MA. Further selling could see the shares fill the mid-May gap and revisit major support around $61. Bargain hunters may look for buy-and-hold opportunities in this area near twin peaks that formed on the chart during March. Investors can use a bars pattern to gain insight about the stock’s third trending period, which appears to closely resemble the first trending phase. To forecast a target using the tool, we take the price bars from that first move and position them from the low of the third trending period. This projects a target of around $89, just above the stock’s ATH set on Tuesday. Further analysis of the first trending move shows that it played out over 69 trading days before the shares consolidated. Interestingly, the current move higher has trended over 67 trading days, indicating the stock may be about to enter a consolidation phase if price history rhymes.

Here’s What Could Kill It International Atomic Energy Agency inspectors have verified the Islamic Republic has taken necessary steps to stop the production of the highly-enriched nuclear fuel, Director General Rafael Mariano Grossi said Wednesday at a press briefing. That could pave the way for an improvement in relations between Iran and the IAEA after a years-long standoff. “They are taking a different direction,” Grossi said. “This is the first time that they are saying, ‘okay, we stop.’” The Iranian move has been interpreted as an olive branch by President Masoud Pezeshkian to the incoming administration of US President Donald Trump, who took an ultra-aggressive stance toward the Islamic Republic in his first term through 2021 dubbed “maximum pressure.” That included the withdrawal from an international agreement that capped Iran’s nuclear activities and the imposing of severe economic sanctions, but led to a drop in transparency over the extent of the country’s atomic activities. Iran dialed down its nuclear work following talks between Grossi and Pezeshkian earlier this month in Tehran. The IAEA chief on Wednesday praised a follow-up conversation with Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi this week that should yield more concrete results. Iran has always said its atomic work is entirely for energy needs. With the IAEA’s 35-nation board deliberating Iran’s nuclear program this week in Vienna, Grossi appealed to its members to act with “prudence, collaboration and restraint” to avoid escalation “in a region that has suffered too much.” Some European nations are pushing for a so-called resolution of censure, which would require the IAEA to produce a comprehensive report and could eventually trigger a referral to the UN Security Council to consider more sanctions. Israel — which sees Iran’s nuclear-weapon capabilities as an existential threat — expects the IAEA board of governors “to speak in a clear voice and make a robust decision” to pass the resolution, Foreign Minister Gideon Sa’ar said in a statement, without referring to Iran’s latest pledge. “It is crucial that the resolution passes, because know that in these very days there are elements within Iran that are trying to push Iran to make progress with the weaponization of the nuclear project,” Sa’ar said. Iran has become increasingly embroiled in conflict with US ally Israel in the past 14 months. The two countries have twice exchanged direct fire this year, including in October, while Tehran-backed militant groups have been battling Israel in both Lebanon and Gaza. Responding to Israeli assertions that Iran has re-started nuclear work at its Parchin military base, Grossi said his inspectors “don’t have any facts to substantiate this.” Iran began enriching uranium at up to 60% levels in 2021. That material could quickly be upgraded to the 90% level typically used in nuclear weapons, prompting concern across Europe and the U.S. Grossi warned that applying too much pressure on Iran at the wrong time could unintentionally damage a bedrock arms-control agreement and prompt the country to consider leaving the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. “It’s important that we reinforce and we protect the nonproliferation regime,” he said. Iran still has enough fuel on hand to produce a handful of warheads, the IAEA said, giving it room to maneuver should its leadership make a political decision to move forward with nuclear armament. Inspectors have lost “continuity of knowledge” over key parts of the country’s nuclear work, which would need to be restored as part of a broader deal to control and oversee activities, they said. In a 12-page report published on Tuesday, IAEA monitors said Iran has held back from feeding uranium into new lines of advanced centrifuges at its Fordow enrichment facility, which Israel has threatened to attack. Speaking after meeting Grossi last week, Pezeshkian said Iran wants to resolve “ambiguities and alleged doubts about our country’s peaceful nuclear activities,” according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency. --With assistance from Dan Williams.

106,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/finance-execs-unlock-career-heights-133432263.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 5:34 AM"," The financial services sector is a vital part of the UK's economy, employing 2.5 million people and generating £278bn in economic output. According to the UK Government report State of the Sector: Annual Review of UK Financial Services 2023, the sector employs over 1.1 million in financial services and 1.3 million in related professional services. However, the finance job market is currently experiencing a significant and continued decline in active jobs. Since a peak in July 2022, challenges primarily driven by inflation, supply-side disruptions, and the impact of automation technologies have contributed to a notable reduction in finance job numbers. Adding further fuel to the fire, 2023 saw global banks cutting approximately 60,000 jobs, marking the largest decline in job postings since the 2009 financial crisis. Beyond the industry’s continued belt-tightening, it has been suggested that the use of AI will also contribute to dwindling job numbers. A new report by Citi suggests that 54% of jobs in the banking sector have a high potential for automation, with another 12% showing potential to be augmented by AI. As banks adapt to increased competition for roles, those looking to advance their careers will need to find ways to differentiate themselves in a crowded field. AI technologies, for example, are increasingly automating tasks across various banking functions, including customer management, fraud detection, risk management, and knowledge retrieval, which traditionally require human intervention. Subsequently, roles that focus on manual tasks may diminish, leading to a demand for skills in managing and overseeing AI systems rather than performing the tasks themselves. Employees will increasingly require skills that facilitate cross-functional teamwork and communication to ensure that AI initiatives align with the bank's broader strategic goals. There will also be a growing need for professionals skilled in data analytics and machine learning, as banks increasingly rely on AI for market trend forecasts and customer behaviour predictions. Professionals will need to be proficient in interpreting complex data sets and utilising AI tools to drive strategic decisions. With AI's growing role in banking, the regulatory landscape is also evolving. Staying informed about compliance issues related to AI, particularly concerning data privacy and ethical considerations, will prove crucial. This shift emphasises the need for knowledge in regulatory compliance and risk management, as banks navigate the challenges posed by new technologies. The integration of AI in banking will not only alter existing roles but also necessitate a shift in skills towards data analysis, regulatory compliance, and collaborative practices. As such, ongoing training and development will be critical for finance professionals to adapt to these changes and progress their careers. In today’s challenging economic environment, those looking to climb the corporate ladder in the finance sector can adopt several strategies to enhance their employability. Keeping abreast of emerging trends and understanding how these innovations are reshaping banking operations can provide candidates with a competitive edge. For executives in the finance sector, careers can be significantly enhanced through an Executive MBA (EMBA) programme, which is designed to equip experienced professionals with advanced knowledge and skills tailored to the evolving demands of the industry. One notable programme is the EMBA-Global offered by London Business School (LBS), which focuses on global business leadership and strategic management for individuals working at a senior level and looking to take their careers to the next stage. Founded in the 1960s, LBS opened with the aim of professionalising the country’s management. Today, the EMBA-Global programme, which can be taken on a part-time basis, has been revised to cater to changing market and business needs, allowing students to tailor the programme to their individual needs. Women make up 53% of the most recent EMBA-Global class with 20 different nationalities represented and the school prides itself on admitting exceptional leaders who are looking to learn alongside other talented senior professionals without the need to pause their careers. A unique combination of education and experience, the EMBA-Global is an Executive MBA programme that offers a dynamic vision, peer-to-peer networking, powerful insight, and informed perspective for global business leaders. The curriculum addresses contemporary issues in finance, involving real-life projects and case studies to enhance problem-solving abilities and strategic thinking. Delivered by a world-class faculty, the programme is offered jointly by LBS and Columbia Business School in New York, and upon successful completion of the course, graduates receive two full MBA degrees as well as full membership to both institutions. With the combined expertise of two globally renowned business schools, EMBA-Global alumni also benefit from an extended circle of influence around the world, with professional connections that go beyond traditional networks and often evolve into global ecosystems of collaboration and industry. In joining this powerful alumni network, students are immersed in world-class experiences in both New York City and London where they can sharpen their instincts, hone their skills, glean expert insight into current trends in finance, develop leadership skills, and gain practical experience; a unique combination that positions alumni at the forefront of business leadership and provides a significant edge in an increasingly competitive job market.

What is unknown, however, is how delays and snags to the Blackwell launch will affect January quarter earnings and how, if at all, Nvidia's near-term guidance will reflect that.

The group, which will be established next year, will also include digital assets such as Rotten Tomatoes and Fandango, which, when combined with the other brands in the new 'SpinCo' portfolio, generated around $7 billion in revenues over the three months ending in September. “When you look at our assets, talented management team and balance sheet strength, we are able to set these businesses up for future growth,” said CEO Brain Roberts. “With significant financial resources from day one, will be ideally positioned for success and highly attractive to investors, content creators, distributors and potential partners.” Comcast shares were marked 2.1% higher in premarket trading to indicate an opening bell price of $43.20 each.

During the Great Resignation, companies couldn’t find talent fast enough. That put power in the hands of job seekers across the U.S., and led to some big wage increases. But that seems like a distant memory now. The number of open jobs in September of this year was 2 million less than the same month in 2023, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Workers are struggling to find a job, and more likely to stay put when they have one. “It really feels like the power shifted to the employers,” Glassdoor CEO Christian Sutherland-Wong tells Fortune. “Previously, job seekers had a lot of choices and could easily move between companies. But now they’re holding back, and people stay in their companies longer.” That shift in power dynamics has allowed some companies to start playing hardball with workers on everything from salary negotiations to RTO mandates. This autumn, Amazon made a splash by mandating that workers return to work five days a week beginning in January. Computer company Dell and the Washington Post have made similar pronouncements. But other companies are doing the opposite. Glassdoor went fully remote earlier this year. And despite the recent flurry of big-name companies demanding RTO, Sutherland-Wong believes that remote and hybrid work trends are here to stay. And as for Glassdoor specifically, their decision to be remote has come with some major upsides. “I think the biggest benefit we've seen, being a fully remote workplace, is being able to tap into talent all around the U.S. and all around the globe that we didn't have access to when we were an office-based company,” he tells Fortune. “And that's been a powerful change to the talent we've been able to bring on.” Check out more from Sutherland-Wong in the full interview here.

Analysts are overwhelmingly bullish on the chipmaker's stock, with multiple firms raising their price targets ahead of the report. Wall Street projects strong revenue growth, driven by record data center revenue. Nvidia (NVDA) is set to deliver its highly anticipated earnings after the closing bell Wednesday, with analysts overwhelmingly bullish on the chipmaker's stock. Of the 23 analysts covering Nvidia tracked by Visible Alpha, 22 have a ""buy"" rating for the stock, with one ""hold"" rating. Their consensus price target of $169.77 would represent an over 17% premium over Wednesday's intraday price of $144.66. Several firms raised their price targets in the days ahead of the report, with Stifel analysts bumping their price target earlier this week to $180 from $165.

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting NY Congestion Pricing Survived a Pause. Here’s What Could Kill It Prosecutors have recommended that Hwang, 60, spend more than two decades behind bars, while his lawyers have asked that he be given no prison time at all. The government also wants Hwang to pay $10 billion in restitution, though his lawyers said Monday that he is now worth only around $55 million. US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein will hand down the sentence after a hearing at which both sides, and possibly Hwang himself, will speak. The case pushed into the spotlight a relatively unknown trader who seemingly built a wildly successful firm, only to see it crash in spectacular fashion. Archegos’ implosion also contributed to the demise of one of the biggest names in finance, Credit Suisse Group AG, and caused significant losses at Morgan Stanley, UBS Group AG, Nomura Holdings and other banks. Hwang was found guilty in July of orchestrating a scheme to mislead his counterparties into providing Archegos with billions of dollars in trading capacity. Though the banks were told the firm had large positions in tech giants like Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp., Hwang actually poured its money into a small group of fairly illiquid stocks, most notably the company then known as ViacomCBS, that his trading could move. To maximize his trades’ impact, Hwang typically bought swaps, knowing that his counterparty banks would hedge by directly buying shares. Archegos fell into a fatal spiral after a March 2021 selloff in Viacom shares prompted billions of dollars in margin calls. That the victims were mainly Wall Street banks set Archegos apart from most big white collar cases. Hwang’s lawyers had planned to argue that the banks were sophisticated players who understood the risks of trading with Archegos but took them in order to earn lucrative fees. Hellerstein largely sided with prosecutors in barring a “blame the victim” defense, and that may be a major issue in a planned appeal of his conviction. The defense did manage to occasionally highlight the banks’ profit motives in their dealings with Archegos. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. product specialist Nastassia Locasto testified at trial that her bank initially had questions about Archegos’ holdings but ultimately decided to trade with Hwang’s family office because it knew its Wall Street rivals were making millions in fees. “They were paying our peers,” she said. But such testimony was overshadowed by that of two former Archegos executives who previously pleaded guilty and agreed to cooperate with the government. Former head trader William Tomita and risk head Scott Becker both said they were directed to lie to banks to persuade them to extend more credit to Archegos. Tomita also vividly described how Hwang manipulated markets by directing his team to try to reach price targets that often changed minute by minute. Archegos used “very aggressive” algorithmic trading techniques to ensure it accounted for a very large percentage of the trading volume for the firm’s portfolio stocks, Tomita said. When Goldman’s Locasto questioned him about why the main holders of one of Archegos’ portfolio stocks were other banks, Tomita said he lied. “I painted this picture — this false picture — that other hedge funds were using the capacity and it wasn’t us,” he said. Goldman was one of the few Archegos counterparties that emerged relatively unscathed, and it was revealed at trial that the bank benefited from a huge mistake Archegos made in its frantic final days. Tasked with withdrawing $470 million from its Goldman trading account, an Archegos employee actually wired that amount instead.

Target's sales and profits fell short of estimates, while Walmart's results surpassed expectations in the third quarter. Both retailers said lower prices and convenience features like curbside pickup and same-day delivery are driving sales, but those trends have seemed to benefit Walmart more in recent quarters.

GlobalData’s Electrophysiology Diagnostic Catheters Market Size by Segments, Share, Regulatory, Reimbursement, Procedures and Forecast to 2033 report reveals that US EP catheter market growth will be driven by increasing physician adoption, improved reimbursement policies, rising patient awareness and the launch of next-generation device innovations, highlighting the evolving landscape of cardiac care solutions. EP diagnostic catheters, which are used for intracardiac sensing, recording, stimulation and mapping, are integral to diagnosing and managing arrhythmias. Arrhythmias - characterised by irregular heart rhythms - are increasingly prevalent in the US due to its ageing population and lifestyle-related factors such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity and physical inactivity. The US has the largest EP diagnostic catheter market globally, and benefits from a higher number of facilities and specialists compared to other countries. Advanced EP diagnostic catheters, while costlier, provide superior diagnostic capabilities, supporting their adoption despite price concerns. Market drivers include the growing incidence of arrhythmias, increasing adoption of minimally invasive procedures, and the high effectiveness of EP diagnostic and ablation techniques. Additionally, improvements in catheter accuracy have made EP procedures more reliable, leading to better patient outcomes and reduced recurrence rates. Despite its promising growth trajectory, the market faces notable challenges. The high cost of advanced EP diagnostic catheters could hinder accessibility, particularly in cost-sensitive healthcare settings. Additionally, the growing adoption of reprocessed catheters — priced at nearly 50% less than new devices — creates a significant competitive hurdle for manufacturers. With reprocessing permitted in certain markets, it continues to impact potential revenue streams for original equipment manufacturers. Overall, the US EP diagnostic catheter market's growth will be bolstered by the advances in technology and procedure effectiveness. Continued innovations and cost-effective solutions are likely to address the market barriers and sustain long-term expansion.

Investors “can increase and broaden their allocation to risk assets, seeking potentially higher returns with the potential for adding little to no additional volatility within the overall portfolio.” The Bloomberg US Aggregate Index has gained 1.6% this year through Tuesday, while a stocks rally has rocketed the S&P 500 Index up 24% so far in 2024. “Equities and bonds can complement each other in portfolio construction, and both are likely to benefit in our baseline economic outlook for a soft landing amid continued central bank rate cuts,” they added. The Federal Reserve kicked off its cutting cycle with a half-point reduction in September and then lowered rates by another quarter percentage point earlier this month. Swaps traders are assigning about a 50-50 chance that the US central bank will cut rates again in December as policymakers try to navigate slowing growth without tipping the economy into a recession. Generally, in a soft landing scenario US equities gain into and through the first rate cut but then taper off three months after in the median case, a Pimco analysis of Fed rate-cutting cycles through 1960 showed.

For its multi-asset portfolios, the Newport Beach, California-headquartered firm favors a slight overweight to the US for stocks and on the debt side has a bias for high-quality core bonds, which typically includes investment-grade debt. In equities, investors should focus on US companies with earnings that don’t rely heavily on imports given President-elect Donald Trump’s plans to raise tariffs, they said. Trump has proposed raising tariffs to 60% on goods imported from China and to 20% on items from other countries.

115,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/possibly-earn-huge-158-payout-171530117.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 9:15 AM"," It’s been said that elections have consequences. However, in the case of the second term of President-elect Donald J. Trump, his surprise victory could offer a huge — or is that yuge? — payout for EOG Resources (EOG) investors. As a hydrocarbon upstream specialist, EOG stock should fundamentally benefit from Trump’s public support for U.S. oil production. Therefore, I am bullish on the oil and gas producer. Discover the latest stocks recommended by top Wall Street analysts, all in one place with Analyst Top Stocks Make smarter investments with weekly expert stock picks from the Smart Investor Newsletter Another reason to consider EOG stock is its financial performance. For the third quarter, the underlying company posted solid results, delivering earnings per share of $2.89, beating the estimate calling for $2.78. On the sales front, a total of $5.89 billion was slightly off from expectations of $6 billion. However, management emphasized its “outstanding execution” across its multi-basin portfolio, noting in particular strong volumes and price realizations. With the political tailwind of an oil-friendly presidential administration, those likely aren’t just empty corporate statements. Trump could potentially extend a lifeline to legacy automakers, which in turn may spur more incentives for domestic fossil-fuel production. With this backdrop, EOG stock appears compelling. For those who believe the same, specialized options strategies can help deliver dramatic returns. Typically, bullish retail investors adopt the tried-and-true method of simply buying their target security in the open market. The idea here is quite intuitive: buy low and eventually sell high. However, it can take a long time — especially for an established entity like EOG stock — to move significantly higher. It’s here that many speculators turn to call options, which provide the leverage of 100 shares. However, one of the main challenges of call options is that “realistic” calls — that is, calls that are likely to be profitable prior to expiration — can be quite expensive due to the premiums charged. In technical terms, the investor must pay a debit to buy the desired call. For options to break even, the underlying security must rise to the listed strike price plus the premium paid. An alternative approach is to consider the Bull Call spread. This trade is very similar to buying a call option. However, the difference is that you also simultaneously sell a call at a higher strike. Certainly, the sale of the call caps your maximum profitability potential. At the same time, the credit (income) received from the short call can help offset some of the debit paid for your long call. For a heavily traded optionable security like EOG stock, prospective traders have multiple strike-price combinations to consider. Naturally, a question arises about which call spread to buy. To figure this out, one should establish a baseline trade. In other words, find a relatively conservative trade that is likely to be profitable (assuming the underlying thesis is correct) but still offers enough reward to be interesting. Now, to find this baseline, you should calculate the market’s expected movement for the security. You can do this by conducting a stochastic analysis. The quick-and-dirty approach is as follows: multiply the share price, the implied volatility (IV) of the target options chain, and the time decay adjustment. The end result gives you the expected movement of the stock to the upside or downside. Let’s look at the options chain expiring Dec. 20 as an example. Here, the average IV comes in at 24.86%. The time decay adjustment lands at 30.52. With a share price following Friday’s close of $134.56, the product of the three metrics is almost $10.21. That means EOG stock may rise to $144.77 or slip to $124.35. Since we’re bullish, we’re obviously focusing on the upper price target. Essentially, the market assumes that under ideal conditions, EOG stock may rise to $144.77. However, in actuality, the figure could be higher or lower. Since we’re looking to first establish a baseline trade, we should be conservative and downgrade this max price target when considering the short call strike price. In my opinion, a solid baseline trade to consider is the 130/140 call spread for the options chain expiring Dec. 20. Here, EOG stock only needs to rise above $135.14 to break even.

For the third quarter, underlying company posted solid results, per share of beating the estimate calling for $2.78. On the sales front, a total billion was slightly off from expectations of $6 billion. However, management emphasized its “outstanding execution” across its multi-basin portfolio, particular strong volumes and price realizations. With the political tailwind of an oil-friendly presidential administration, those likely aren’t just empty corporate statements. Trump could potentially extend a to legacy which in turn may spur more incentives for fossil-fuel production. With this backdrop, EOG stock appears For those who believe the same, specialized options strategies help dramatic returns. bullish retail investors the tried-and-true simply buying their target security in the open market. The idea here is quite intuitive: buy low and eventually sell high. However, it can take a long time — especially for an established entity like EOG stock — to move significantly higher. It’s that speculators turn to call options, which provide the leverage of 100 shares. However, one of the main challenges of call options is “realistic” calls — that is, that likely to be profitable to expiration — can be expensive due to the premiums charged. In technical terms, the must pay a debit to buy the call. For options to break even, underlying must rise to the listed strike price plus the premium paid. An alternative approach is to consider the Bull Call spread. This trade is very similar to buying a call option. However, the difference is that you also simultaneously sell a call at higher strike. Certainly, the sale of the call caps your maximum profitability potential. At the same time, the credit (income) received from the short call can help offset some the debit paid for your long call. For a heavily traded optionable security EOG stock, prospective traders have multiple strike-price combinations to consider. Naturally, a question arises about which call spread to buy. To figure this out, one should a baseline trade. In words, find a relatively conservative trade that is likely to be profitable (assuming the underlying thesis is correct) but still offers enough reward to be interesting. Now, to find this baseline, you should the market’s expected movement for the security. You do this conducting a stochastic analysis. The quick-and-dirty approach is as follows: multiply the price, the implied volatility (IV) of the target options chain, the time decay adjustment. The end result gives the expected movement of the stock to the upside or downside. Let’s look at the options chain expiring Dec. 20 as an example. Here, the average IV comes in at 24.86%. The time lands at 30.52. With share price following Friday’s close $134.56, the of the three metrics is almost $10.21. That EOG stock may rise to $144.77 or slip to $124.35. Since we’re bullish, obviously the upper price target. Essentially, the market assumes that under ideal conditions, EOG may rise $144.77. However, in actuality, the figure could be higher or lower. Since we’re looking to first establish a baseline trade, we should conservative and downgrade this max price target when the short call strike price. In my opinion, a solid trade consider is the 130/140 call spread for options chain expiring 20. Here, EOG stock only needs to rise above $135.14 to break even.

Warren Buffett's investment strategy is a case study in bold and safe play. Nearly $99 billion is pegged on two iconic names: Apple and Coca-Cola. Through Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett has reduced his Apple stake significantly in 2024, trimming it by about two-thirds. Berkshire now holds approximately 300 million shares of Apple stock, valued at $69.9 billion as of September, down from 905 million shares at the end of 2023. Despite this, Apple remains Berkshire’s largest equity position, accounting for 28% of the portfolio, as cited by CNBC. Don't Miss: Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target – You can still get 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $1,000 This Adobe-backed AI marketing startup went from a $5 to $85 million valuation working with brands like L'Oréal, Hasbro, and Sweetgreen in just three years – here's how there's a limited time opportunity to invest at $1,000 for only $0.50/share before it closes in a few days His strategy here is simple but powerful – backing companies with brand strength and consistent financials. Apple's stock, for instance, surged 31% this year and many see this as Buffett's savviest move yet. Some say it's his ""crown jewel,"" lauding his foresight in spotting a tech company that's proven as resilient as it is profitable. But as with any big bet, Buffett's heavy reliance on Apple has sparked some chatter. Skeptics say putting so many eggs in one tech basket could be risky. With tech stocks, there's always the threat of shifting consumer trends, not to mention the occasional market shake-up. Trending: The global games market is projected to generate $272B by the end of the year — for $0.55/share, this VC-backed startup with a 7M+ userbase gives investors easy access to this asset market. And while Apple has shown impressive gains this year, the latest numbers hint at a slight cooling. In the last fiscal year, Apple's total revenue dipped by 0.8% – a small shift but enough to raise eyebrows. According to Business Insider, Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring believes Apple has room to climb, setting a price target of $273 from the current $216. Apple's pivot toward services is holding it steady. Though iPhone sales may ebb and flow, Apple's revenues from the App Store, streaming and cloud services have grown by 23% over the past few years. Services have also helped Apple boost its profit margins, going from 43.3% in 2022 to 46.2% in 2024, catching Wall Street's attention. These margins and the cash flow from services make Apple's high share prices easier to swallow, especially as it could mean bigger dividends for shareholders.

119,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hong-kong-property-tycoons-plow-054859880.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 3:30 AM"," (Bloomberg) -- Property tycoons are lending their support to the Hong Kong IPO market for the first time in years, a move that could help fan the flames of a nascent recovery. Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting NY Congestion Pricing Survived a Pause. Here’s What Could Kill It Billionaire Robert Ng’s Sino Land Co. is one of the largest cornerstone investors in the $793 million Hong Kong listing from courier service SF Holding Co. that kicked off this week. An investment vehicle backed by the family of New World Development Co. Chairman Henry Cheng is also among the 10 parties that committed to buy stock in the offering in return for guaranteed allocation. Companies seeking to list in Hong Kong used to regularly solicit backing from local property tycoons, revered as savvy investors in a city whose wealth was built on real estate. The practice waned in recent years as Chinese state-owned enterprises began taking more prominent roles — Hong Kong-based billionaires haven’t been cornerstone investors in any major offering priced in the city after the start of 2022, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. “Having tycoons on a deal like this shows that they have a commitment to Hong Kong, they have a commitment to the Chinese economy, and they have a conviction in the medium to long term,” Andy Maynard, head of equities at China Renaissance Securities, said by phone Wednesday. “It’s a vote of confidence.” The volume of Hong Kong listings has been picking up in recent months after a quiet 2023, with fundraising volumes rising 92% so far this year to $9.1 billion, data compiled by Bloomberg show. SF — known as the FedEx of China — could rank as the city’s second-largest offering this year if it prices at the top end of the marketed range. Already listed in Shenzhen for more than a decade, SF is raising funds in Hong Kong to expand its overseas logistics network. It is planning to sell a combined $205 million worth of shares to cornerstone investors who have agreed to hold the stock for at least six months. The presence of local tycoons in an offering can help drum up interest from other high net worth individuals as well as Hong Kong retail investors, according to Eliot Fisk, a former equity capital markets banker at JPMorgan Chase & Co. who is now a consultant on the sector. Sino Land, the Hong Kong developer that owns the Fullerton hotel chain, is investing $25 million in the SF listing, while the vehicle backed by New World’s Cheng family is putting in $20 million. They’re being joined by Oaktree Capital Management LP, Morgan Stanley, smartphone maker Xiaomi Corp. and China Pacific Insurance Group Co. The tycoons may have been lured by SF’s attractive valuation, said Kenny Wen, head of investment strategy at KGI Asia Ltd. SF is marketing the offering at a discount of as much as 29% to its Shenzhen-listed stock. So far the deal has shown good momentum, with the order books getting covered the same morning it launched. Representatives for Sino Land and the Cheng family’s holding company didn’t respond to requests for comment. Still, sentiment toward new offerings remains “very cautious” unless there’s a big name with a good story to tell, said Alex Wong, director of Alex KY Wong Asset Management Co. While larger share sales have started coming back to Hong Kong, there’s only been one listing above $1 billion this year and fundraising volumes remain well below the heyday of 2020, when $51.7 billion was raised from initial public offerings. A number of IPOs are in the pipeline, including Chinese digital retail platform Dmall Inc., which started gauging investor interest last week. Meanwhile, soy sauce producer Foshan Haitian Flavouring & Food Co. and drugmaker Jiangsu Hengrui Pharmaceuticals Co. are planning second listings in Hong Kong that could each raise well over $1 billion, Bloomberg News has reported. SF’s offering could be a marker of investor appetite for Chinese issuers, according to Lorraine Tan, director of Asia equity research at Morningstar Inc. “If it’s relatively well received, I think it could encourage a few more companies to test the waters,” Tan said. “But if not, it essentially indicates that challenges should persist for the IPO pipeline.” --With assistance from Shawna Kwan and Shirley Zhao.

The company’s new 3-5 year targets offered at its Analyst Day event were slightly better than the firm was expecting, the analyst tells investors in a research note.

120,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cava-mediterranean-chipotle-one-wall-123000340.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 4:30 AM"," Brett Schulman has heard the comparison for years—but the CEO of Cava doesn't mind. After all, his chain's operating model is very similar to a certain famous burrito brand. Besides, Schulman says it's high praise if people want to call Cava ""the Mediterranean Chipotle."" But he urges them to keep an eye on what his firm, known for its lamb meatballs, falafels, and pita chips, is going to do next. “We have this massive white space opportunity in front of us,” he told Fortune last Tuesday, shortly before the company released another blowout round of quarterly earnings. The Street shares his enthusiasm. Investors all seemed to want a piece when Cava went public last June, and the shine is yet to wear off. The stock is up over 300% in the past year, even though shares fell 4% late last week. Some shareholders could be profit-taking—or scared off by a skyrocketing multiple—but many still appear confident they will get what they paid for. Business has recently been tough for most of the restaurant industry, including both traditional dining and fast-food. The fast-casual space, however, has had Wall Street licking its lips in 2024. As the chart below shows, health-conscious brands like Cava and salad chain Sweetgreen have dramatically outperformed the broader market. Even Chipotle—founded in 1993, making it more than 20 years older than Cava—has produced a strong year despite having its star CEO poached by Starbucks in August. For comparison, shares of McDonald’s have lagged well behind the S&P 500. View this interactive chart on Fortune.com The fast-casual players have become staples of the office lunch run in several major U.S. cities, but that’s far from the biggest factor driving their rise. Cava, for example, has 90% of its restaurants in suburban settings, Schulman said, and the lunch-dinner split is almost 50-50. Sharon Zackfia, head of consumer equity research and a partner at investment bank William Blair, seconds the chief executive’s notion that Cava is capitalizing as some consumers trade down—or seek more affordable options—while others increasingly trade up from slightly cheaper fast-food options. The former trend is nothing new, she told Fortune. Over the last 20 years, she explained, sit-down casual dining has lost ground to quick service restaurants as consumers realize they can get an equally tasty burrito or salad at potentially a better price point and in a more convenient format. The much more recent phenomenon, she explained, involves people willing to pay an extra few dollars to forgo their fast-food burger for a salad bowl, especially as the former has become more expensive amid rising prices. New entrants like Cava and Sweetgreen, she said, have been able to replicate their success across various regions and income cohorts. “They're just so early in their growth trajectory,” she said. Analysts congratulating executives on earnings is hardly uncommon but the tone felt especially effusive on Cava's Q3 call last week. That's not a surprise as the chain's revenue grew for a 15th straight quarter, increasing 39% year-over-year to $241.5 million, while quarterly earnings per share came in at $0.15 for a 37% consensus beat, per Bloomberg. Schulman said he’s most proud about foot traffic growing 12.9% at existing restaurants in Q3, which topped the Street’s estimates by 58%. The vision his team started to execute 14 years ago, he said, has reached a tipping point. “[It] shows just how much momentum and appreciation folks have for the brand,” he said, “and how well our cuisine and our value proposition is resonating and meeting the moment for the modern consumer.” Cava went public in June 2023 and is now on track to do over $11 billion in revenue this year, per estimates from Visible Alpha, and its early pace of growth has even eclipsed what Chipotle achieved in its early years as a public company. Cava’s market cap is currently around $16.2 billion, which roughly equates to $46 million for each of its 352 restaurants. By comparison, investors valued Chipotle at about $4 million per restaurant when the same amount of time had passed since its January 2006 IPO (the same year Cava's original three founders decided to launch their first restaurant). Cava’s valuation is also lofty by more traditional measures, with the stock trading at a price 243 times forward earnings, according to estimates from S&P Cap IQ. That's high even compared to the likes of upscale burger joint Shake Shack, which has a forward P/E ratio of 117, let alone a long-established brand like McDonald's trading at 24 times forward earnings. Cava's CEO, though, is confident the valuation is warranted. “They're increasingly confident in our opportunity,” Schulman said of the company's shareholders, “and the more we're able to continue to deliver on that opportunity, it's only growing their confidence.” Cava hopes to operate 1,000 stores by 2032, but Schulman is the first to admit successfully scaling restaurants is no easy feat. The food-poisoning crises that rocked Chipotle in 2015 serve as a warning of what can happen when a chain gets too big too fast. Cava has dealt with some food safety controversies of its own. In September, short-seller Hunterbrook published a report that found two Cava restaurants in Manhattan, including the Wall Street location, had received a grade of “C” from the New York City Department of Health. Those restaurants have since received “A's” on their most recent inspections. The company's stock is up 14% since. ""Food safety is paramount to what we do, it is embedded in our culture, our policies, and our practices,"" Cava said in a statement. Schulman said the company is ready to broaden and deepen its presence in the 25 states in which it operates. Beyond its mid-Atlantic roots, the chain has a heavy footprint in the Sun Belt, as well as in Texas and the Southwest. After launching in Chicago this year, the company is planning on expanding to South Florida and two new markets in the Midwest in 2025. Beyond new locations, Zackfia said the company has also been adept at generating buzz on social media about menu innovations, fitting for a brand that identifies 58% of its customers as Gen Z and Millennials. Her team’s projections for Cava’s earnings before taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) over the next two years are now 80% to 90% above where they sat last summer. “They're basically running at least a year ahead of schedule in terms of sales,” she said.

122,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-weigh-nvidia-earnings-amid-123837954.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 4:38 AM"," Nvidia shares edged higher in early Wednesday trading as investors looked to the AI-chip maker's fiscal-third-quarter earnings after the closing bell with a focus on its demand outlook into the end of the year and beyond. Nvidia  (NVDA) , which holds a commanding 90% share of the market for so-called artificial-intelligence accelerators — the chips and processors that power the massive data systems of hyperscalers such as Microsoft  (MSFT)  and Amazon  (AMZN)  — has added more than $2.2 trillion in market value so far this year. The group has doubled its sales for each of the past five quarters and is on pace for a fiscal 2025 tally of around $126.4 billion. But it is starting to see challenges to its near-term outlook tied to supply constraints and nascent competition from smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices  (AMD) . That won't stop the group from posting another staggering gain in profit, which is estimated to have doubled over the three months ended in October to around $17.4 billion, or another surge in overall revenues. But it could mean a more modest outlook heading into its fiscal fourth quarter and beyond, forcing investors to temper some of their near-term expectations for the world's most-valuable stock. ""Investor focus remains on Nvidia's ability to continue to increase guidance well ahead of expectations,"" said Logan Purk, technology analyst at Edward Jones. ""These guidance numbers provide data points for the potential for AI demand."" Shutterstock Nvidia, which is expected to post overall revenue 83% above the year-earlier third quarter to $31.16 billion, is likely to see that growth rate slow to around 66% over the three months ending in January. Much will depend on its ability to overcome supply-chain snarls and some early design flaws in its newly released line of Blackwell processors, which are faster and more energy-efficient, and to deliver the ""several billions"" in sales that finance chief Colette Kress promised investors earlier this year. Wall Street forecasts for fiscal-fourth-quarter Blackwell revenue range from around $5 billion to as high as $8 billion, ""Nvidia heads into earnings with elevated expectations,"" said Hightower's chief investment officer, Stephanie Link. ""The stock is up 172% year to date and 5% over the past month, with anticipation of a beat-and-raise tempered by potential revenue deceleration as the market awaits the [next-generation] Blackwell product."" Related: Nvidia earnings on deck as AI kingpin tightens grip against rivals ""It’s important to weigh Nvidia’s long-term growth prospects against the elevated expectations baked into its current valuation,"" she added. Analysts largely agree on the group's longer-term prospects, however, and have faith in its ability to overcome the supply constraints early next year and deliver on what CEO Jensen Huang has called the ""insane"" demand for Blackwell. Nvidia's biggest customers, which include Meta Platforms  (META)  and Google parent Alphabet  (GOOGL)  as well as Amazon and Microsoft, have already committed to spending around $200 billion on AI-related projects this year. These hyperscalers are the major providers of cloud computing infrastructure and services. That tally is expected to rise to around $270 billion next year in what Amazon CEO Andy Jassy called a ""once-in-a-lifetime"" opportunity in generative AI. Total AI spending, which includes software, hardware and services, is likely to more than double to around $632 billion by 2028 from around $235 billion in 2023, according to IDC estimates. That could leave Nvidia in what Morgan Stanley describes as a ""transition quarter"" over the three months ending in January, as Blackwell delays and supply constraints temper near-term forecasts, ""but long-term confidence remains strong for Blackwell-driven growth."" Related: Nvidia to reap billions in big tech AI spending KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst John Vinh also notes that Nvidia's H20 chip, designed to meet U.S. export restrictions on high-tech exports to China, could face both domestic competition as well as a nascent challenge from AMD's new MI308 chip. He also noted the recent swapping of power providers to its Blackwell server rack, with Infineon  (IFNNY)  reportedly replacing Monolithic Power  (MPWR)  as an added near-term supply headwind. ""We expect Nvidia to report strong [fiscal-third-quarter] results, which will solidly beat, driven by strong demand for Hopper, and guide F4Q modestly above consensus expectations,"" he said. But Vinh added that the ""lack of more meaningful upside could pressure Nvidia near term."" Options traders, as a result, are bracing for big swings in Nvidia's stock price and see moves of around 9% in either direction when it reports after the close of trading. Related: Analysts revise Nvidia stock price targets as supply players update outlook With a market value of $3.6 trillion, that could mean lost or added value of around $320 billion in after-hours trading alone.

To receive daily news and insights, subscribe to our free daily Agriculture Dive newsletter. The U.S. Department of Agriculture on Tuesday announced more than $2 billion for specialty crop growers to expand markets and respond to natural disasters through increased access to storage facilities. The funding creates two new programs for vegetable, fruit and tree nut farmers across the country. The Marketing Assistance Program for Specialty Crops initiative will provide $2 billion to defray costs of entering new markets for farmers who often have to pay more to transport delicate and perishable crops. The USDA is also creating a new Commodity Storage Assistance Program, offering $140 million for farmers to access commercial storage facilities in the wake of natural disasters. The program is largely aimed at farmers who saw their operations devastated following Hurricanes Debbie, Helene and Milton. Specialty crop growers are hoping for big funding increases in the upcoming farm bill to enhance competitiveness, respond to disease threats and expand research initiatives. But with farm bill progress stalled, the USDA has looked to make up some of those gaps through new trade initiatives and funding programs. USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack said its newest programs are urgently needed in the wake of devastating hurricanes that wreaked havoc on citrus, blueberry and pecan farms across the Southeast. “From providing high-quality, nutritious, American-grown fruits, vegetables, and nuts to our nation and the world, to serving as economic pillars of their communities, specialty crop producers play a critical role in the success of U.S. agriculture,” Vilsack said in a statement. Applications for both new programs are expected to open in December. To access the Commodity Storage Assistance Program, producers will need to show that natural disasters caused a loss in commercial storage or marketing. Groups representing specialty crop growers welcomed the announcement, but said the additional funding underscores a need for long-term investments through a new farm bill. The Specialty Crop Farm Bill Alliance, made up of dozens of specialty crop groups around the United States, called the programs ""a step in the right direction"" to address high labor and input costs, in addition to increased competition from cheaper imports. While the funding will help ""growers recover from some of this economic battering,"" a new farm bill is needed to help expand the sector. ""The status quo is not sustainable, and the comparatively modest investments we've requested for the farm bill would be transformational to the specialty crop industry,” the alliance said in a statement."," story originally on Agriculture Dive.

127,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/home-insurance-market-turning-creative-131855649.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 5:18 AM"," Climate change and the extreme weather it brings present a serious conundrum for property and casualty insurance carriers. It’s prompting them to pursue different approaches to writing policies—but there’s no one-size-fits-all option. Insurers evaluate both the frequency and the severity of extreme weather events to determine the extent of coverage and premium rates. In other words, they assess how often severe weather occurs and what the potential impact may be. Because of climate change, extreme weather events are happening more often, and at greater intensity, across the U.S. In 2023, there were a record 28 storms that each cost at least $1 billion in damages. Eight of the 10 largest wildfires in California's recorded history have occurred since 2017, contributing to rate increases amounting to $8.5 billion since 2015. Convective storms have been wreaking havoc across the Midwest— and much of the U.S.—leading to a record number of damage claims from hailstorms in 2023. Hurricane Beryl caused significant damage and tragic loss of life in Texas, including an estimated $28-32 billion in total damages and economic losses. This year, some estimates put the damages from hurricanes Helene and Milton at almost $50 billion each. Homeowners' insurance claim costs have risen significantly, with many insurers reporting increases of 20% to 40% on average over the past few years. In catastrophe-prone areas, these increases can be even higher. For claims related to natural disasters such as hurricanes, wildfires, and floods, the costs have risen even more sharply. For example, wildfire-related claims in California have seen costs increase by over 50%. As a result, property owners with catastrophe-exposed homes are experiencing dramatic increases in premiums, often exceeding 100% across the country. This surge in insurance costs is placing a significant financial burden on homeowners, prompting many to consider alternative risk management strategies. To cope with the skyrocketing premiums, many policy owners are opting to increase their deductibles, taking on more financial responsibility in the event of a claim. This approach can provide immediate premium relief but requires homeowners to be prepared for higher out-of-pocket expenses if a loss occurs. Additionally, some property owners are turning to self-insurance (assuming the responsibility for a certain level of risk or loss) for a substantial portion of their property portfolios, particularly for high-value assets or secondary homes. Many insurers are rethinking where they write business—and how they can ensure they’re charging an appropriate rate. Carriers are also adopting a more proactive perspective, focusing more on the prevention of damage that leads to claims. For instance, many carriers are making underwriting requirements more stringent. Instead of suggesting preventative measures on the part of the consumer, they’re now mandating them. Where they once may have recommended adding shutters, for example, they’re now requiring them. There are incentives or credits available to help policyholders meet new, tougher underwriting requirements that potentially transform uninsurable properties into insurable risks for carriers. Some carriers are also rolling out non-renewing policies or leaving certain states completely. For example, State Farm has non-renewed about 30,000 policies in California this year and has also stopped accepting new policy applications. Farmers, Progressive, and AAA are pulling back in Florida. In fact, the Sunshine State has the highest home insurance rates in the country. In the high-net-worth space, there’s been a significant increase in the amount of exposure and risk for carriers. Insurers are required to hold more capital to cover potential large-scale losses, particularly in segments where assets and liabilities are significantly higher. Capital requirements have increased by approximately 10% to 15% in some regions. This means the capital needed to cover policies and potential claims is much higher. Consequently, carriers are now offering a range of different products to serve the high-net-worth cohort. One such product is a blanket property program. It entails policies that cover multiple homes, not just one policy for one home. Risk is spread, creating more cost efficiencies. More common on the commercial side, this kind of product is beginning to take off on the residential side. Another emerging product is parametric insurance. This triggers in the event of a severe weather storm that happens in the holder’s general region. So, instead of having an adjuster visit the home and assess the damage, there’s an automatic calculation for what will be paid out. The insurance market is also seeing a significant shift from admitted policies to non-admitted policies. Unlike admitted policies, which are regulated by the state, non-admitted policies offer more flexibility in terms of coverage and pricing. Non-admitted policies often have higher premiums because they provide coverage for higher-risk properties or unique circumstances that admitted carriers may not cover. These higher risks necessitate higher prices to compensate. But this also means they carry more risk for the policyholder, as they do not have the same level of regulatory oversight and may not be backed by state insurance guaranty funds. So, what does this all mean for homeowners and policyholders in the U.S.? How might they deal with the new scarcity of, limits on, and higher expense of coverage due to severe weather? Be proactive. Policyholders should prioritize preventative measures and risk management. Working with a trusted advisor can help build against future loss. Remember: Mitigation is key. For example, installing an automatic water shut-off valve or a low-temperature sensor can prevent significant claims by detecting issues early and shutting off the water supply, reducing the risk of extensive damage. Be creative. It’s important to take a critical look at all policy options. Insurance advisors and carriers can offer innovative solutions to insure properties. In one example, we collaborated with the owners of a registered historic home in Colorado facing policy cancellation due to a flammable roof. But the local historical society wouldn’t agree to the roof replacement. An expert intervened and found a suitable material that would also pass the aesthetic requirements of the historical society, enabling the home to remain insured. Be realistic. Property owners and policyholders should approach insurance discussions with realistic expectations. While these conversations will vary from region to region, some key questions to consider include: What coverage options are available, and do they align with my property's specific needs? What is my budget for insurance, and how does it influence my choices?What level of risk am I willing to accept? For instance, am I comfortable with higher deductibles or less comprehensive coverage? Would self-insuring a portion of the property's value make sense, and what are the potential implications? Answering these questions will help you make informed decisions, ensuring your property is adequately protected while aligning with your financial goals. The severity and frequency of claims will likely continue to increase with climate change. However, policyholders can effectively manage and mitigate their risks by staying informed and proactive.

Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up by about the same measure. Once the pillar of this two-year bull market, semiconductors have been a net drag on US stocks over the last four months. Nvidia (NVDA) earnings — coming after the bell Wednesday — will provide a reality check on just how important the AI poster child (and its cousins) are to this rally. Tom Essaye, founder and president of the Sevens Report, recently joined Yahoo Finance and broke down the key elements traders are looking for in Nvidia earnings Wednesday. ""It's all about the guidance. How enthusiastic and how aggressive [Nvidia is] on the guidance,"" said Essaye. ""It's a growth story here. We all know it. It's the future. It's the next big thing. They've got to keep us excited about it via this earnings print."" Nvidia has roared back strong since its July slump, rising 45% from the major August low. The chip stock — up nearly 200% this year and up over 1100% in the last two years — hit record highs following the election. But many of Nvidia's peers, especially smaller ones, have become a net drag on the industry and US stocks writ large since the start of the second half of the year. The worst-off among this group of chip stocks, Super Micro Computer (SMCI), faces idiosyncratic problems as it struggles to avoid delisting on the Nasdaq exchange. Qorvo (QRVO) is down over 40%, as is Mobileye Global (MBLY) in the second half of the year so far. Meanwhile, Intel (INTC), Micron (MU), KLA Corp (KLAC), Applied Materials (AMAT), and Microchip (MCHP) are all down more than 20%. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) — seen as Nvidia's biggest competitor — is down 14%. The PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX), which tracks chip industry stocks, has fluctuated for several months. And a fresh two-month low on Monday this week made some technical traders nervous. To be fair, the US rally has already broadened in the third and fourth quarters far beyond the influence of chip stocks, and that's likely to continue next year, as Josh Schafer wrote Monday. ""Nvidia is not the full market driver that it was, say, earlier [in the rally],"" said Essaye. Since the second quarter, Tech (XLK) has been the second-worst-performing sector after Healthcare (XLV), barely in positive territory. Accordingly, investors might wonder if this bull market can continue if tech suddenly becomes an anchor on the S&P 500. And should Nvidia — ""priced to perfection"" according to many analysts — underdeliver and underwhelm, investors may face that reckoning. But Essaye is willing to overlook some of the recent weakness in this ""bellwether"" stock, citing pre-earnings jitters. It's hard not to be optimistic, based on the momentum of the past two years.

Walmart CFO John David Rainey hinted in an interview with Yahoo Finance’s Brian Sozzi on Tuesday that Trump’s tariff promises would prompt the retailer to hike costs, pointing to the impact of higher tariffs enacted during the president-elect's first term under his “America First” agenda. “If we look back historically when tariffs were enacted seven years ago, it did result in higher prices for customers,” Rainey said. Trump has promised to implement tariffs at levels unseen since the Great Depression, including 10%-20% tariffs across the board and a 60% tariff on goods from China. Such policies would push down US GDP by as much as 2.3% after two years, according to a report from the nonpartisan Tax Foundation. During Trump’s first presidency, his administration enacted tariffs on thousands of products equating to $80 billion worth of taxes on Americans, the Tax Foundation found. Following its earnings report on Tuesday, Walmart told Reuters in a statement: ""We're concerned that significantly increased tariffs could lead to increased costs for our customers at a time when they are still feeling the remnants of inflation."" Walmart spokesperson Molly Blakeman reiterated the sentiment in a conversation with Yahoo Finance Tuesday afternoon. Blakeman noted that while Walmart sources two-thirds of its products domestically and has been navigating higher tariffs for years, the levels to which Trump has proposed raising tariffs has caused ""concern."" Fellow retailer Lowe’s also noted that Trump's proposed tariffs would raise the costs of producing goods. “Roughly 40% of our cost of goods sold are sourced outside of the US, and that includes both direct imports and national brands through our vendor partners,” said CFO Brandon Sink in a call with investors on Tuesday. “And as we look at potential impact, certainly would add product costs, but timing and details remain uncertain at this point.” Both Lowe's and Walmart reported earnings on Tuesday morning. Trump has suggested using his proposed tariffs to fund government programs rather than income taxes. The president-elect has also said he believes his strategy would support domestic manufacturing, and his campaign has denied that import taxes would create short-term pains for consumers. On the other hand, the incoming president’s pick for commerce secretary, Cantor Fitzgerald chairman and CEO Howard Lutnick, has contended that the higher duties would result in higher prices. But he has also said he believes the tariffs would bolster purchases of domestically produced goods. Read more: How do tariffs work, and who really pays them? “I think tariffs make sense,” Lutnick told CNBC in a September interview. ""It will drive growth in America.” It remains to be seen whether Trump will deliver on his tariff promises. Citi analysts said in a note earlier this month that Trump's 60% tariff proposal on China is ""more likely to be a bargaining chip than a real risk."" In the meantime, retailers are bracing for a new reality. Outside of Walmart and Lowe’s, Amer Sports (AS) said Tuesday that Trump 2.0 tariffs would raise prices for tennis racquets, baseball bats, and basketballs. ""Our Ball & Racquet segment would be most impacted, predominantly tennis rackets, baseball bats, and basketballs,"" said CFO Andrew Page on an earnings call Tuesday. ""We have some degree of flexibility to adjust our supply chain, but price increases will be the primary tool we utilize should tariffs occur.""

131,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-the-affordable-care-act-is-in-real-trouble-this-time-140058363.html,"Sun, Nov 17, 2024, 6:00 AM"," In the leadup to this month’s election, House Speaker Mike Johnson promised that Republicans would make “massive” changes to the Affordable Care Act if they won a government sweep. With a trifecta now in hand, the party will soon have its chance to make good on that vow. So far, GOP leaders have been vague about what exactly they might do. During his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris, President-elect Donald Trump notoriously said he had only “concepts of a plan” for how to deal with the health care law, which his party failed to repeal and replace after a grueling, months-long effort during his first term in office. But there’s at least one key reason to think that this time will turn out differently: A major expansion of the Affordable Care Act’s insurance subsidies passed by the Biden administration is currently set to expire after 2025, which will lead to large premium and deductible increases for many Americans who get their health coverage through the program’s exchanges. That means Republicans could pare back Obamacare without lifting a finger. But the looming subsidy cliff might also give the party political cover to make broader changes that would otherwise be difficult for more moderate lawmakers to swallow. Democrats temporarily made Obamacare’s insurance tax credits more generous as part of President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan. Those changes to the law’s subsidies, which lower the cost of health coverage purchased on federal marketplaces, knocked premiums to zero for many lower-income families while further limiting their out-of-pocket expense. They also for the first time capped the price of insurance for Americans who earn more than 400% of the federal poverty line, equal to $124,800 for a family of four today. Since then, enrollment on the exchanges has jumped about 80%, from 11.9 million in 2021 to 21.4 million in 2024. Much of that growth came from poorer and moderate-income households, some of whom had previously fallen into the law’s coverage gap because they earned too little to qualify for marketplace subsidies but lived in states that declined to expand Medicaid. Democrats extended the changes through next year as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, but chose not to make them permanent in order to limit that legislation’s cost. Instead, lawmakers hoped that the beefed up subsidies could be renewed as part of the bigger negotiation over the tax code that’s looming next year, when parts of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act are also set to expire. With Republicans in full control of the White House and Capitol Hill, however, a renewal seems unlikely. Allowing Biden’s subsidies to sunset would make Obamacare coverage more expensive across the board — Households currently pay 44% less for health plans on average than they would under the original law’s subsidy scheme, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. The think tank finds that a single 45-year-old making $40,000 a year would pay an extra 67% for a mid-tier silver plan, or $1,247 a year. A similar adult earning $65,000 a year would pay 17% more, or $941. Some larger, middle-class families could be facing thousands of dollars in sticker shock. The Urban Institute finds that among all households earning more than 400% of the poverty line, the cost of coverage would be $2,900 higher without the enhanced subsidies, since they’d once again be forced to pay their full premium without any government assistance. Experts expect price hikes would lead some Americans to drop their coverage, while others would downgrade to cheaper plans. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that in total, 3 million more Americans would likely go uninsured. “There’s a record number of people enrolled in the marketplaces right now,” said Sara Collins, a senior scholar and vice president for health coverage at the Commonwealth Fund. “Letting these enhanced marketplace premium tax credits expire would be a significant blow to low- and middle-income people who depend on them.” With fewer customers to spread around the costs of claims, insurance companies may also have to raise their premiums higher than if Biden’s subsidies remained in place. But the marketplaces aren’t likely to see the same kind of turbulence they did early on under Presidents Obama and Trump, when money-losing insurers dramatically increased their prices year-after-year and dropped out of some markets. “I’m not necessarily expecting a return to those really volatile days of premiums skyrocketing because that was driven by insurers being unprofitable and having to adjust,” said Kaiser Family Foundation vice president Cynthia Cox. Republicans may go beyond simply letting Biden’s enhanced subsidies expire. House Budget Committee Chair Jodey Arrington has called on his party to find savings in federal health care programs, and some members will likely eye cuts to the ACA or Medicaid as a way to offset the cost of their tax plans. While GOP lawmakers haven’t revealed much in the way of specific plans for Obamacare, the legislation they considered in 2017 may offer a guide. The party sought to slash spending on both the ACA and Medicaid by converting their currently unlimited funding into capped block grants to states that would grow more slowly than the programs are currently expected to. They also sought to loosen regulations requiring insurance companies to cover certain benefits. In September, Vice President-elect J.D. Vance suggested Republicans would also seek to allow insurance companies to separate healthy customers and people with pre-existing conditions into separate risk pools. That could make insurance cheaper for many families, but more expensive for those facing health problems. Jordan Weissmann is a senior reporter at Yahoo Finance.

On Monday night, Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin initiated a 2025 year-end S&P 500 target of 6,500, representing about an 11% gain in the benchmark index from current levels. The call falls in line with the 6,500 projection Morgan Stanley made the day prior and just shy of BMO Capital Markets' 2025 year-end target of 6,700. ""In our baseline macro outlook, the economy and earnings continue to grow and bond yields remain around current levels,"" Kostin wrote. ""But event risk remains high heading into 2025, including from the potential threat of an across-the-board tariff and the potential risk from even higher bond yields."" Kostin and others say the market could surge higher even without the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks' massive outperformance. His work shows that the combination of Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) outperformed the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500 by 63 percentage points in 2023 and 22 percentage points thus far this year. In 2024, this was driven by Magnificent Seven earnings outperforming the rest of the index by 30 percentage points. But that margin is projected to fall to just 6 percentage points in 2025, per consensus estimates. This, Kostin believes, will lead to that cohort beating the other 493 stocks by just 7 percentage points in 2025, the narrowest level of outperformance from the Magnificent Seven dating back to 2018. ""The narrowing differential in earnings growth rates should correspond with a narrowing in relative equity returns,"" Kostin wrote. ""Although the 'micro' earnings growth story supports continued ‘Magnificent 7’ outperformance, more 'macro' factors such as economic growth and trade policy lean in favor of the S&P 493.""' Within this call for a broadening of stock market performance within the S&P 500, Goldman also argues that the stocks leading the artificial intelligence trade may begin to shift. Goldman believes gains will shift from a group it has dubbed AI ""infrastructure,"" which includes companies on the ground floor of AI like Nvidia (NVDA), to a group of companies that will have ""enabled revenues"" from AI, meaning those that can use AI to drive sales but aren't actually selling things like AI chips to other companies. The largest companies by market cap in Goldman's enabled revenues basket are Meta and Apple. In the outlook named after Donald Trump's ""Art of the Deal,"" Kostin recommends owning stocks that could be exposed to a pickup in M&A under the president-elect's administration as well as companies who benefit from a pickup in activity among small and medium-size businesses. Kostin cited a pickup in the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB) small business optimism index back in November 2016 when Trump was first elected. Goldman identified a list of 60 companies with at least 50% of revenues tied to small businesses. Large companies in that cohort include Meta, Deere & Company (DE), and Waste Management (WM). ""It was truly a reflection of 'animal spirits' coming to life and this behavior is likely to be repeated now that Donald Trump has been elected to serve as the 47th President from January 2025 to January 2029,"" Kostin wrote. ""The valuation of [small business]-exposed stocks reflects the current depressed level of small business sentiment. We expect an improving small business operating environment will boost the sentiment and spending of [small businesses] in 2025 and lift the earnings and valuation of stocks with revenues tied to that spending.""

The news comes ahead of the AI chipmaker's earnings report, which is slated for release after the market close on Wednesday. It's not the first time issues have been reported with the company's Blackwell products. In August, the Information reported that the leading AI chipmaker was dealing with design flaws related to the individual Blackwell chips themselves. Nvidia confirmed fears that Blackwell production would be delayed in its earnings report in late August, stating that production of the chips would ramp up in the December quarter rather than its previously stated goal to ramp during the September period. The company has not publicly confirmed any design flaws or overheating issues. Nvidia told Yahoo Finance about its latest AI servers: ""The engineering iterations are normal and expected."" Nvidia's so-called GB200 NVL72 server system uses 72 Blackwell chips and 36 of its latest Grace CPUs. Nvidia said the servers are ""the most advanced computers ever created."" Those Blackwell chips are set to bring in ""several billion dollars"" in sales in the company's fiscal fourth quarter, according to CEO Jensen Huang. Customers looking to use the Blackwell server system include Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Elon Musk's xAI, according to the Information. Despite reported issues, Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell noted in a post on X Monday, following the Information's report, that Dell is already shipping an unspecified number of Nvidia's Blackwell servers as part of its latest AI hardware product, the PowerEdge System. Nvidia shares closed Monday down 1.3% to $140.15. As Yahoo Finance’s Dan Howley noted last week, even a stellar report and outlook from the company Wednesday could send its stock down further. Nvidia topped expectations across the board in its most recent quarterly report, for example, but shares still fell 6% immediately after it announced its results in late August. Investor excitement over AI spending has also stoked fears Big Tech’s AI spending will ease — or sharply decline — punching AI chip companies in the gut. Such fears were on display last Friday, when chip stocks fell across the board after a disappointing earnings report from Applied Materials (AMAT), which makes tech used by TSMC (TSM) to manufacture advanced computing chips such as Nvidia’s. Nvidia shares closed Friday down 3.3%, while the PHLX Semiconductor Index (^SOX) fell 3.4%. Still, Nvidia shares are up roughly 186% from last year. The chipmaker's monumental rise has pushed it past Apple (AAPL) as the world's most valuable company, and Nvidia recently replaced Intel on the Dow.

Bakkt stock gained over 162% on Monday following the report. The company is majority-owned by NYSE parent company Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). President-elect Donald Trump maintains a roughly 60% interest in DJT, which boasts a market cap of around $7.1 billion. Trump reiterated earlier this month that he has no intention of selling his stock in the company. Trump's election win has pushed bitcoin prices to all-time highs, with the administration viewed as generally more friendly to the alternative asset class. In July, Trump attended a bitcoin conference in Nashville and has since pledged to usher in more supportive regulation. His promises also include appointing a crypto Presidential Advisory Council and firing current SEC Chair Gary Gensler. On Monday, bitcoin (BTC-USD) rose over 2% to trade just below $92,000 a token. Other crypto-adjacent names were also on the move higher. Shares of MicroStrategy (MSTR), which owns nearly 280,000 bitcoins, closed almost 13% higher after it announced the purchase of an additional 51,780 bitcoins for $4.6 billion. The company now holds $16.5 billion worth of bitcoin. Coinbase (COIN) stock also jumped over 6% on Monday, with the Wall Street Journal reporting its CEO, Brian Armstrong, was set to meet with Trump. Bakkt, which has a market cap of around $190 million, has seen its stock fall sharply since going public in 2021. Intercontinental Exchange, its majority owner, is led by CEO Jeff Sprecher, who is married to former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler, co-chair of Trump's inaugural committee. Trump founded Truth Social after he was kicked off major social media apps like Facebook (META) and Twitter, now X, following the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riots. Trump has since been reinstated on those platforms. He officially returned to posting on X in mid-August after about a year's hiatus. As Truth Social attempts to take on social media incumbents, the fundamentals of the company have long been in question. On Nov. 5, just a few hours before the polls closed, DJT dropped third quarter results that revealed a net loss of $19.25 million for the quarter ending Sept. 30. DJT also reported revenue of $1.01 million. It held about $370 million in cash at the end of the quarter. The stock is up 10% over the last month.

136,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/inside-a-400-billion-bet-on-the-brain-computer-interface-revolution-150057794.html,"Mon, Nov 18, 2024, 7:00 AM"," Computer chips are coming to a brain near you — and sooner than you think. At least that's according to a report by investment bank Morgan Stanley, which estimates the brain-computer interface (BCI) market could be the next opportunity for investors, with a total addressable market of $400 billion. ""This is, to us, the next big opportunity in med tech — and it's rare,"" Morgan Stanley analyst Kallum Titchmarsh told Yahoo Finance. ""BCIs have been in development for 100 years essentially. When you are five years away from full commercial launches, I think it's time to get excited and get ahead of the curve."" Titchmarsh covers medical technology stocks, such as Inari Medical (NARI), Penumbra (PEN), Sight Sciences (SGHT), Irhythm Technologies (IRTC), Nevro (NVRO), Inspire Medical Systems (INSP), and Embecta (EMBC), at Morgan Stanley. The report, published last month, estimates the commercial launch of BCIs in about five years. ""On our numbers, we expect just under $1.5 billion of revenue to be generated from BCI implant procedures out to 2035 (hitting north of a $500 million annual run rate in 2036), and hitting the $1 billion annual run rate by 2041,"" the report said. ""To us, these numbers seem very plausible, particularly when compared to existing med tech end markets..."" Analysts told Yahoo Finance that several neuro-technology companies are vying to be the Apple (AAPL) of their industry. Titchmarsh estimates the penetration will be limited in the first 20 years of launch — likely sitting at less than 3% by 2045. ""But still, this is such a large target market, you don't really need too much penetration to be generating quite significant revenues,"" he said. Morgan Stanley broke the market into two categories: enabling BCIs and preventative BCIs. Enabling BCIs would help patients who have already lost their ability to move or speak as a result of a severe neurological disease or traumatic injury. Preventative BCIs would stop conditions such as depression and epilepsy. Initial applications will help those with motor neuron disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (40,000 and 30,000 people), spinal cord injury (300,000), stroke (900,000), multiple sclerosis (1 million), cerebral palsy (500,000), limb amputation (2.5 million), epilepsy (3 million), and depression (21 million, 2.5 million with severe treatment-resistant). ""In the future, there will be no phones, just Neuralinks,"" Elon Musk posted on X, formerly Twitter, in June. Musk co-founded BCI company Neuralink in 2016, which is now valued at a reported $8 billion. There are several others making big strides that are backed by the richest people in the world. Synchron, a company that implants its chip through the blood vessels with no drilling of the skull, has its Series C funding round backed by Microsoft (MSFT) co-founder Bill Gates and Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos. The company has an estimated valuation of about $400 million. Palantir (PLTR) co-founder and venture capitalist Peter Thiel has poured at least $10 million into Blackrock Neurotech, which sports a valuation of a reported $350 million. German billionaire Christian Angermayer is on the board of Blackrock Neurotech and is also an investor. Titchmarsh is focusing on four players he says currently lead the pack: Neuralink, Synchron, Precision Neuroscience, and Paradromics. ""I think being first is super important,"" Titchmarsh said, adding that whichever company is first to market will get the foothold on reimbursement. ""It's rare to see four or five players in a med tech space compete. It is more likely we'll see probably three."" He expects that within the first few years of a commercial launch, the market will be narrowed down to three key players. Beyond that the likelihood of acquisitions by public companies is high. ""Three large companies have neuromodulation businesses: Medtronic, Abbott, and Boston Scientific,"" Titchmarsh said. ""But this seems very unique of a market, and it may actually be better in the hands of these companies as kind of pure plays for now so that it doesn't get lost in the broader development pipeline. Would I be surprised in 10 years if one of these large med tech companies had a BCI? Not at all."" Last month, Precision Neuroscience closed a $93 million funding round, valuing the startup at around $500 million. ""We view brain-computer interfaces as a generationally important life sciences innovation and one that really is ... going to have applicability today in paralysis, tomorrow in a number of different areas,"" Michael Mager, co-founder and CEO of Precision Neuroscience, told me at Yahoo Finance's Invest conference (video above). ""We tried to build this company from the very beginning to go the distance."" Catch more in-depth conversations from Yahoo Finance's Invest conference Precision has temporarily implanted its device, called the Layer 7 Cortical Interface, into more than two dozen patients during clinical trials. The company uses a minimally invasive approach that doesn't penetrate the brain like its competitors. Precision Neuroscience's co-founder and chief science officer, Benjamin Rapoport (formerly of Neuralink), said the technology goes beyond med tech. ""There's an aspect of it that is novel manufacturing techniques,"" Rapoport, a practicing neurosurgeon, told Yahoo Finance. ""There's an aspect of it that is supply chain related. There's a significant aspect of it that's artificial intelligence and machine learning-driven. We're pushing so many limits on all these fronts that there's not really any other, to date, field or technology in medicine that has required innovation on so many levels at the same time."" Precision is awaiting FDA approval to implant its chip in patients for up to 30 days. Rapoport expects the cost of a BCI to be six figures. ""For the economic impact on a young person, who has probably 50 years of life and maybe 35 years of work ahead of them, what you're giving them and their family is a level of independence and economic self-sufficiency,"" Rapoport said. ""And that's worth a year or two salary — I think most people would agree."" Yasmin Khorram is a senior reporter at Yahoo Finance. Follow Yasmin on Twitter/X @YasminKhorram and on LinkedIn.

(Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.) Rowan, who is now being floated as a potential Treasury Secretary pick in the incoming Trump administration, added that the ""market's verdict's been rendered.” “I think this administration has a remarkable chance to really pivot the country to take advantage of all the inherent positives that we have,” Rowan said. Rowan’s optimism matches that of the market, with the S&P 500 rallying above 6,000 in the best post-election day melt-up of all time. Experts say the rally is based in part on Trump's policy proposals around making tax cuts permanent and loosening regulations. But that rally and optimism may be ignoring a tariffs-led headwind. The top 100 firms in the S&P 500 by market cap get 8% of their revenue on average from China. If Trump’s proposed 60% tariff on Chinese imports comes to fruition, profit margins and stock prices could slip, though it’s more likely tariffs will double from current levels, according to Bloomberg Economics. Read more: How do tariffs work, and who really pays them? It's a concern Deutsche Bank chief US economist Matthew Luzzetti echoed on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast. “Markets are telling you more or less Donald Trump means somewhat good for growth, somewhat inflationary,” Bridgewater Associates co-chief investment officer Karen Karniol-Tambour said at Invest, warning that immigration restrictions and a lift to the deficit are inflationary. To understand when the deficit devil over the shoulder becomes a zombie in front of you, BlackRock’s Rick Rieder watches foreign demand at Treasury auctions. Despite these risks and elevated equity multiples, he’s still bullish. ""The technicals for equities are crazy, … crazy good,"" Rieder said at Invest. ""I've learned over my career the technicals win. ... Even if you believe in the fundamentals, the technicals win more."" An easing cycle from the Federal Reserve that the market believes could bring the US to a soft landing also doesn’t hurt. Though Judy Shelton, a former economic adviser and Trump appointee to the Fed, didn’t want to throw the Fed a victory party anytime soon. “We’ve gone through the worst inflation in 40 years, and when it comes to accountability … I don’t think that anyone got fired at the Fed,” Shelton said at the conference. Shelton also called into question the Fed’s role moving forward. “I think this is an interesting time when people are looking at the appropriate role of the Federal Reserve … and maybe rethinking whether we want … [the interest rate and the price of capital] to be set by a dozen people voting eight times a year,” Shelton said, adding she is also optimistic on the next Trump presidency. Bank of America (BAC) CEO Brian Moynihan sees potential policies under Trump as being economically favorable. ""I think what's really driving the fundamental activity in the economy is the things that make America great,"" Moynihan explained. ""Capitalism.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) closed down about 0.3% but still recovered from earlier session lows. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) battled back to finish the day up 0.4% after the index fell below its election breakout level in early trade. But the big winner was the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), which reversed declines to gain over 1%. The index was aided by shares of Nvidia, which rose nearly 5% following a series of bullish notes from Wall Street analysts ahead of its anticipated earnings results on Wednesday. The gains come just one day after the stock was bruised by a report of overheating issues with its flagship new AI product. Earlier in the trading day, investors assessed news that President Vladimir Putin had signed a revised nuclear doctrine that allows Russia to expand its use of atomic weapons. It comes just days after President Joe Biden gave Ukraine the go-ahead to use US long-range missiles to strike inside Russia. Ukraine carried out its first such aerial attack in a border region on Tuesday morning. US bond prices climbed alongside gains for gold (GC=F), and other safe-haven assets as the risk-off trade kicked in. Treasury yields — which move inversely to bond prices — fell, with the 10-year benchmark yield (^TNX) down roughly 4 basis points to around 4.38%. Gold jumped nearly 1% to trade above $2,600 an ounce. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) prices touched a new record of above $93,500 a token.

Lovers of tennis, baseball, and basketball, beware: Your balls, racquets and bats may soon be pricier. Amer Sports (AS) — the parent company of Wilson, Arc’teryx, Salomon, and other sportswear and sports gear brands — said Trump's promised tariffs would prompt the company to raise prices for sports equipment. ""[O]ur Ball & Racquet segment would be most impacted, predominantly tennis rackets, baseball bats, and basketballs,"" said CFO Andrew Page on an earnings call Tuesday. ""We have some degree of flexibility to adjust our supply chain, but price increases will be the primary tool we utilize should tariffs occur."" Wilson makes tennis rackets and basketballs, while Amer Sports' brands Louisville Slugger, DeMarini, EvoShield, and ATEC make baseball equipment. Trump's tariff promises include 10%-20% tariffs across the board and a 60% tariff on goods from China, and retailers have been working to ease investor anxieties over their potential impact. Amer Sports shares rose over 3% on Tuesday after the company surpassed Wall Street's expectations in its third quarter earnings report. Shares had initially fallen in earlier trade. Here are some of the top trending tickers on the Yahoo Finance homepage: C3.ai (AI): Shares surged over 25% on Tuesday after the company announced an expanded strategic alliance with Microsoft (MSFT). The expansion will accelerate enterprise artificial intelligence adoption on Microsoft Azure. Read more here. Bakkt Holdings (BKKT): Bakkt stock extended gains on Tuesday, rising around 3% after a report from the Financial Times on Monday said Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT), which operates the social network Truth Social, is in advanced talks to acquire the crypto exchange. Bakkt shares had surged over 162% in the immediate aftermath of the report. Read more about the potential acquisition here. Super Micro Computer (SMCI): The stock jumped over 30%, its highest level in two weeks, after the artificial intelligence company said Monday it would stay listed on the Nasdaq as the exchange reviews its compliance plan. The company's stock has been battered over the past few months as investors continue to grapple with the fallout from an August report by short seller firm Hindenburg Research. The report alleged accounting malpractices, violations of export controls, and shady relationships between top executives and Super Micro partners. Read more about SMCI here. Trump confirmed Howard Lutnick, chairman and chief executive of investment firm Cantor Fitzgerald, as his pick for commerce secretary. The confirmation follows multiple reports from earlier in the day. The role has been highly anticipated, as whoever is in charge will be responsible for leading the department that will implement the wide-sweeping tariffs Trump has promised. The president-elect has pledged to impose blanket tariffs of at least 10% on all trading partners, including a 60% tariff on Chinese imports. Lutnick has supported Trump's tariff plan, although he's acknowledged the rollout will likely raise prices in the short term. Walmart (WMT) is the latest — and largest — US company warning about the impact new tariffs could have on prices for US consumers. Following its earnings report on Tuesday, the company told Reuters in a statement: ""We're concerned that significantly increased tariffs could lead to increased costs for our customers at a time when they are still feeling the remnants of inflation."" Walmart spokesperson Molly Blakeman reiterated these concerns in a conversation with Yahoo Finance Tuesday afternoon. Blakeman also noted Walmart sources two-thirds of its products domestically and has been navigating higher tariffs for the past seven years — but the levels to which Trump has proposed raising tariffs (10%-20% tariffs across the board and a 60% tariff on goods from China) has caused ""concern."" On Tuesday, Walmart reported third quarter earnings that topped analysts' expectations, sending the retailers' shares up nearly 4% to a record high in afternoon trade. On Monday night, Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin initiated a 2025 year-end S&P 500 target of 6,500, representing about an 11% gain in the benchmark index from current levels. Kostin and others say the market could surge higher even without the ""Magnificent Seven"" tech stocks' massive outperformance. His work shows that the combination of Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) outperformed the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500 by 63 percentage points in 2023 and 22 percentage points thus far this year. In 2024, this was driven by Magnificent Seven earnings outperforming the rest of the index by 30 percentage points. But that margin is projected to fall to just 6 percentage points in 2025, per consensus estimates. This, Kostin believes, will lead to that cohort beating the other 493 stocks by just 7 percentage points in 2025, the narrowest level of outperformance from the Magnificent Seven dating back to 2018. ""The narrowing differential in earnings growth rates should correspond with a narrowing in relative equity returns,"" Kostin wrote. ""Although the 'micro' earnings growth story supports continued ‘Magnificent 7’ outperformance, more 'macro' factors such as economic growth and trade policy lean in favor of the S&P 493.""'

The cryptocurrency has surged since the Presidential election on November 5, touching a record north of $93,400 last week. Bitcoin has been a key component of the 'Trump trade' as President-elect Donald Trump has promised crypto-friendly policies, including the creation of a bitcoin national stockpile. The move higher also comes on the heels of a Financial Time report stating that Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) is in advanced talks to acquire crypto trading company (BKKT), a tie-up which could further encourage initiatives within the sector. Bitcoin proxy stock MicroStrategy (MSTR) touched new record highs on Tuesday. The software company added 52,000 tokens to its portfolio over the past week — its largest purchase of the cryptocurrency yet. Year-to-date MicroStrategy is up 500%. Nvidia (NVDA) stock rose as much as 2.7% on Tuesday following a series of bullish notes from Wall Street analysts ahead of its earnings report set for Wednesday afternoon. The company also saw a boost following news that one of its customers, cloud provider Nebius Group (NBIS), would open operations in the US with GPU clusters that will use 35,000 Nvidia chips. That's about 4% of the volume of Hopper AI chips Wall Street analysts expect Nvidia to have shipped in the October period, Bloomberg data shows. In a client note this week, Stifel analyst Ruben Roy raised his price target on Nvidia to $180 from $165, while Truist Securities' William Stein raised his price outlook to $167 from $148. Roy cited ""a diverse set of data points,"" including continued high spending on AI infrastructure by hyperscalers and demand for Nvidia's latest Blackwell AI chips. ""We believe that NVDA is well positioned in markets that combine to yield an overall TAM of more than $100 billion exiting 2025 and a longer-term opportunity funnel that could approach $1 trillion."" KeyBanc analysts took a more cautious outlook, lowering their outlook for Nvidia for the January quarter, citing a squeeze on demand in China for Nvidia H20 chips. ""We believe H20 demand in China is getting pushed out as there is increased pressure among China hyperscalers to use domestic AI solutions,"" they wrote in a note Tuesday. They also stated fears that Blackwell chips could cannibalize Nvidia's older-generation Hopper chips. ""Regarding H200, we are hearing that some demand is getting pushed out given the availability of Blackwell (B200)."" Donald Trump will reportedly nominate billionaire Howard Lutnick as commerce secretary, according to multiple reports. Lutnik, the co-chair of Trump's transition team, is also chairman and chief executive of investment firm Cantor Fitzgerald. The role has been highly anticipated, as whoever is in charge will be responsible for leading the department that will implement the wide-sweeping tariffs Trump has promised. The president-elect has pledged to impose blanket tariffs of at least 10% on all trading partners, including a 60% tariff on Chinese imports. Lutnik has supported Trump's tariff plan, although he's acknowledged the rollout will likely raise prices in the short term. That's been a concern among economists, who say it's likely the US could face another inflation resurgence if Trump follows through with his key campaign promises. ""We are in the soft landing,"" Nobel Prize-winning economist and Columbia University professor Joseph Stiglitz said at Yahoo Finance's annual Invest conference last week. ""But that ends Jan. 20.""

Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferré reports: Gold futures (GC=F) hovered at a one-week high to trade near $2,630 per ounce on Tuesday as traders assessed the threat of a nuclear escalation in the Russia-Ukraine war. The precious metal extended its gains from Monday as investors flocked to the asset traditionally seen as a safe haven during times of geopolitical uncertainty. On Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a revised nuclear doctrine, which formally lowered the threshold for Russia's use of its nuclear weapons. The move followed a decision by the Biden administration to allow Ukraine's use of long-range US-made missiles to strike deep into Russia. ""Geopolitical risks have reemerged, driving demand for gold and solidifying its role as a reliable hedging asset,"" Ahmad Assiri, research strategist at foreign exchange broker Pepperstone, said in a note on Tuesday. Gold had been on a tear up until the US elections on Nov. 5. It has since fallen as the US dollar (DX-Y.NYB) strengthened. Still, the precious metal is up about 27% year to date, beating the S&P 500's (^GSPC) gain of 23% over the same period as central banks have boosted their gold reserves. Read more here. It was a tale of two retailers this morning. Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports: Walmart (WMT), the world's biggest retailer, posted fiscal third quarter results that easily beat Wall Street expectations as inflation-weary shoppers continue to search for value. The stock popped over 3%. Sales of $169.59 billion topped analyst estimates for $167.5 billion. Adjusted earnings per share eclipsed estimates by $0.05 at $0.58. The company also raised its guidance for fiscal year 2025 for the third time. Read more here. Lowe's (LOW) stock fell nearly 5% shortly after the opening bell as investors homed in on continued negative sales growth despite results that beat the Street's estimates. The home improvement retailer posted revenue of $20.17 billion, compared to estimates of $19.93 billion. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.89, versus the $2.82 expected. Same-store sales fell 1.1%, less than the 2.7% decline anticipated. The company alluded to ongoing softness in the ""DIY bigger-ticker discretionary demand,"" which was offset by hurricane-related recovery efforts following Hurricanes Helene and Milton and positive same-store sales in its Pro business and online. Read more here. Housing starts fell in October, pressured by a drop in single-family construction. Data from the Census Bureau showed housing starts dropped 3.1% in October to an annual rate of 1.311 million units. Meanwhile, single-family housing starts slipped 6.9% to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 970,000 units, unchanged from a year ago. The decline came as mortgage rates have been climbing, with the average 30-year fixed loan hovering around 6.7%. Rates on a home loan tend to follow US Treasury yields, which have been rising since mid-September partly due to investor anticipation of Trump’s victory and his proposed policies around taxes and tariffs. Higher rates also likely discouraged builders from filing building permits during the month. Contract permits for single family dwellings fell to a pace of 968,000, a 0.5% drop from September’s revised figure of 963,000. ""Major storms likely stalled the beginnings of some residential projects, causing a steep decline in construction in the southeast,"" Jeffrey Roach, chief economist at LPL Financial, wrote after the release. ""Both housing starts and building permits declined in October as several homebuilders appeared to hold back the start of projects until after the election. However, more recent surveys showed a rebound in homebuilder confidence."" US stocks fell at the open on Tuesday after President Vladimir Putin signed a revised nuclear doctrine, allowing Russia to expand its use of atomic weapons in a possible escalation of the Russia-Ukraine war. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) led the declines, down about 0.8%. The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) slid roughly 0.5% to fall below its election breakout level, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) also dropped around 0.5% on the heels of a mixed day for the major gauges. Super Micro Computer (SMCI), an AI server maker and Nvidia (NVDA) partner, soared over 25% premarket Tuesday. The sprint higher came after the company on Monday submitted a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission saying that it's supplied a compliance plan with the Nasdaq to avoid delisting. Also boosting the stock, Super Micro said it's hired a new auditor, BDO, after its prior accountant, Ernst & Young, resigned in late October. The company was in hot water with the Nasdaq after delaying both its annual and quarterly filings to the SEC following a scathing report from short-selling firm Hindenburg Research.

Bitcoin prices held steady over the weekend around $91,000 after last week's surge sent prices for the world's largest cryptocurrency above $80,000 and then $90,000 for the first time. Bitcoin has been a key component of the ""Trump trade,"" as President-elect Donald Trump has promised to explore crypto-friendly policies, including the creation of a bitcoin national stockpile. Bitcoin spot ETFs have also seen massive inflows in recent weeks. As Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reported earlier this week, BlackRock’s spot bitcoin ETF (IBIT) saw its assets rise by $13 billion in the wake of Trump's win on Nov. 5, according to Yahoo Finance data. This pushed assets in the iShares Bitcoin Trust past $40 billion just 10 months after its launch. Options tied to IBIT also began trading on the Nasdaq on Tuesday, pushing additional trading activity into the crypto space. The move higher also comes on the heels of a Financial Times report stating that Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) is in advanced talks to acquire crypto trading company Bakkt (BKKT), a tie-up that could further encourage initiatives within the sector. Crypto-related stocks like trading platforms Coinbase (COIN) and Robinhood (HOOD) have also benefited from the recent rally, gaining 65% and 42% over the past 10 days, respectively. Bitcoin proxy MicroStrategy (MSTR) touched new record highs on Tuesday.

140,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-strategists-arent-relying-on-ai-to-drive-the-stock-market-rally-anymore-morning-brief-110048376.html,"Tue, Nov 19, 2024, 3:00 AM"," This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings The early results are in and Wall Street strategists issuing 2025 forecasts see the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rally chugging along over the next 12 months. But missing from their baseline calls is one of the most popular themes of the past 18 months in markets: artificial intelligence. AI driving the market higher has been a hallmark of market calls dating back to the spring of 2023 when Nvidia's first blowout earnings report of the cycle kickstarted a roaring bull market rally. On Monday, BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski initiated a 2025 year-end target of 6,700 for the S&P 500. Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson issued a 12-month target of 6,500. Neither leaned too far into the impact of AI driving stocks higher — perhaps a sign of a maturing bull market — and instead, both discussed further broadening of the rally away from the tech-concentrated stock market of the past two years. ""We expect this broadening in earnings growth to continue as the Fed cuts rates into next year and business cycle indicators continue to improve,"" Wilson wrote. Belski's work shows the market has already broadened, with 276 stocks outperforming the S&P 500 in the second half of 2024 — better than the 10-year average of 238 and above the number seen since the start of 2023. At the surface this can lead to weaker gains for the index, as smaller gains in small companies make for smaller overall gains. Dating back to 1990, Belski found that when the top 100 stocks in the S&P 500 outperform, the index delivers an average annual return of 11.8% compared to the average return of 8% when those stocks underperform the index. In other words, the returns aren't bad; they're just not as great as the ones investors have enjoyed for two years now. To be clear, the idea that an AI-related fever could keep driving stock prices higher hasn't been forgotten among Wall Street strategists. Just two weeks ago, Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel wrote that he sees the S&P 500 reaching 6,600 by June 2025 as ""exuberance lies ahead"" amid a ""public reengaged in speculation."" Wilson did offer a bull case in which wide AI adoption juices margins — and pushes the flagship index near 7,400. For any investor in the S&P 500, that of course sounds like an appealing scenario. But perhaps even more appealing is that strategists no longer need to rely on AI to explain why the market will keep moving higher. Even if AI doesn't show up to the party, Wall Street expects a good time. It's a stark contrast from where things stood in 2023, when AI mentions first started littering S&P 500 target changes across Wall Street and the macro backdrop was much more bleak. Recession fears were still common among economists. The other 493 S&P 500 stocks were still in an earnings recession. And speculation around the Fed centered on how much more they'd hike interest rates, not cut them. While those debates could resurface at any moment, we've made it to the other side of all those rungs on the wall of worry. And for now, Wilson's base case is driven by a backdrop where the broadening of earnings rolls on as the Fed cuts rates and business cycle indicators continue to improve.

But the election of Donald Trump as the nation's next president has complicated the outlook. And some economists now think it's likely the US could face another inflation resurgence if Trump follows through with his key campaign promises. ""We are in the soft landing,"" Nobel prize-winning economist and Columbia University professor Joseph Stiglitz said at Yahoo Finance's annual Invest conference on Tuesday. ""But that ends Jan. 20."" Trump and his proposed policies have been viewed as potentially more inflationary due to the president-elect's campaign promises of high tariffs on imported goods, tax cuts for corporations, and curbs on immigration. Those policies could also pressure an already bloated federal deficit, further complicating the Federal Reserve's path forward for interest rates. ""The biggest risk is a large across-the-board tariff, which would likely hit growth hard,"" Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in a note to clients on Thursday. Jennifer McKeown, chief global economist at Capital Economics, also acknowledged in a note this week there are ""upside risks"" to inflation ""stemming partly from Trump’s proposed tariff and immigration policies."" And investors have taken notice. On Wednesday, the latest Global Fund Manager Survey from Bank of America highlighted increased expectations of a ""no landing"" scenario, in which the economy continues to grow but inflation pressures persist, leading to a higher-for-longer interest rate policy from the central bank. Tariffs have been one of the most talked-about promises of Trump's campaign. The president-elect has pledged to impose blanket tariffs of at least 10% on all trading partners, including a 60% tariff on Chinese imports. ""It will be inflationary,"" Stiglitz said. ""And then you start thinking of the inflationary spiral. The prices go up. Workers will want more wages. And then you start thinking of what happens if others retaliate [with their own duties.]"" Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari categorized a possible retaliation as a ""tit-for-tat"" trade war, which would keep inflation elevated over the long term. ""If inflation goes up, [Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell] is going to raise interest rates,"" Stiglitz said. ""You combine the higher interest rates and the retaliation from other countries, you're going to get a global slowdown. Then you have the worst of all possible worlds: inflation and stagnation, or slow growth."" Investors have dialed back rate cut expectations in preparation. Since the Fed's first rate cut on Sept. 18, markets now expect three fewer rate cuts between now and the end of next year, per the CME's FedWatch Tool. But the US economy has remained resilient in the face of high interest rates. Retail sales once again topped estimates for the month of October, GDP remains strong, the unemployment rate continues to hover at around 4%, and inflation has moderated despite its bumpy path down to 2%. Additionally, it remains unclear which policies will be a priority once Trump takes office or if he'll fully commit to the promises he's already made. The only certainty is change. In 2025, the GOP has not only secured the White House but also maintained control of the House of Representatives and flipped the Senate. ""The Republican sweep in the elections is likely to bring sweeping policy changes,"" Bank of America's US economics team wrote in a client note on Friday. ""There are plausible scenarios in which growth could run above 3%, or the economy could enter a recession,"" the team said. ""Our base case is sanguine, but our conviction is low.

Nvidia (NVDA) mania is heating up ahead of the market darling's Wednesday earnings report. The company is “representative of the most important stocks in America,” EMJ Capital founder and president Eric Jackson told Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (listen in below; video above). Jackson reiterated his call that Nvidia's stock could double within the next twelve months given its wide lead on AI chip production. “The investments [in AI] are just getting started,” Jackson added. “The need for these chips is still going to continue for the next year or two or three.” Nvidia's stock has surged more than 2,600% in the past five years according to Yahoo Finance data, fueled by one impressive quarter after another as it grabbed the top position in cutting-edge chips. The company's strong performance are expected to continue in its fiscal third quarter — sales and profits are each estimated to be up 83% from a year ago. Wall Street remains bullish on its favorite stock. Of the 63 sell-side analysts that cover Nvidia, 59 rate the stock a buy or strong buy, Yahoo Finance data shows. The average price target stands at $160.38, about 13% above current levels. ""We see the near-term risks as largely balanced and we are buyers of Nvidia heading into its fiscal third quarter earnings report scheduled for Wednesday. Positive set-up indicators from accelerating bookings at cloud service providers, an upward bias on hyper-scale capital expenditures, as well as our view that near-term estimates will increase post the earnings call,"" Evercore ISI analyst Mark Lipacis said in a client note on Monday. Lipacis says if Nvidia were to let investors down, it would come in the form of decelerating revenue growth. There has been a whirlwind of activity around Nvidia as of late. In addition to achieving world's most valuable company status by nudging out Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG), Nvidia joined the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Nov. 8. Former chip leader Intel (INTC) was kicked out. “It’s good that Nvidia is part of the mix now,” Jackson said, noting it could encourage purchases from retail investors. One potential hiccup is the restrictions around selling to China by the Biden administration and subsequent write downs which were a “meaningful part of their quarterly earnings,” Jackson said. “They had to take it down to zero.” Incoming president Donald Trump could stay firm on the chip issue as well, making good on his campaign promises around China. ""The good news for investors is that they’ve written everything down and so if anything comes from the relationship with China and Nvidia, it’s going to be great,” Jackson said. Wall Street will be hard pressed to downgrade Nvidia's stock in the medium-term. “The revenue monetization opportunity is so much greater [than investors appreciate],” Bank of America analyst and Nvidia bull Vivek Arya told Sozzi on Opening Bid. Key drivers for Arya's bullish Nvidia call include coming next-generation AI chips — Blackwell Ultra, Rubin, and Rubin Ultra. Those offerings will begin hitting the market in the third quarter of 2025 based on Arya's analysis. Grace L. Williams is a writer for Yahoo Finance.

143,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-stock-recovers-from-losses-after-technical-glitches-disrupt-the-jake-paul-mike-tyson-boxing-match-165922126.html,"Mon, Nov 18, 2024, 12:27 PM"," Netflix (NFLX) shares recovered from earlier losses on Monday after the streaming giant's highly anticipated boxing event between heavyweight champion Mike Tyson and YouTube personality Jake Paul experienced technical glitches throughout the live broadcast. The issues have sparked concerns about the company's ability to deliver other types of live programs, especially with the upcoming NFL Christmas Day games in just over a month. Customers complained about buffering disruptions and streaming issues while watching the event Friday night. Downdetector, which tracks internet outages, received thousands of outage reports throughout the evening. Netflix declined to directly comment on the glitches when asked by Yahoo Finance. Since the start of the year, Netflix shares have surged over 70%, far outpacing the broader markets and streaming rivals, including Disney (DIS) and Comcast (CMCSA). Shares climbed more than 2% in afternoon trade on Monday. Bandwidth issues were likely at fault: The company revealed 60 million households around the world tuned in to watch. It alluded to the technical problems in an Instagram post, saying the event ""even had our buffering systems on the ropes."" But it's not the first time Netflix has faced technical glitches from its various live events, which have included comedy specials and reunion tapings. That's led to investor concerns the company won't be able to get things right in time for its NFL Christmas Day doubleheader, with the Kansas City Chiefs vs. Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens vs. Houston Texans. Multiple users on social media platforms vented their frustrations, explicitly calling out the streaming issues and disruptions throughout the night. Still, Oppenheimer analyst Jason Helfstein shrugged off the customer complaints, writing in a note to clients on Sunday that viewing was likely twice as large as the company's internal expectations, ""a high quality problem than can be easily fixed by Christmas Day."" Netflix inked a three-season deal with the NFL earlier this year to air the Christmas Day games, which will be produced by CBS Sports (PARA). The streamer reportedly coughed up about $75 million per game, according to the Wall Street Journal. Late Sunday, the company announced Beyoncé as the headline performer during the Ravens vs. Texans halftime show. It will be the first time the artist will perform her Grammy-nominated album ""Cowboy Cater"" live. Assuming 2.5 viewers per household, Helfstein estimated about 150 million global viewers tuned in to watch the Tyson-Paul event. That's greater than the 124 million US viewers who watched the 2024 Super Bowl, the highest viewership for any US broadcast. The analyst, who has an Outperform rating on shares, called out Netflix's ability to generate massive viewership, ""suggesting the company will be successful with advertising around live events."" Last week, Netflix said its ad tier, now two years old, has reached 70 million global monthly active users, a significant jump from the 40 million users the company revealed at its second Upfront presentation in May. Of note: Monthly active users, otherwise known as MAUs, are not the same as paying subscribers. The company has yet to reveal actual subscriber figures for the ad tier or how much revenue it's generated so far. MAUs can include multiple people using the same account. Netflix recently beat Wall Street expectations across every major financial metric in its third quarter results on Oct. 17, with shares surging to all-time highs as many analysts call Netflix the winner of the hard-fought streaming wars. Still, the company recently revealed that year-over-year engagement levels came in roughly flat — a potential headwind when it comes to the company's ability to raise prices and boost growth. ""With much of the subscriber growth seemingly representing improved monetization of an existing (and not growing) user base, we question whether the momentum can continue into next year,"" MoffettNathanson analyst Robert Fishman wrote in a recent note to clients. Valuation has also been a concern, with Fishman adding that Netflix's stock ""is massively expensive for a company whose own guidance implies a revenue deceleration into 2025."" Last month, Netflix said its revenue growth is expected to slow from an expected 15% this year to between 11% and 13% in 2025. Alexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

144,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-could-be-the-next-biden-210950477.html,"Tue, Nov 19, 2024, 1:09 PM"," Democrats are deservedly disheartened at the drubbing voters administered in the 2024 elections. Americans didn’t just restore Donald Trump to the White House, they also gave Republicans control of both houses of Congress and exiled the Democratic Party to the political wilderness. Trumpism rules, it seems. But there could be another trend at work that will boomerang back on to Trump, eventually: Americans may be chronically gloomy about stagnating living standards and bound to take it out on whoever is in charge. For three elections in a row, voters have bounced the incumbent party from the White House. Trump upset Hillary Clinton in 2016 in what was partly a vote against the slow-growing Barack Obama economy. Joe Biden beat Trump in 2020 amid widespread dissatisfaction with Trump’s handling of the COVID pandemic. The 2024 election was a referendum on the policies of Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who replaced Biden atop the Democratic ticket in August. The outcome: thumbs down, especially on economic issues. The incumbent party normally has a decisive advantage in presidential elections, whether the president is running for another term or passing the torch to a successor. Unless there's a recession, the incumbent party typically wins. Yet there was no recession in 2016, when voters replaced the incumbent Democrat with a Republican. There was a short recession in 2020, but it ended seven months before Election Day, when voters ejected Trump. And despite high inflation, there’s been no recession under Biden. The power of incumbency simply isn’t what it used to be. Inflation was clearly ruinous for Biden and Harris, but so was their inability to fix intractable problems that go back decades. In a recent Harvard CAPS/Harris poll, the economy ranked as the top issue for 2024 voters and 58% rated the economy as “weak.” Of people who cast a ballot, 76% said they voted for change. Trump was the change candidate because he’s been on the sidelines for the past four years — and there were no other choices. So will Trump bring the change Americans want? On some issues — notably immigration — he could, because the president has the authority to set policy in a way that will make a difference. But there’s a good chance many of the problems vexing voters in 2024 will be just as nettlesome in 2028, when Trump will be the incumbent promoting his own vice president, JD Vance, as the future of Trumpism. Drop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter. America has become a wrong-track country. For the last 20 years, more than half of all Americans have been unhappy with the direction of the country, according to Gallup. There was an uptick in satisfaction under Trump, but that crashed amid COVID. The broader trend is stark: Not once during the last 20 years has satisfaction approached the peaks of the 1990s, when Bill Clinton was president, or the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan served two terms. The most likely explanation for this national gloom is worsening wealth and income inequality, with well-educated workers in dynamic areas getting ahead and undereducated workers in stagnant parts of the country falling behind. Wealth for college graduates has grown by 356% since 2000, according to Federal Reserve data. Wealth for Americans with just a high school degree has grown by just 100% during the same time frame. The portion of wealth held by college grads has grown from 60% to 74% since 2000. For high-school grads, it has dropped from 17% to 9%. There’s nothing wrong with well-educated people in the right places getting wealthier. But there’s a lot wrong with lesser-educated people who make up the majority of the US population getting poorer. Trump appeals to that demographic when he rails against companies shipping jobs overseas and migrants working for less pay than Americans might. In the 2024 election, 43% of voters had a college degree, while 57% did not. Less-educated Americans are decisive in national elections. They’re the ones demanding change, in the form of paychecks that stretch further and improving living standards. But there’s no simple cure for a tech-based service economy that has left millions of workers behind. Trump’s plan to slap new tariffs on imports and deport millions of undocumented migrants won’t do anything to restore the sort of high-paying manufacturing jobs millions of Americans relied on 50 years ago. Automation, artificial intelligence, and agile supply chains provide the efficiency big companies crave. They don’t want to hire more Americans to do manual labor for higher pay, and Trump can’t browbeat them into doing so. Some cities and states have programs to match employers with local schools that train the types of workers they need, which helps young people develop the skills that will help them get ahead. Trump hasn’t proposed anything like that. Instead, he falls back on lazy, supply-side orthodoxy: Cut taxes and regulations and turn businesses loose to grow and prosper. Developments of the last 40 years show that this enriches the shareholder class, with little trickling down to workers. If anything, Trump could put upward pressure on prices, just as inflation seems to be abating, by deporting migrants who work on farms and at processing plants and making imported products more expensive through higher tariffs. Trump hasn’t proposed anything to lower housing costs, and interest rates are already drifting upward in anticipation of slightly higher inflation and a lot more deficit spending under Trump. If that happens, rent and groceries could take a bigger bite out of the typical paycheck four years from now. Biden’s record as president holds cautionary notes for Trump and other future presidents. Biden actually got measurable results that ought to boost blue-collar fortunes. He signed laws funding infrastructure buildout, semiconductor manufacturing, and green energy investment, which will subsidize employment in those fields years into the future. Some provisions of those laws require employers getting subsidies to hire unionized workers. The economy, meanwhile, has added 685,000 manufacturing jobs since Biden took office, twice the number under Trump before COVID hit and unemployment soared. None of that impressed voters in 2024, and Trump could have just as much difficulty moving the needle during the next four years. And in 2028, the Trumpist candidate will be the incumbent trying to sell voters on more of the same. Rick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance. Follow him on Twitter at @rickjnewman.

On Tuesday, the world's biggest retailer posted fiscal third quarter results that easily beat Wall Street expectations. Sales of $169.59 billion topped analyst estimates for $167.5 billion. Adjusted earnings per share eclipsed estimates by $0.05 at $0.58. ""We had a really strong quarter,"" Walmart CFO John David Rainey told Yahoo Finance, noting that e-commerce now makes up 18% of the business overall as consumers lean into convenience via delivery and pickup. Walmart stock rose over 4% in early trading on Tuesday. The stock is up 65% year to date, outperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Average's (^DJI) 14% advance. Here's what Walmart posted for its third quarter of fiscal year 2025 results, compared to Bloomberg consensus estimates: Revenue: $169.59 billion versus $167.5 billion Adjusted earnings per share: $0.58 versus $0.53 Overall same-store sales growth: 5.5% versus 3.81% Walmart US same-store sales growth: 5.3% versus 3.68% Foot traffic growth: 3.1% versus 2.82% Ticket growth: 2.1% versus 1.2% E-commerce sales growth: 22% versus 2.22% Sam's Club US same-store sales growth: 7% versus 4.22% Walmart US same-store sales jumped 5.3%, driven by an increase in foot traffic, up 3.1%, and a higher average ticket, up 2.1%.

The home improvement retailer posted revenue of $20.17 billion, compared to estimates of $19.93 billion. Adjusted earnings per share came in at $2.89, versus the $2.82 expected. ""Our results this quarter were modestly better-than-expected, even excluding storm-related activity, driven by high-single-digit positive comps in Pro, strong online sales and smaller-ticket outdoor DIY projects,"" Lowe's CEO Marvin Ellison wrote in the earnings release. Same-store sales growth was down 1.1%, less than the 2.7% decline anticipated. Continuing softness from DIY shoppers was partially offset by hurricane-related recovery efforts following Hurricanes Helene and Milton and positive same-store sales in its Pro business and online. ""Consumers continue to face affordability challenges as both inflation and interest rates are putting pressure on their [wallets]. Mortgage rates also remained stubbornly high,"" Ellison said on Lowe's earnings call. The 30-year fixed rate mortgage edged higher again this week, hitting 6.61%.

""It's unclear when lower rates and improved consumer sentiment will translate into improved home improvement demand.""

The company — which partners with Nvidia (NVDA) to provide high-tech servers with its AI chips and recently scored a major deal to supply those servers to Elon Musk's xAI — said its compliance plan shows it is on track to submit delayed filings to the SEC ""and become current with its periodic reports within the discretionary period available to the Nasdaq staff to grant."" Investors eagerly awaited the filing following a Barron’s report on Friday after the bell, which stated that Super Micro would submit its plan to prevent delisting by the deadline on Monday per Nasdaq rules, citing people familiar with the matter. The stock surged roughly 16% during regular trading Monday. The server maker also said Monday that the company has hired a new auditor, BDO, after its prior accountant, EY, resigned in late October. Even with this week's surge, shares have tumbled roughly 56% over the past three months. After gaining as much as 300% earlier this year, SMCI stock is now down over 20% in 2024. Super Micro has been grappling with the fallout from an August report by short seller firm Hindenburg Research, which shed light on alleged accounting malpractices, violations of export controls, and shady relationships between top executives and Super Micro partners. Following the Hindenburg report, the company delayed its annual 10-K filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission. And last week, Super Micro also delayed filing its most recent quarterly 10-Q report to the SEC. Adding to its woes, the company is reportedly being investigated by the Department of Justice. The barrage of bad news sent shares tumbling — EY’s resignation, in particular, pushed Super Micro stock down more than 30% in a single day in late October. Shares of the company also fell sharply following Super Micro’s fiscal first quarter earnings report on Nov. 5, which missed Wall Street’s expectations, sending shares down 18% on the day following the results. Super Micro rose to prominence over the past year as the generative artificial intelligence boom propelled sales for its AI servers and other AI-related tech. In its fiscal year 2024, Super Micro’s adjusted earnings rose nearly 90% to $2.21 per share, and revenue soared 110% to $15 billion. Analysts expect the company’s earnings to grow more than 40% in the 2025 fiscal year, and they see sales surging just over 70%. Elsewhere on Monday, the server maker announced product updates during the Supercomputing Conference in Atlanta, including its next-generation AI servers using Nvidia Blackwell chips. ""Supermicro has the expertise, delivery speed, and capacity to deploy the largest liquid-cooled AI data center projects in the world, containing 100,000 GPUs, which Supermicro and NVIDIA contributed to and recently deployed,"" Super Micro CEO Charles Liang wrote in a statement on Monday.

148,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/starbucks-ceo-aims-to-improve-employee-relationship-after-years-of-struggles-152037319.html,"Mon, Nov 18, 2024, 7:20 AM"," Starbucks (SBUX) is trying to brew up a new chapter with its baristas as the coffee giant attempts a wider turnaround in its business and stock price under new CEO Brian Niccol. It has been nearly three years — and four CEOs — since the union labor movement rocked the business and a Starbucks in Buffalo won its vote to unionize, a first for the company. As of early November, there are 515 stores represented by Workers United out of nearly 17,000 US locations. Once a leader in worker benefits, Starbucks was accused of ""short staffing and unpredictable scheduling; low wages; unaffordable healthcare; harassment; broken equipment; unfair discipline"" by Workers United. Starbucks' problems have been taking a toll. Its limited-time offerings didn't succeed, and its value perception weakened. US and North American same-store sales dropped 6% in its latest quarter, while adjusted earnings per share plunged 24%. Year to date, the stock is up only 3%, compared to 23% for the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Starbucks shares trade on a trailing 12-month price-to-sales ratio of 3 times, below that of fellow coffee purveyors McDonald's (MCD), at 8 times, and Dutch Bros (BROS), at 3.7 times, according to Yahoo Finance's stock comparison tool. At Niccol's former employer, Chipotle (CMG), which is seen as more employee-friendly, shares are up 31% this year. BTIG analyst Peter Saleh said investors are focused on Starbucks solidifying solutions to free up baristas, improve a hectic environment, and get the equipment needed to efficiently execute a complex menu. ""So long as their wages are competitive, ... their benefits are in line, much better than the industry ... and they provide some of the things that Brian's already doing, which is trying to make [a barista's] life a little bit easier,"" Saleh told Yahoo Finance. Niccol said the team has made progress toward alleviating key complaints from workers. The former Taco Bell chief is adding staff at 3,000 stores to see if it helps during the morning rush while finding the ""right algorithm"" to support mobile and drive-through orders. Store crews want to ""get back to making great coffee, make it easy for our customers to get coffee, [and] make it easy for us to move the products between mobile order and in-cafe,"" Niccol exclusively told Yahoo Finance (video above) about the feedback he got when visiting cafes after joining the coffee chain in September. He's also prioritizing the Siren Craft System, a series of equipment and process improvements introduced under ousted CEO Laxman Narasimhan in September 2022. Narasimhan had planned for 10% of US locations to have the full suite by the end of 2024. The system is intended to improve employees' working experience and customer wait times, but Narasimhan didn't ""double down and roll it out,"" Saleh said. As sales fell, Wall Street grew impatient. ""The Siren system, which has been put on the back burner by Laxman, is now being put on the front burner ... by Brian,"" Saleh said. Starbucks baristas have long complained about increasingly complex drink menus clogging up the process and leaving customers waiting. On Starbucks' latest earnings call, Niccol said, ""Part of the reason why I think we've zigged and zagged on that Siren Craft System is because we didn't have clarity on what problem we were trying to solve."" He identified bottlenecks including warming food in the oven, making cold beverages, and fulfilling digital orders through four channels — in-cafe, mobile order and pay, drive-through, and delivery. If a ""store requires a full Siren Craft System, put it in. If it requires some pieces of it, put that in. If it just requires staffing and better deployment, we'll implement that,"" he said of his approach. Niccol also told Yahoo Finance he's working to improve the career roadmap for employees, though no details were shared. ""It's important to get to this 90% promote within,"" Niccol said. He made a similar move at Chipotle. Starbucks plans to have 55,000 locations worldwide by 2030, so solving worker issues is mission-critical. Today, there are 40,199 stores in operation. Investing in employees is crucial to boosting financial results experts say, along with improving in-store experience and service speed. Niccol had set a goal of fulfilling each drink order in four minutes or less. ""Restaurants with the least amount of turnover ... from the manager on down to the hourly employees, perform the best in terms of same-store sales growth,"" Saleh said. ""When you have less turnover, there's less investment or spend on training ... your margins tend to improve."" Meanwhile, unionization talks have gone on behind closed doors after the two parties agreed on a path forward in February. ""We continue to make significant progress at the bargaining table where we are addressing issues like staffing, pay,"" bargaining delegate and 14-year barista Michelle Eisen told Yahoo Finance. Baristas' voices are ""critical"" to Starbucks’ success in rebuilding, she noted. When asked about Niccol, Eisen said it's ""great"" that Starbucks is ""investing in leadership,"" but she added that ""now they need to invest in workers all the way down."" When Yahoo Finance asked Niccol about his thoughts on unionization efforts in recent years, he avoided answering the subject. — Brooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

149,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ibm-ceo-on-trump-less-regulation-more-innovation-is-a-win-for-business-163041839.html,"Sun, Nov 17, 2024, 9:33 AM"," Tech executives may be warming to Donald Trump’s return to the White House as his quick win sparks optimism for more spending and dealmaking. “Business does a lot better when uncertainty goes away,” IBM (IBM) CEO Arvind Krishna told me at Yahoo Finance’s Invest conference. “We are hopeful that there is going to be a lot more innovation and less regulation. Those are both good for businesses across the board.” Krishna believes a lighter regulatory environment will prompt clients to make investment decisions more quickly and also lay the groundwork for a more favorable deal environment. “If we have more certainty on the outcome, then we are willing to lean into things like M&A … If the regulatory process and antitrust are going to be more certain, that allows you to take more risk,” Krishna added. A shift toward less regulation would be a dramatic change for the industry, which has faced intense scrutiny from the Biden administration. Under FTC Chair Lina Khan’s leadership, regulators aggressively pursued cases against the industry’s biggest companies, including Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL). Trump, on the other hand, has promised to cut excess red tape, including his promise to throw out Biden’s executive order aimed at putting safety guardrails on AI — a move that would be viewed as controversial by those within the industry. While Trump’s antitrust agendas remain uncertain, there seems to be growing optimism that he'll employ a more hands-off approach compared to Biden. “We expect tech stocks to rally further into year-end as the Street further digests a less regulatory spider web under Trump with Khan/FTC days in the rear view mirror, stronger AI initiatives within the Beltway on the way, and a goldilocks foundation for Big Tech and Tesla looking into 2025 and beyond,” Wedbush’s Dan Ives wrote in a recent note to clients. Cisco (CSCO) CFO Scott Herren is confident in the company’s momentum heading into 2025.

Trump’s antitrust agendas uncertain, growing optimism that he'll employ a more hands-off approach compared Biden. “We expect tech stocks to rally further into year-end as the Street further digests a less regulatory spider web under Trump with Khan/FTC days in the rear view mirror, stronger AI initiatives within the the way, and goldilocks foundation for Big Tech and Tesla looking into 2025 and beyond,” Wedbush’s Dan Ives wrote in recent note to clients.

150,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-rally-stumbles-with-nvidia-earnings-on-tap-what-to-know-this-week-123851710.html,"Mon, Nov 18, 2024, 3:01 AM"," The feverish post-election stock market rally came to a screeching halt last week. For the week, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) fell more than 2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) shed more than 500 points or nearly 1.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) sank over 3%. Two firm inflation readings and commentary from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell weighed on markets last week, with growing uncertainty over the Fed's rate path outweighing previous investor excitement over Trump's potential policy agenda. In the week ahead, a few economic data releases are expected to add to that narrative, with activity in the services and manufacturing sector and a consumer sentiment reading headlining the schedule. Earnings, however, will bring attention back to some of the biggest names in the corporate world after a few weeks of macro and political events dominating investor mindshare. Key among these reports will be earnings from AI leader Nvidia (NVDA), which is set to report results after the bell on Wednesday. Quarterly results from Walmart (WMT), Target (TGT), BJ's (BJ), and Deere & Company (DE) will also be in focus. Since the Federal Reserve slashed its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point on Sept. 18, bond yields have ripped higher. The 10-year Treasury (^TNX) yield rose by 80 basis points between that date and the days following the election to trade near 4.5%. That move in rates hadn't been an issue for the stock market rally until last week. While strategists have pointed out that a move higher in rates supported by stronger-than-expected economic growth could be welcome news for stocks, recent inflation data has thrown a wrench in that thesis. On Wednesday, the ""core"" Consumer Price Index (CPI), which strips out the more volatile costs of food and gas, showed prices increased 3.3% annually for the third consecutive month during October. On Thursday, the ""core"" Producer Price Index (PPI) revealed prices increased by 3.1% over last year in October, up from 2.8% the month prior and above economist expectations for a 3% increase. Later on Thursday, Powell said in a speech the Fed doesn't need to be ""in a hurry"" to lower interest rates given the strength of the US economy. Markets moved lower on the comments, and the selling continued on Friday, with the Nasdaq Composite sliding more than 2.2% for the session. ""Slower progress on inflation in recent months may prompt the Fed to reevaluate its pace of easing moving forward,"" Wells Fargo's economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a weekly note to clients on Friday. As of Friday afternoon, investors were pricing in a 58% chance the Fed cuts interest rates by 25 basis points at its December meeting, down from the nearly 86% chance seen a month ago, per the CME FedWatch Tool. Schwab Asset Management CEO and chief investment officer Omar Aguilar told Yahoo Finance Powell's comments and the Fed debate add uncertainty and ""additional volatility and, therefore, the opportunity for investors to take something off the table and take some profits."" Amid all the macro headlines influencing the stock market in November, S&P 500 companies have posted solid third quarter earnings. The S&P 500 has grown earnings by 5.4% compared to the same quarter a year prior, marking the fifth straight quarter of earnings growth, per FactSet data. And one of the index's largest contributors to that expected growth is slated to report earnings this week. Nvidia is expected to report earnings per share of $0.74 on revenue of $33.21 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus data. Both metrics would represent more than 80% growth compared to the same period a year prior. ""We expect a similar story to the last several quarters with a beat and raise in the $2B range [for current quarter revenue guidance],"" Jefferies analyst Blayne Curtis wrote in a research note previewing the release. Curtis noted that expectations have continued to ""creep higher"" as Nvidia shares have rallied more than 7% in the past month and are up more than 180% this year. But Curtis believes the stock ""continues to work"" as Nvidia continues with the release of its latest AI chip, Blackwell. Given Nvidia's large weighting in the S&P 500, its earnings for the past couple of quarters have been viewed as a key catalyst for the market's overall direction. And while investors will be listening for any clues about which Big Tech companies continue to spend with the AI chip leader, the actual price action of Nvidia's stock after earnings hasn't been a barometer for broader market performance in the near term. For example, Nvidia's (NVDA) August earnings release did little to impress investors and the stock fell about 6% the day after its earnings release. But that sour sentiment didn't permeate through the market as the S&P 500 closed flat on that same day. This marked the second straight quarter that the broader S&P 500 didn't move with Nvidia following its earnings release. Some of the biggest winners in the market since Donald Trump won the presidential election on Nov. 5 have reversed course. The Nasdaq 100 (^NDX) has given back nearly all of its gains. The S&P 500 closed Friday below where it opened the day after the election. And the small-cap Russell 2000 (^RUT) index, which soared more than 9% following Trump's victory, has now given back about half of those gains. For small caps, the story isn't much different than a week ago, when we noted Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz's concern about earnings momentum for companies in the index. ""In the last 20 days ... we've definitely seen small cap estimates at the margin move pretty sharply lower,"" Kantrowitz said. He added that investors would want to see earnings accelerating to signal the start of a recovery. ""[It's] not something we're seeing quite yet,"" Kantrowitz said. ""So something we'll be monitoring."" The move in small caps is emblematic of the uneven trading action in the two weeks following the election, as any impact from the Trump administration's policies largely remains to be seen. ""Key economic positions have not been announced, and we remain in a policy uncertainty backdrop,"" Citi US equity strategist Scott Chronert wrote in a note to clients when explaining the recent drawdown in the market rally. ""We are working from euphoric sentiment levels and implicit growth expectations at post-2008 highs,"" he added. ""Overall, there is a lot of pressure on macros and fundamentals to deliver, which may explain some recent profit taking after a rapid post-election run.""

151,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/can-donald-trump-save-tiktok-the-clock-is-ticking-160046831.html,"Sat, Nov 16, 2024, 8:00 AM"," Congress and President Joe Biden agreed months ago to outlaw TikTok from operating in the US under Chinese ownership. Donald Trump’s reelection could throw a potential wrench into that plan. Trump’s statements on the campaign trail suggest he may at least try to tinker with the impact of a law signed by Biden in April that makes Chinese ownership of the app illegal. The law, called the Protecting Americans from Foreign Adversary Controlled Applications Act (PAFACAA), gives TikTok’s Chinese owner, ByteDance, an ultimatum to either sell TikTok to a US owner or have it banned from operations in the country. Biden set Jan. 19, a day before Trump is scheduled to be sworn into office, as a deadline for the required divestment — unless the company is able to overturn the law in a court case currently playing out in Washington, D.C. Once back in office, President-elect Trump could ask Congress to undo the law. His chances to do so, if he chooses, may have improved this past week after it was confirmed that Republicans secured enough votes to control both chambers of Congress. In September, the president-elect suggested in a post to his social media website, Truth Social, that he would ""save TikTok"" and prevent federal law enforcement from shuttering the app. ""We’re not doing anything with TikTok, but the other side is going to close it up, so if you like TikTok, go out and vote for Trump,"" the former president said in the post. One political complication for Trump is that he spent his time in office and on the campaign trail promising to protect Americans and US industry against Chinese espionage and other economic threats. But Trump-Vance transition team spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, when asked about TikTok, indicated that the president-elect would follow through on what he pledged. She told Yahoo Finance that “the American people reelected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail. He will deliver.” ByteDance isn’t necessarily waiting on a new Trump administration to save TikTok. It has asked the District of Columbia’s US Court of Appeals to evaluate the constitutionality of the law. The appeals court heard arguments from both sides on Sept. 16, and lawyers for the Justice Department asked the judges to issue their ruling by Dec. 6. The court could issue a decision either before or after Trump’s inauguration. The losing side could also appeal the result to the Supreme Court, which has a conservative majority. ByteDance’s argument to the appeals court is that the law ran afoul of the First Amendment’s free speech protections, the Fifth Amendment’s takings clause, and protections against bills of attainder — also known as ex post facto laws that deem previously legal activity as illegal and then reach back in time to punish violators for past actions. The Justice Department, on the other hand, argues that compelling US national security interests justify restricting a foreign adversary from owning, directing, and controlling a platform like TikTok, including operation of the app's recommendation algorithms and editorial decisions. Fifty-five members of Congress have also urged the D.C. appeals court to uphold the law, emphasizing that Congress chose to enact it after identifying specific threats from China. FBI Director Christopher Wray has testified to the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing that TikTok ""screams"" of US security concerns because government authorities can demand that TikTok hand over user data.

152,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billionaire-tom-steyer-trump-presidency-wont-hold-back-the-energy-transition-173029593.html,"Sun, Nov 17, 2024, 9:50 AM"," Billionaire Tom Steyer cares about politics. He ran for president in 2020 on a climate-friendly agenda, which was followed by his opponents in the Democratic primary solidifying their climate proposals. Since then, he’s founded Galvanize Climate Solutions, an investment firm focused on climate impact, which former Secretary of State John Kerry recently joined as co-executive chair. Given that context, you’d think Steyer would be nervous about the next four years with the election of Donald Trump, who is likely to exit the Paris Climate Agreement again. But in an interview at Yahoo Finance's Invest conference, Steyer stated, “To a very large extent, it doesn't matter” who is in the White House. As he sees it, climate solutions will win in the free market. Steyer pointed to the energy transition that’s already taking place in “deep red states” across the country. Texas, for instance, is the biggest wind energy producer in the United States despite state legislation that excludes wind projects from tax breaks and favors fossil fuels. ""Why are they doing that? Because of the money,"" Steyer said. ""This is business. This is economics. Nobody gets to get away from the rules of markets and prices."" Steyer's comments mirror Apollo (APO) CEO Marc Rowan’s view that the US needs to get on board with the energy transition or it risks getting left behind, which is part of why Rowan is “incredibly optimistic” about four more years under Trump. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management.) ""Those countries that build power, that support data, that support advanced data, advanced AI, advanced power are going to win,"" Rowan said. ""Those that don't are going to be left behind. This is going to be table stakes.” Innovation fueling change in government is part of the thesis behind Steyer’s latest book, ""Cheaper, Faster, Better."" In the book, the billionaire argues that consumer demand for climate-related innovations, which are often cheaper as well, will drive adoption. One example is electric vehicles. Kelley Blue Book reported that EVs now make up about 9% of the car market in the US, nearing a critical 10% adoption threshold. The falling cost of EV ownership has contributed to this trend. Since this data came out, however, the incoming Trump administration announced it plans to roll back EV tax credits from the Inflation Reduction Act, which could reverse this trend. For investors who want high impact and high returns, Steyer said to stick with the fundamentals. “People think that the breakthroughs in the technologies are going be gadgets ... electric vehicles, batteries, things you can touch,"" Steyer said. ""I think there's going be a whole other part of this economy absolutely relevant to climate where returns are going to be really good."" Some areas of investment Steyer is bullish on include real estate, credit, carbon sequestration, and agriculture. Steyer's firm has a real estate fund that focuses on optimizing properties for energy efficiency savings to increase the underlying property value, which fits Steyer’s interest in investments that can solve problems in the next decade rather than over the long term. One such solution that’s getting a lot of attention and investment in the tech world is nuclear energy, with Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Google (GOOG) all pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the space. But Steyer doesn’t see a bull case there yet. “Just being part of the energy transition doesn't necessarily mean that it's a good investment,” he said, adding, “You’d have to be awfully aggressive” to see nuclear fusion energy scale in the next decade. Even nuclear fission, the form of nuclear energy deployed in power plants today, has risks that should be evaluated closely. The success of longer-term bets like nuclear energy may depend on investments from Big Tech, which has been willing to take on riskier investments, since the future of its business depends on energy usage. “Microsoft is definitely really serious about their responsibilities in terms of emissions and climate,"" Steyer said. ""So they're willing to go and try something that's difficult to do and maybe controversial to do.” Regardless of which climate solution wins or who sits in the Oval Office, Steyer believes the momentum toward solving the climate crisis is clear. “In my mind, from the standpoint as an American, I would like to see us continue to be a world leader, both from a business standpoint, an economic standpoint, and also a value standpoint,” he said.

153,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-ceo-guiding-for-some-conservatism-as-the-retailer-misses-earnings-estimates-ahead-of-the-holidays-113031004.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 7:04 AM"," A few months after suggesting a sales turnaround is afoot, Target (TGT) has offered up an earnings day misfire from start to finish. On Wednesday, the retail giant badly missed third quarter Wall Street profit forecasts, slashed full-year guidance after raising it the previous quarter, and took a cautious stance on holiday sales and profit. Target stock sank 21% in early market trading on the heels of the release of its quarterly results. By contrast, its rival Walmart (WMT) beat expectations again — significantly — in quarterly same-store sales performance, online sales growth, and overall narrative to investors, in its own report on Tuesday. Target has been slashing prices on food and other everyday essentials this year in a bid to compete.

154,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/there-are-no-natural-sellers-in-stocks-blackrocks-rick-rieder-140947430.html,"Mon, Nov 18, 2024, 6:09 AM"," Stocks stalled out last week following their post-election pop, but strategists, including Rick Rieder of BlackRock and John Stoltzfus of Oppenheimer, are still longer-term bulls. “There are no natural sellers,” Rieder said at the recent Yahoo Finance Invest conference. He’s the chief investment officer of fixed income for the asset management giant, and his remit also includes overseeing $150 billion of equities. Rieder said there are two forces supporting equities. First, earnings are growing. “I think the multiples are high. But if you think the E in PE [price-earnings ratio] is going to be significantly higher, you get that multiple to a reasonable level.” Second, “The technicals are crazy for equities,” Rieder said. That’s in part because of the lack of sellers, as the massive amount of dollars in 401(k)s allocated to stocks, plus companies buying back their own shares, provides lots of buyers. As for Stoltzfus, the chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management, he just raised his year-end 2024 target for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) for the third time. He was one of the most bullish strategists on the Street coming into the year, and he now sees the index closing out at 6,200. (He has yet to set his forecast for 2025). Stoltzfus told Yahoo Finance in an interview that stocks, the economy, and business growth have continued to defy expectations. ""Second and third quarter earnings growth and revenue growth have outperformed consensus expectations,"" he said. ""We were looking for much less growth. And then the Fed has been remarkably successful [at averting a recession]. The consumer and jobs have all proven resilient, even if slowing somewhat is a result of the effects of the Fed going after inflation for over two, two and a half years."" Of course, that’s not even factoring in the fiscal policy of the incoming Trump administration, which many strategists expect to help further juice growth. One of them is Ed Yardeni, who recently set a target of 7,000 for the S&P 500 for the end of 2025 and said the election had reignited “animal spirits” in the market. “I think we're just seeing a more pro-business administration coming in that undoubtedly will cut taxes,” Yardeni said in an interview with Yahoo Finance. “And not only for corporations but also for individuals. Lots of various kinds of tax cuts have been discussed, and in addition to that, a lot of deregulation. So we're upping our estimates for what profit margins are going to be doing over the next couple of years.” Rieder and Stoltzfus agree that a far-off potential risk for stocks and the economy more broadly could be the ballooning of the US deficit and debt, and a possible resultant buyers' strike in the Treasury market that could send yields higher. However, markets aren’t concerned at the moment. “I think markets tend to react to the shark closest to the boat,” Rieder said. “The shark on the debt dynamic is not going to be next to the boat in January or February, but it is going to get next to the boat sometime. I don't know if it's the latter part of 2025 or the beginning of 2026 unless they address the size of the spending dynamics, the amount of debt we're issuing, and, then obviously, inflation relative to that.” Last week showed euphoria was dampened but perhaps not eliminated. The S&P 500 had its worst week since September, falling 2.1%. That also means it closed 2.1% below its record high of 6,001.35, a level that could be quickly surpassed if the “animal spirits” that Yardeni invoked reassert themselves.

155,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/this-week-in-bidenomics-uh-oh-reflation-150041895.html,"Sat, Nov 16, 2024, 7:00 AM"," Is the dragon slain? Or just wounded? Inflation has been the scourge of the economy for the last three years. It spiked from a benign 1.4% when President Biden took office in 2021 to a searing 9% some 18 months later. The Federal Reserve took aim with speedy interest rate hikes, and it seemed to work. By September, inflation was down to 2.4%, almost in the normal zone. Then, an upward blip. The latest data shows inflation ticked back up to 2.6% in October. That could be a spot on the X-ray that turns out to be nothing. Or it could signal that inflation is making a comeback, which would scramble the outlook for interest rates, financial markets, and the policies of the incoming Trump administration. The inflation uptick in October wasn’t a fluke based on hurricanes or other one-time anomalies. Most important goods and services categories rose, including food, energy, rent, and vehicles. This came one month after the Fed basically declared victory over inflation. In September, the Fed reversed monetary policy and started cutting interest rates, signaling that the time had come to worry more about keeping growth humming than about getting prices down. The Fed is staying the course for now. It cut short-term rates again on Nov. 14 and may do so again at its next policy meeting in December. But the odds of more rate cuts are dropping, with policymakers waiting for more lab results in the form of forthcoming inflation data. “Inflation might soon be front-page news again,” Capital Economics announced in a Nov. 13 analysis. The forecasting firm argues that the currently inflationary trend is OK, but the future outlook is more worrisome — in large part because of what Donald Trump plans to do once he takes office next January. At least two elements of Trump’s agenda are inflationary: new tariffs on imports and the mass deportation of undocumented migrants. Tariffs are taxes that raise the cost of imported goods directly. Deporting migrants would reduce the size of the labor force, especially targeting lower-wage workers. Replacing them with workers who might demand higher pay — or with costly machines — would raise costs one way or another, with producers passing as much as they could on to consumers. A third inflation concern is Trump’s desire to cut taxes further, which can have a stimulus effect by putting more money in people’s pockets, boosting spending and demand and sometimes leading to higher prices. Drop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter. “Given all that President-elect Trump has promised to do quickly — such as hike tariffs, cut taxes further and slash immigration — one can easily foresee a re-acceleration of inflation next year,” Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at Economic Outlook Group, wrote on Nov. 13. “The Federal Reserve is now in a real quandary.” The stock market has been buoyant since Trump won a second term on Nov. 5. But the bond market is registering concern. Since the Fed started cutting short-term rates in mid-September, long-term rates have gone the other direction, with the 10-year Treasury rising eight-tenths of a percentage point. The rates on mortgages and most consumer and business loans track the 10-year Treasury, so borrowing costs for just about everybody have been going up for the past two months. Bond investors seem to be betting that inflation is going back up and therefore demanding a higher rate of return to lock in their money. Inflation pushes long-term rates up in two ways: If the Fed must once again start raising short-term rates to fight inflation, that can impact long-term rates. Higher rates are also a hedge against money that loses its value faster when inflation is higher. If this all plays out, Trump could face a bracing headwind as he takes office. Consumers feel badly burned by inflation, which clearly contributed to voters’ rejection of the incumbent Democrats and Kamala Harris’s defeat in this year’s presidential election. Consumer confidence has been slowly improving as inflation has come down, but it could plunge again if people see another wave of inflation looming. Many consumers holding out for a more affordable home or car purchase have been waiting, and hoping, for lower rates. That may not happen anytime soon, exacerbating the high cost of housing in particular. If voters transfer their inflation frustrations to Trump, he could end up just as politically weak as President Biden, whose approval rating sank as inflation set in and never recovered. Trump has some control over the kind of economy he will preside over. He could impose tariff and deportation policies much tamer than he promised as a candidate, which might generate relief in markets, bringing inflation expectations and interest rates down. Reflation is a possibility but not a certainty. If Trump learns anything from Biden, he’ll do just about anything to prevent it. Rick Newman is a senior columnist for Yahoo Finance.

Replacing them with who might demand higher pay — or with costly machines — would raise costs one way or another, with producers passing as much as they could on to consumers. A third inflation concern is Trump’s desire to cut taxes further, which a stimulus effect by putting more money in people’s pockets, boosting spending and demand and sometimes leading to higher prices. Drop Rick Newman a note, him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter. “Given all that President-elect Trump has promised to do quickly — such as hike tariffs, cut taxes further and slash immigration — can easily foresee a re-acceleration of next year,” Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at Economic Outlook Group, wrote on Nov. “The Federal Reserve is now in real The stock market has been buoyant since Trump a second term Nov. 5. But the market is concern. Since the started cutting rates in mid-September, rates have gone the other direction, with the 10-year Treasury rising of a percentage point. The rates on mortgages and most consumer and business loans track the 10-year Treasury, so borrowing costs for just about everybody have been going up for the past two months. Bond investors seem to that inflation is going back up and therefore demanding a higher rate of return in money. Inflation pushes long-term rates up in two ways: If the Fed once again start raising rates to fight inflation, that can impact long-term rates.

And while that could raise prices on everything from jeans to children’s toys for everyday Americans, Trump has also floated the idea of another tariff that could impact Wall Street’s current favorite trade: AI. During an appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast ahead of the election, Trump lambasted the idea of the CHIPS Act, a bipartisan piece of legislation Biden signed in 2022 designed to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US. He called it “so bad.” Instead of using legislation and billions in subsidies to bring chip-building facilities to the US, Trump said tariffs would have the same effect. In Trump’s estimation, putting tariffs on semiconductors from Taiwan would force chip builders, like TSMC, to construct chip manufacturing plants, or fabs, in the US to avoid having to pay the added tax. But there’s no guarantee chip builders wouldn’t simply move the added cost down the line to their customers and forego spending cash on expensive US facilities. Such a move could also end up cutting into profit margins for companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD), which rely on chips built in Taiwan, unless they similarly pass those costs down to their own customers. And that could have ripple effects across the tech industry. “If the argument is that this is the way to force it to move here, TSMC is already moving here,” explained William Reinsch, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. “They're already building a fab plant in Arizona. That's all already underway and the tariffs aren't going to make that move any faster. If anything, they might complicate the effort.” Trump has continuously pushed the idea of tariffs as a means of targeting the US trade deficit and bringing manufacturing jobs back to America. He’s already said he wants to see a 10% to 20% tax on all imported products and a 60% tax on Chinese goods. During his interview with Rogan, Trump said that instead of moving forward with the CHIPS Act, he would have put tariffs on chips coming out of Taiwan, though he didn’t say how much. The US has made reshoring chip manufacturing a major national security objective after the pandemic exposed the fragility of the global chip supply chain—and America’s reliance on other countries for advanced semiconductors. According to a 2023 US International Trade Commission working paper, 44% of US imports of logic chips — central processing units (CPUs), graphics processing units (GPUs), etc. — came from Taiwan as of 2021. In the event of a “major manufacturing disruption,” the working paper estimated that the price of logic chips would jump as much as 59%, and US capacity would only be able to fill a portion of the gap left by the lack of Taiwanese imports. The CHIPS Act is supposed to increase chip manufacturing in the US and some companies are already moving to construct new facilities in the country with the promise of funding coming down the pike. Experts, meanwhile, are torn on whether the president-elect will move forward on such an import tax. Futurum Group CEO Dan Newman said that Trump’s threats were likely nothing more than political posturing for election season rather than a flat-out promise that he would definitely move ahead with tariffs. “Trump is unlikely to move forward with anything that hurts the economy because that’s what he wants to be known for,” Newman told Yahoo Finance. But others, like Columbia Business School associate professor Lori Yue, say there’s a high probability that Trump will move forward with chip tariffs. If Trump does hit Taiwan-built chips with tariffs, Yue said, it will mean higher prices for Nvidia and other chip companies that get their chips from the country. But, she added, the increase in chip sales that could come as a result of deregulation related to AI under a second Trump administration might help offset those price increases. Newman, for his part, said that tariffs on chips out of Taiwan could eventually force chip designers to lean on Intel’s (INTC) facilities in the US at a time when that company is seeking third-party chip customers. For now, the chip industry, and those companies that rely on it, will have to wait and see what Trump decides to do when he takes office in January. Until then, anything is on the table.

157,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/my-trump-trade-went-bust--with-a-consolation-prize-200414417.html,"Mon, Nov 18, 2024, 12:04 PM"," I bet against Donald Trump, and lost. I got ahead, anyway. In the final days of the 2024 US election, the “Trump trade” was getting woolly. Investors who thought Trump would win or lose the presidential race were betting for or against the impact his economic policies might have. New tariffs on imports might be bad for shippers and good for domestic producers. Tax cuts could generate larger deficits and higher interest rates. Deregulation could yield more corporate mergers. The most direct Trump trade was a bet on the shares of Trump’s own company, Trump Media & Technology Group, known by its ticker symbol DJT. A Trump win could boost the fortunes of the flagging Truth Social network, while a Trump loss could doom the money-losing venture. The stock price was yo-yoing based on every hint that Trump was up or down in the polls. I decided to sample the action. I wanted to place an options trade on DJT, because that’s the way many other Trump traders were playing it. I’m a plain vanilla investor, so I asked Eric Hale, founder and CEO of Trader Oasis, to guide me through an options trade. I didn’t know if Trump would win or lose, but I thought shares of DJT, which had been trading around $50, were seriously overpriced. The company was a social media pipsqueak with barely any revenue, yet the stock price gave it a market value of $8 billion. That seemed way too high under any election outcome. I bought a put contract with a strike price of $25, which meant I could sell 100 shares at a profit if the price fell below $25 before my contract expired on Nov. 15. The contract cost $3.90 per share for 100 shares, so $390 in total. I’d make a profit of about $1,110 if the price dropped to $10, and $2,500 if it went to 0. If the price never fell below $25 by Nov. 15, I’d be out the full $390. For a few days, it looked promising. The stock closed at $40 the day I bought my put. It fell to nearly $30 the following day, which pushed the market value of the put higher than what I paid for it. I could have closed the trade then for a small profit. But I wanted to go the distance. Trump won, of course, which should have demolished my Trump trade. But instead of soaring after Trump’s win — which was the expectation trading action had been signaling — the stock languished. There was a brief uptick once the election outcome was clear, but then the stock fell to $30, then $27. A couple of bucks lower and I’d get back at least get some of my money. Drop Rick Newman a note, follow him on Twitter, or sign up for his newsletter. On Nov. 15, the day my put expired, the stock crawled back to about $28. I was out of luck and my $390 was gone. It was my second failure to capitalize on an investing fad. In 2021, I tried my hand at meme stock investing by buying shares of BlackBerry. I went underwater right away and ended up losing $1,760. Other Trump traders hit the jackpot. The “French whale” who wagered $70 million on a Trump win on the betting site Polymarket took home an $85 million profit. Big bank shareholders saw handsome gains on the likelihood of softer regulation. Anybody who owned the beaten-down shares of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac enjoyed a 70% pop on hopes that Trump will privatize the two federal housing agencies. I should swear off trendy investing ideas, except I got it right once. I bought a bit of cryptocurrency during the heady days of 2017, when bitcoin was starting to garner mainstream attention. A year or two later, I bought stock in a crypto-related company. Trump’s win in 2024 turned out to be bullish for crypto, since he’s promised friendly policies. I didn’t plan it this way, but my crypto gains offset the $390 loss, and then some, and then some more. My Trump trade also gave me a rudimentary understanding of how to place option trades. My main takeaway: Leave it to the pros. But if I get laid off and decide to become a day trader, I got a wee bit of starter education. I also paid closer attention to Trump’s company than I would have if I'd had no stake in it. The stock jumped after Trump said on Nov. 8 that he had no plan to sell his shares, as some of the company’s backers had feared. But other company insiders did sell shares, which seemed to drag down the stock. Three days after my Trump put expired, worthless, the stock was back to around $27, close, once again, to my strike price.

On Monday, BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski initiated a 2025 year-end target of 6,700 for the S&P 500. On Sunday, Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson issued a 12-month target of 6,500 for the S&P 500. Belski's target reflects about 14% upside from Friday's close; the strategist already has a 6,100 year-end target for 2024. This puts Belski's forecast for returns in 2025 at 9.8%, right in line with the index's average historical gain. Wilson's 12-month target represents a nearly 11% increase for the benchmark index over the next year. Should the S&P 500 finish 2024 with a gain above 20%, it would mark the first time the benchmark index has posted consecutive years with gains of 20% or more since the tech bubble of 1998-1999. Any way you slice it, then, these outlooks say the outsized returns the S&P 500 has enjoyed for each of the past two years will come to an end in 2025. ""It is clearly time for markets to take a somewhat of a breather,"" Belski wrote. ""Bull markets can, will and should slow their pace from time-to-time, a period of digestion that in turn only accentuates the health of the underlying secular bull. So we believe 2025 will likely [be] defined by a more normalized return environment with more balanced performance across sectors, sizes, and styles."" Belski points out that the historical pattern for bull markets sees returns in year three come in below gains for the first two years and below the index's typical average return. ""Now that inflation, interest rates (zero percent is NOT normal) and employment are showing signs of stabilizing (volatility diminishing), US stock fundamentals have their best chance to normalize,"" Belski wrote. ""According to our work, an environment of high single digit annual price gains coupled with at or near double digit earnings growth and price to earnings ratios in the high teens to low twenties over the next few years would be a good start on the path to normalization."" With the Federal Reserve cutting interest rates while US economic growth remains strong, both Belski and Wilson believe in a continued broadening of the stock market rally, where more than just a few high-flying tech names are driving the market action. ""We expect this broadening in earnings growth to continue as the Fed cuts rates into next year and business cycle indicators continue to improve,"" Wilson wrote. ""A potential rise in corporate animal spirits post the election could catalyze a more balanced earnings profile across the market in 2025."" Wilson and Belski agree that this likely creates stock-picking opportunities beneath the surface of the S&P 500. But it could also be part of what leads to lower returns at the index level, with smaller stocks by definition having less of an impact on the movement of the overall index. ""We believe the slight [second half of 2024] rotation out of technology+ mega cap stocks is a trend that will likely continue and if so, the sheer size of the stocks within the index will make big market gains more difficult (but not impossible) to achieve as the rest of the S&P 500 plays the catch-up game,"" Belski wrote.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell 0.2%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was up 0.4%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.6%, buoyed by a jump in Tesla stock. Stocks started the week trying to break out of a funk, which saw the S&P 500 reverse around half of its Trump-fueled rally after sharp weekly losses for the major gauges, led by tech. Signs of a robust economy, combined with comments from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, have prompted investors to downsize expectations for rate cuts. But the tech sector showed signs of a comeback Monday, with EV maker Tesla leading the way, rising more than 5% in the wake of a Bloomberg report that President-elect Donald Trump's team is looking to ease US rules for self-driving vehicles. Read more: What the Fed rate cut means for bank accounts, CDs, loans, and credit cards Elsewhere in tech, eyes are now on Nvidia's earnings report on Wednesday for insight into the strength of the AI trade, which has helped drive the S&P 500's gains over the past year. Shares slipped slightly on Monday as production of its flagship Blackwell chip came into focus. Wall Street also continues to monitor Trump's picks for his cabinet, after his choice of Robert F. Kennedy Jr for top health official rattled vaccine stocks. The incoming president has named Brendan Carr, a critic of Big Techs such as Meta and Apple, as chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. The wait is now on to learn who will win the frenzied race to become Trump's Treasury secretary. Trump Media & Technology Group (DJT) gained 16% in afternoon trading after The Financial Times reported the parent company of Truth Social is in talks to acquire crypto trading venue Bakkt (BKKT). Shares of Bakkt soared more than 169% on the headline. Meanwhile, bitcoin (BTC-USD) — also a key Trump trade — has rebounded from its biggest retreat since the election at the weekend.

After two years of annual gains north of 20% for the S&P 500 (^GSPC), Wall Street strategists think 2025 will see a more measured year for stocks. On Monday, BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski initiated a 2025 year-end target of 6,700 for the S&P 500. On Sunday, Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson issued a 12-month target of 6,500 for the S&P 500. Belski's target reflects about 14% upside from Friday's close; the strategist already has a 6,100 year-end target for 2024. This puts Belski's forecast for returns in 2025 at 9.8%, right in line with the index's average historical gain. Wilson's 12-month target represents a nearly 11% increase for the benchmark index over the next year. Should the S&P 500 finish 2024 with a gain above 20%, it would mark the first time the benchmark index has posted consecutive years with gains of 20% or more since the tech bubble of 1998-1999. Any way you slice it, then, these outlooks say the outsized returns the S&P 500 has enjoyed for each of the past two years will come to an end in 2025. ""It is clearly time for markets to take a somewhat of a breather,"" Belski wrote. Read more here. Yahoo Finance's Ben Werschkul reports.

November’s reading was higher than economists’ estimates of 43, according to Bloomberg data. Still, any reading under 50 indicates more builders view conditions as poor rather than good. “With the elections now in the rearview mirror, builders are expressing increasing confidence that Republicans gaining all the levers of power in Washington will result in significant regulatory relief for the industry that will lead to the construction of more homes and apartments,” NAHB chairman Carl Harris, a custom homebuilder from Wichita, Kan., wrote in a press statement. Meanwhile, mortgage rates continued their recent rise, with the average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate loan holding at 6.78% last week from 6.79% a week earlier, according to Freddie Mac.

The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage fell as low as 6.08% in early September. ""While the stock market cheered the election result, the bond market has concerns, as indicated by a rise for long-term interest rates,"" said NAHB chief economist Robert Dietz.

Last week, the top contenders appeared to be Howard Lutnick, CEO of Cantor Fitzgerald, and Scott Bessent, a former Soros Fund Management investing chief. But the water is now murkier than ever after a weekend of even more intense back-and-forth unlike anything surrounding Trump's other picks so far. ""Would be interesting to hear more people weigh in on this,"" Elon Musk even asked his 200+ million followers on social media platform X on Saturday before making his own views clear. ""My view fwiw is that Bessent is a business-as-usual choice, whereas [Lutnick] will actually enact change."" But even Musk hasn't been able to put an end to the debate, with Bessent still being pushed by prominent backers in Trump's orbit but new contenders apparently now in consideration. On Sunday, the New York Times reported that Lutnick has ""gotten on Mr. Trump’s nerves lately."" The president-elect is now expected to meet this week with former Federal Reserve governor Kevin Warsh and Apollo Global Management CEO Marc Rowan in a sign he is unsatisfied with his choices. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management). While much of the jockeying appears to be about not spooking the stock market with a controversial pick, much of the debate playing out in public appears to be about finding a candidate who is credible to business leaders but also on board with Trump's economic ideas, specifically tariffs. Trump has long championed import duties as a potential ""ring around the country"" but the business community has often been much less sanguine about his ideas. Read more: How do tariffs work, and who really pays them? The attempt to bridge the divide has been on display for weeks. ""When was America great?"" Lutnick asked the crowd at Madison Square Garden before the election and before discussing the 1890s as an era where ""all we had was tariffs"" and the economy was ""rocking."" It got a cheer but was clearly designed to appeal mostly to Trump himself, who talked about the era of William McKinley pretty much nonstop on the campaign trail. Bessent weighed in last week with a Fox News op-ed in which he argued that tariffs have a ""long and storied history as both a revenue-raising tool and a way of protecting strategically important industries."" As for Rowan, when he was asked about a possible trade war during an appearance at Yahoo Finance's Invest conference last week, he downplayed the chances, saying, ""Markets ... at the moment are not pricing in much for geopolitical risk."" He then quickly pivoted to arguing that Trump isn't a risk for global instability because of his strength. The clear tension is that many of these candidates have often espoused more free trade efforts in the past and even, in the case of Warsh, have discussed ""the false promise of protectionism."" How that would work in a Trump administration that appears determined to go ahead with high duties remains to be seen, but the prospect of the tariffs has already led to considerable unease in the business community about their effect on everyday items and manufacturing inputs. President-elect Trump is expected to meet with his additional candidates this week, according to multiple reports, signaling a process that could continue in the days ahead. The Wall Street Journal also reported that Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee could also be in the mix The president-elect's quickly changing preferences have already hung over the entire transition process after other picks have surprised political observers multiple times with conventional choices for other posts being discarded in favor of nominees that few saw coming. Other candidates have publicly announced they aren't in the running for the job. Last Tuesday, billionaire investor John Paulson took his hat out of the ring for contention, saying ""complex financial obligations"" would keep him in the private sector. JPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon also made it clear Thursday that he won't be working for Trump in the coming years. Fox Business host Larry Kudlow was also briefly mentioned as a candidate before representatives of the anchor told multiple reporters he is looking instead to stay with the network. The treasury secretary pick is also closely scrutinized, as it could be holding up other prominent economic choices, such as the next commerce secretary, National Economic Council director, and trade representative. Trump has nonetheless gone ahead with other economic-facing posts, announcing Brendan Carr as chairman of the Federal Communications Commission and Chris Wright as secretary of energy.

163,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-holidays-are-coming-and-experts-say-americans-will-be-opening-their-wallets-144804659.html,"Sun, Nov 17, 2024, 6:48 AM"," A version of this story first appeared on TKer.co Americans plan to spend more on holiday shopping this year than they did last year. That’s the takeaway from pretty much every consumer survey conducted over the past several weeks. Below are some highlights (emphasis added): “Our proprietary survey of ~2,000 US consumers reveals a more positive outlook for holiday shopping versus 2023 and 2022. Overall, 37% of consumers are planning to keep their holiday budgets roughly the same, 35% expect to spend more, and 22% expect to spend less yielding a net of +13%.” - Morgan Stanley (11/13) “Consumer sentiment has also shown signs of improvement, and the 2024 Bank of America Holiday Survey suggests people are planning to spend $2,100 outside of typical obligations and necessities this holiday season, up 7% YoY.”- BofA (11/12) “According to The Conference Board Holiday Spending Survey, the average US consumer intends to spend $1,063 in nominal terms on holiday-related purchases in 2024, up 7.9% from $985 in 2023. This is also higher than in 2022 ($1,006) and 2021 ($1,022). On gifts, consumers plan to spend an average of $677, up 3.4% from $654 last year. After slumping last year, consumers’ budgets for non-gift items such as food, decorations, and wrapping paper are also up 17% at $387.” - The Conference Board (11/12) “Some 89% of consumers admitted they're tempted to spend more than they should during the holiday season, while 94% indicated they'd be tempted to make an unplanned purchase if the item were on sale. Over half (55%) of consumers said holiday deals have caused them to overspend; these big spenders said they are most likely to splurge on gifts for others.”- Experian (11/4) “Consumers are reaching a little deeper into their pockets this season, their average holiday budget rising 4% y-o-y to $613, according to Accenture's 18th Annual Holiday Shopping Survey.” - Accenture (10/30) “In a year when sustained consumer spending propelled growth and helped the economy skirt recession, we're calling for a fairly modest holiday sales season. We look for holiday sales to rise just 3.3% in November and December compared to last year, which is slower than last year and below the long-run average.” - Wells Fargo (10/28) “Gallup’s initial measure of Americans’ 2024 holiday spending intentions finds consumers planning to spend an average of $1,014 on Christmas or other holiday gifts. This is substantially more than their forecast of $923 at the same time last year, signaling that the 2024 holiday shopping season could be a bit kinder to U.S. retailers.” - Gallup (10/25) “Consumer spending on the winter holidays is expected to reach a record $902 per person on average across gifts, food, decorations and other seasonal items, according to the National Retail Federation’s latest consumer survey conducted by Prosper Insights & Analytics. The amount is about $25 per person more than last year’s figure and $16 higher than the previous record set in 2019.” - National Retail Federation (10/22) “U.S. consumers are set to spend 4% more on holiday shopping this year, with average spending projected to reach $948, compared to $911 in 2023, according to the KPMG 2024 Consumer Holiday Shopping Survey.” - KPMG (10/21) “After expressing record holiday spending intentions in 2023, respondents are yet again planning to up their purchases, and expect to spend $1,778 (+8% year over year) this holiday season. The uptick in spend is attributed to a rosier economic outlook (+9 percentage points [PP]), perceived higher prices (70%), and an increase in spend by the $100K to $199K income group (+17%).” - Deloitte (10/15) “Despite 59% of consumers saying that inflation will probably influence their holiday spending this year, overall spending is projected to increase by 7% to an average of $1,638 per shopper.” - PwC (10/1) We’ll have to wait to see if consumers come through and actually spend more this year. If they do, it would be consistent with the years-long narrative of record consumer spending. Just this past Friday, we learned retail sales in October rose to a record $718.9 billion. All this spending has been supported by healthy household balance sheets and real income growth. Sure, households aren’t as flush as they were earlier in the economic recovery — but they remain strong relative to history. This is best reflected by the debt-to-income ratio, which remains at historically low levels even as aggregate debt has been rising. “Although household balances continue to rise in nominal terms, growth in income has outpaced debt,” wrote Donghoon Lee, Economic Research Advisor at the New York Fed. It’s a reminder to take headlines like “US Household Debt Rises to $17.94 Trillion: N.Y. Fed"" and “Credit card debt hits record $1.17 trillion“ with caution because they lack the context you need to avoid drawing the wrong conclusions. Better headlines read like “Household debt is up, but Americans are in a better spot to pay it"" and “NY Fed says household debt up in third quarter as rising incomes ease debt burden."" And in case you’re wondering: Households have a long way to go before they max out their credit cards. Yes, debt delinquencies have been rising. It’s an economic warning sign to keep an eye on. But for now, they can be characterized as normalizing. “Aggregate delinquency rates edged up from the previous quarter, with 3.5% of outstanding debt in some stage of delinquency,“ New York Fed researchers noted. That’s significantly below Q4 2019 levels. Also, it’s notable that wage growth has outpaced inflation for 18 months. “This is how most Americans will ultimately be able to get ahead,” The Washington Post’s Heather Long wrote. “Prices won't go down, but wages will go up enough to offset the higher prices.” We’re also on a 46-month streak of net job creation in America. When more people have jobs, more people have money to spend. With a new political party moving into the White House next year, we can expected an upheaval in consumer sentiment. But as we’ve learned in recent years, people won’t put their lives on hold just because sentiment is poor. If they have money, they will spend it. There were a few notable data points and macroeconomic developments from last week to consider: Shopping rises to new record level. Retail sales increased 0.4% in October to a record $718.9 billion. Strength was broad with growth in electronics, cars and parts, restaurants and bars, building materials, and online shopping. Card spending data is holding up. From JPMorgan: “As of 08 Nov 2024, our Chase Consumer Card spending data (unadjusted) was 0.8% above the same day last year. Based on the Chase Consumer Card data through 08 Nov 2024, our estimate of the US Census November control measure of retail sales m/m is 0.35%.” Unemployment claims tick lower. Initial claims for unemployment benefits declined to 217,000 during the week ending November 9, down from 221,000 the week prior. This metric continues to be at levels historically associated with economic growth. Inflation remains cool. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in October was up 2.6% from a year ago, up from the 2.4% rate in September. This remains near February 2021 lows. Adjusted for food and energy prices, core CPI was up 3.3%, unchanged from the prior month’s level. On a month-over-month basis, CPI was up 0.2%. Core CPI increased by 0.3%. If you annualize the six-month trend in the monthly figures — a reflection of the short-term trend in prices — core CPI climbed 2.6%. Inflation expectations remain cool. From the New York Fed’s October Survey of Consumer Expectations: “Median inflation expectations fell at all three horizons in October. One-year-ahead inflation expectations declined by 0.1 percentage point to 2.9%, three-year-ahead inflation expectations declined by 0.2 percentage point to 2.5%, and five-year-ahead inflation expectations declined by 0.1 percentage point to 2.8%.” However, the introduction of tariffs as proposed by president-elect Donald Trump would be inflationary. For more, read: Wall Street agrees: Tariffs are bad Gas prices tick lower. From AAA: “The national average for a gallon of gas is now less than a dime away from dipping below $3 for the first time since May of 2021. But the possible formation of a new hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico could delay or even temporarily reverse the decline in pump prices. Since last week, the national average dropped two cents to $3.08.” Mortgage rates tick lower. According to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage declined to 6.78%, down from 6.79% last week. From Freddie Mac: “After a six-week climb, rates have leveled off, but overall affordability continues to be an issue for potential homebuyers. Freddie Mac’s latest research shows that mortgage payments compared to rents on the same homes are elevated relative to most of the last three decades.” There are 147 million housing units in the U.S., of which 86.6 million are owner-occupied and 34 million of which are mortgage-free. Of those carrying mortgage debt, almost all have fixed-rate mortgages, and most of those mortgages have rates that were locked in before rates surged from 2021 lows. All of this is to say: Most homeowners are not particularly sensitive to movements in home prices or mortgage rates. Importantly, the more tangible “hard” components of the index continue to hold up much better than the more sentiment-oriented “soft” components. Industrial activity ticks lower. Industrial production activity in October fell 0.3% from the prior month. Manufacturing output fell 0.5%. From the Federal Reserve: “A strike at a major producer of civilian aircraft held down total IP growth by an estimated 0.3 percentage point in September and 0.2 percentage point in October. Hurricane Milton and the lingering effects of Hurricane Helene together reduced October IP growth 0.1 percentage point.“ This is the stuff pros are worried about. According to BofA’s November Global Fund Manager Survey: “On tail risks… 32% of November FMS investors view higher inflation as the #1 biggest 'tail risk' (up from 26% in October). Concerns over geopolitical conflict took the 2nd place spot this month at 21% (down from 33% last month).” Offices remain relatively empty. From Kastle Systems: “Peak day office occupancy on Tuesday dropped more than five full points from the prior week to 57% as many workers went to the polls on Election Day. Occupancy also declined on Wednesday compared to the previous week, dropping 3.6 points to 57.8%. Washington, DC saw the largest decrease with its peak occupancy day dropping more than nine points to 50% on Thursday. The average low was on Friday at 32.6%, down six tenths of a point from last week.“ Near-term GDP growth estimates remain positive. The Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model sees real GDP growth climbing at a 2.5% rate in Q4. Putting it all together The long-term outlook for the stock market remains favorable, bolstered by expectations for years of earnings growth. And earnings are the most important driver of stock prices. Demand for goods and services is positive, and the economy continues to grow. At the same time, economic growth has normalized from much hotter levels earlier in the cycle. The economy is less “coiled” these days as major tailwinds like excess job openings have faded. To be clear: The economy remains very healthy, supported by strong consumer and business balance sheets. Job creation remains positive. And the Federal Reserve — having resolved the inflation crisis — has shifted its focus toward supporting the labor market. We are in an odd period given that the hard economic data has decoupled from the soft sentiment-oriented data. Consumer and business sentiment has been relatively poor, even as tangible consumer and business activity continue to grow and trend at record levels. From an investor’s perspective, what matters is that the hard economic data continues to hold up. Analysts expect the U.S. stock market could outperform the U.S. economy, thanks largely due to positive operating leverage. Since the pandemic, companies have adjusted their cost structures aggressively. This has come with strategic layoffs and investment in new equipment, including hardware powered by AI. These moves are resulting in positive operating leverage, which means a modest amount of sales growth — in the cooling economy — is translating to robust earnings growth. Of course, this does not mean we should get complacent. There will always be risks to worry about — such as U.S. political uncertainty, geopolitical turmoil, energy price volatility, cyber attacks, etc. There are also the dreaded unknowns. Any of these risks can flare up and spark short-term volatility in the markets. There’s also the harsh reality that economic recessions and bear markets are developments that all long-term investors should expect to experience as they build wealth in the markets. Always keep your stock market seat belts fastened. For now, there’s no reason to believe there’ll be a challenge that the economy and the markets won’t be able to overcome over time. The long game remains undefeated, and it’s a streak long-term investors can expect to continue.

The amount is about $25 per more than last figure and $16 higher than previous record set in 2019.” - National Retail Federation (10/22) “U.S. consumers are set spend 4% more on holiday shopping this year, with average spending to reach $948, compared to $911 in 2023, according to the KPMG 2024 Consumer Holiday Shopping Survey.” - KPMG (10/21) “After expressing record holiday spending intentions in 2023, are again planning to up their purchases, and expect to spend $1,778 (+8% year over year) this holiday season. uptick in spend is attributed a economic outlook (+9 percentage points [PP]), perceived higher prices (70%), and an increase spend by the $100K to $199K income group (+17%).” - Deloitte (10/15) “Despite 59% consumers saying that inflation probably influence their holiday spending this year, spending is projected to increase by 7% to an average of $1,638 per shopper.” - PwC (10/1) We’ll have to wait to see consumers through and actually spend more this year. If they would be with the years-long narrative of record consumer spending. Just this past Friday, we learned retail sales in October rose to a record $718.9 billion. All this spending has been supported by healthy household balance sheets and real income growth. Sure, households as flush as they were earlier in the economic recovery — but they relative to history. This is best by the debt-to-income ratio, which remains at historically low levels even as aggregate debt has “Although household continue to rise in nominal terms, growth in income has outpaced debt,” wrote Donghoon Lee, Economic Research Advisor the New York Fed. It’s a reminder to take headlines like “US Household Rises to $17.94 Trillion: N.Y. and “Credit card hits record $1.17 with caution they lack the context you need to avoid drawing conclusions. Better headlines read like “Household debt is up, but Americans are in better spot to pay it"" and “NY says household debt up in quarter as rising incomes ease debt burden."" And in case you’re Households have long way to go out their credit cards. Yes, debt have been rising. It’s an economic warning sign to an eye on. But for now, they can be as normalizing. “Aggregate delinquency rates up from the previous quarter, with 3.5% outstanding debt in some stage of delinquency,“ New York Fed researchers That’s significantly below Q4 2019 levels. Also, it’s notable that wage growth has outpaced inflation 18 months. “This is how most Americans will ultimately be able to ahead,” The Washington Post’s Heather Long “Prices won't go down, but wages will go up enough to offset the higher prices.” We’re also on a streak of net job creation in America. When more people have jobs, more people have money spend. With a new political party moving into White House next year, we can expected an upheaval consumer sentiment. But as we’ve learned in recent years, people won’t put their on hold just because sentiment is poor. If they have money, they will spend it. There were a few notable data macroeconomic developments from last to consider: Shopping rises to new record level. Retail sales increased 0.4% in October to a record $718.9 billion. was broad with growth in electronics, cars and restaurants and bars, building materials, and online shopping. Card data is holding up. From JPMorgan: “As of 08 2024, our Chase Consumer Card spending data (unadjusted) was 0.8% above the same day last year. Based on the Chase Consumer Card through 08 Nov 2024, our estimate of the US Census November control measure of sales is 0.35%.” Unemployment claims tick Initial claims unemployment benefits declined to 217,000 during the week ending November 9, down from the week prior. This continues to at levels historically associated with economic growth. Inflation remains cool. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) in October was up 2.6% from a year ago, up from the in September. This near February 2021 lows. Adjusted for food and energy prices, core CPI was up 3.3%, unchanged from the prior month’s level. On a month-over-month basis, CPI was Core CPI increased by 0.3%. If you annualize the six-month trend in monthly figures — reflection of the trend in prices — core CPI climbed Inflation expectations remain cool. From York Fed’s October Survey of Consumer Expectations: “Median expectations at all three in October. One-year-ahead inflation expectations declined by 0.1 percentage point to 2.9%, three-year-ahead inflation expectations declined by 0.2 percentage point to and inflation expectations declined by 0.1 percentage to 2.8%.” However, introduction of tariffs as proposed president-elect Donald Trump would be inflationary.

From AAA: “The national average for a gallon of gas now less than a dime away from below $3 for the first time since May of 2021. But the possible formation of a new the Gulf of Mexico could or even temporarily reverse the decline in pump prices. Since last week, the national dropped two cents to $3.08.” Mortgage rates tick lower. According to Freddie Mac, the average 30-year mortgage declined 6.78%, down from 6.79% last week. From Freddie Mac: “After a six-week climb, rates have leveled off, but overall affordability continues to an issue for potential homebuyers. Freddie Mac’s latest research shows that mortgage payments compared to rents on the same homes are elevated relative to most of the last three decades.” There are 147 million housing units in the U.S., of which 86.6 million are owner-occupied and million of which are mortgage-free. Of those carrying mortgage debt, almost all have fixed-rate mortgages, and most of those mortgages have rates that were locked in before rates surged from 2021 lows. All of this is to say: Most homeowners are not particularly sensitive to movements in home prices or mortgage Importantly, the more tangible “hard” components of the index continue to hold up much better than the more “soft” components. Industrial activity ticks lower. Industrial production activity in October fell from the prior month. Manufacturing output fell 0.5%. From Reserve: “A strike at a major producer of civilian aircraft held down total IP growth an estimated 0.3 percentage September and 0.2 percentage point in October. Milton and lingering effects of Helene together reduced IP growth 0.1 percentage point.“ This is the stuff are worried about. According to BofA’s November Global Fund Survey: “On tail risks… 32% of FMS investors view higher inflation as the #1 biggest 'tail risk' (up from 26% in October). Concerns over geopolitical conflict took the 2nd place spot this month at 21% (down from 33% last month).” Offices remain relatively empty. From Kastle Systems: day occupancy on Tuesday dropped more than five full points from the prior week to as workers went to the polls on Election Day. Occupancy also declined on Wednesday compared to the previous week, dropping 3.6 points to DC saw the largest decrease with peak occupancy more than nine 50% on Thursday. The average low was on Friday at 32.6%, down tenths of a point from last week.“ GDP growth estimates remain positive. Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow model real GDP growth climbing at a 2.5% in Q4. Putting it all together The long-term outlook for stock market remains favorable, bolstered by expectations for years earnings growth. earnings are the important driver of stock prices. Demand for goods services is positive, and the economy continues to grow. At the same time, economic growth has normalized from much levels earlier in the cycle. The economy is “coiled” these days as major tailwinds like excess job openings have faded. To be clear: The economy remains healthy, supported by strong consumer and business balance Job creation remains positive. And the Federal having resolved the inflation crisis — shifted its toward supporting the labor market. We are in an period given that the hard economic data has decoupled from the soft sentiment-oriented data. Consumer and business sentiment has been relatively poor, even as tangible consumer and business activity continue to grow trend at record From an investor’s perspective, what matters is the hard economic data continues to hold up. Analysts expect the U.S. stock could outperform the U.S. economy, largely due to positive operating leverage. Since the pandemic, companies have adjusted cost structures has come with strategic layoffs and investment in new equipment, including hardware powered by AI. These moves are resulting in positive operating leverage, which means a modest amount of sales growth — in the cooling economy — translating to robust earnings growth. Of course, this does not mean we should get complacent. There will always be risks to worry about — such as political uncertainty, geopolitical turmoil, energy price volatility, cyber attacks, etc. are also the dreaded unknowns. Any of these risks can flare and short-term volatility in the markets. There’s also harsh reality that economic recessions and bear markets are developments all long-term investors should expect experience as they in the Always keep your stock market seat belts fastened. For now, there’s no reason to believe there’ll be a challenge that economy and the markets won’t be able to overcome over time. The long game undefeated, and a streak long-term investors can expect to continue.

164,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/a-big-wall-street-winner-from-trumps-bitcoin-bump-blackrock-111834321.html,"Mon, Nov 18, 2024, 3:18 AM"," BlackRock (BLK) CEO Larry Fink was once a ""proud skeptic"" of bitcoin, but now his money management giant is emerging as one of the biggest beneficiaries of a post-election surge in enthusiasm for the world’s largest cryptocurrency. BlackRock’s spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (IBIT) has swelled by $13 billion since Donald Trump’s win on Nov. 5, according to Yahoo Finance data, pushing iShares Bitcoin Trust past $40 billion in assets just 10 months following its launch. That feat places IBIT among the top 1% of biggest ETFs in record time, according to Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Eric Balchunas. ""We had pretty optimistic projections, but, you know, I don't think anyone's ever going to put down as their base or even, maybe, their bull case that year one is going to rewrite the record book on inflows into the ETF category,"" Robbie Mitchnick, BlackRock’s head of digital assets, said last week on the Unchained podcast. Plenty of other companies are also benefiting from the new boom as investors bet that pro-crypto legislation could be possible in Washington, D.C., under a new Trump administration and a GOP-controlled Congress. Read more: Bitcoin clears another record: Is this a good time to invest? The stock of Coinbase (COIN), the biggest US cryptocurrency exchange, is up 58% since the election. The stock of MicroStrategy (MSTR), a software company that became the largest corporate bitcoin holder, is up 50%. The record inflows to BlackRock illustrate how crypto continues to move into the investing mainstream as it gets embraced by some of the biggest names on Wall Street — even some who were once its biggest critics. Fink, who runs the world’s biggest money manager, falls into that category. ""I was a proud skeptic, and I studied it, learned about it, and I came away saying, 'OK, you know, my opinion [for] five years was wrong,'"" Fink said earlier this year while discussing his previous views with CNBC. Perhaps the best example of that shift came in June 2023 when BlackRock filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a spot bitcoin ETF. That was back when the crypto and asset management industries had little evidence such a product would be approved by SEC Chair Gary Gensler. Yet it and 10 other money managers got the green light in January, followed by a listing on Jan. 12. “BlackRock always seems to be in the right place,” Stephen Biggar, an analyst with Argus Research who covers the asset manager, told Yahoo Finance. Its embrace of crypto (it also launched a smaller spot ether ETF in late July) coincided with an election year where pro-crypto congressional candidates received millions in industry donations and Trump, as a candidate, made a number of promises to the industry. Trump pledged to fire SEC Chair Gensler, one of the industry’s greatest antagonists, appoint a crypto presidential advisory council, and establish a ""strategic national bitcoin stockpile"" with the help of Congress. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) then surged to a new all-time high above $93,000 in the week following Trump’s victory before giving up some of those gains. It is now up 30% since the election and 112% so far in 2024. On the Thursday after the election, spot bitcoin ETFs saw a record $1.3 billion in net assets pour in, according to Kaiko Research, and BlackRock reaped 85% of that total. Its two crypto ETFs now represent approximately 42% of the total $102 billion of value in spot crypto ETFs across the industry. “The amazing thing about this story is that it takes so long to build a good base,” Balchunas told Yahoo Finance. “And they did it so quickly that they were in such a good position to benefit from this rally.""

165,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/markets-look-to-howard-lutnick-other-trump-economic-picks-for-signals-on-tariffs-180200546.html,"Tue, Nov 19, 2024, 12:48 PM"," Donald Trump has been somewhat cagey about his economic and tariff plans since voters elected him president, raising the stakes in a drawn-out contest to lead his economic team while focusing Wall Street's attention on other key posts. And Tuesday offered at least one clue about his direction with one of the tariff-friendliest voices in Trump's orbit, Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick, being announced as the next commerce secretary. Lutnick will, as President-elect Trump put it in the announcement, ""lead our Tariff and Trade agenda."" If confirmed, Lutnick would indeed have a key trade role at the department heading up many enforcement efforts and leading any review process of tariffs Trump aims to impose. Trump also announced Tuesday that Lutnick will have ""direct responsibility"" for the US Trade Representative. It's a key step, but investors are likely to have many additional questions, especially in terms of who Trump puts in the bigger job of Treasury secretary. ""Investors are on edge regarding ... Trump's Treasury Secretary pick and what it might signal about the balance of power within the administration on economic policy,"" wrote Evercore ISI in a note to clients this week. Indeed, reactions to that ongoing selection process suggest that markets have questions about the market-friendliness of Trump's coming administration. Trump is expected to meet with additional candidates for that top post this week — with the chance of a wild card always a distinct possibility. Perhaps channeling the market's desire for some amount of certainty, BTIG director of policy research Isaac Boltansky added in a recent live Yahoo Finance appearance that ""I hope by the end of the week we know who the treasury secretary nominee is."" The unease among business leaders is particularly acute around tariffs and comes after Trump talked about those import duties multiple times a day on the campaign trail. He has been much more circumspect on that subject in recent weeks. The president-elect appeared last Thursday at a gala in Florida and gave a speech that reprised many campaign promises, from cutting energy prices ""in half"" to letting Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ""go wild"" on health issues. But he notably avoided much in the way of economic policy — and didn't get into trade issues at all. In fact, Trump's comments in Tuesday's announcement of Lutnick have been one of his only public comments on the tariff topic in weeks. But trade, in particular, is top of mind for businesses. Retailers have already begun to shift their plans, as have other businesses, but others have little choice but to wait for signals. Any concrete sign from Trump ""is going to be incredibly influential ... because right now, firms are operating in a bit of a vacuum trying to figure out whether or not he's still committed to double-digit, across-the-board tariffs,"" said Wendy Edelberg, director of the Hamilton Project at the Brookings Institution, in a recent interview. During the campaign, Trump promised 60% tariffs on China as well as 10%-20% blanket duties on other trading partners as he again and again extolled tariffs as ""the most beautiful word in the dictionary."" Edelberg predicts that any concrete signal as to whether he intends to follow through will lead many businesses to respond ""quite quickly and aggressively."" Other countries are also being left in suspense. Adam Posen, the president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, offered up in a recent digital event that ""the governments of major economies are making plans to sort of preemptively make offers of various kinds to the Trump administration"" — citing increased natural gas purchases as one carrot to offer in return for backing off tariffs. The question is whether Trump's eventual complete team will be receptive. A ""number of the people close to the president-elect believe trade deficits are a really big deal,"" Posen said, and smaller concessions like energy purchases are unlikely to be satisfying on that front. What's also unclear is who will be atop Trump's team at the Treasury Department as jockeying for that post continues and other preeminent positions remain unfilled, notably the director of the National Economic Council. That latter position is often described as a president's top economic adviser. Trump has also not yet announced a pick for his trade representative, another figure who will be front and center in any tariff conversations alongside Howard Lutnick. Trump is expected to meet with two new treasury candidates — former Federal Reserve governor Kevin Warsh and Apollo Global Management CEO Marc Rowan — in the coming days. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management). Two other contenders appear to be Scott Bessent, a former Soros Fund Management investing chief, and Republican Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee. Lutnick had been seen as a top treasury choice as recently as last week but saw his stock fall there and is now headed to the Commerce department instead. He nonetheless gained considerable attention for pro-tariff comments during the campaign. ""When was America great?"" he asked the crowd at Madison Square Garden before the election and before discussing the 1890s as an era before income taxes when ""all we had was tariffs"" and the economy was ""rocking."" BTIG's Boltansky said in a recent Yahoo Finance appearance that ""if we have Bessent as the pick, I think that it's going to reinforce what many of us, including myself, believe, which is that the market is ultimately going to be a governor on some of Trump's policy moves."" Bessent has written favorably on tariffs but for ""strategically important industries."" The other candidates, Boltansky added, would fall somewhere in between Bessent and Lutnick, who had been seen as possibly signaling ""a more aggressive pushing on the tariff side of the story and perhaps not as much interest in near-term volatility in markets."" Evercore ISI in its note this week cited Bessent as ""the investor favorite"" and noted a Bloomberg report that Bessent could be headed to the National Economic Council and said it could calm some market fears if that comes to be. But the authors were quick to note that there is little sense that uncertainty will go away entirely even once Trump posts his Treasury pick on Truth Social. ""Questions will remain over how much influence this person will actually have over an administration in which the President firmly embraces tariffs,"" they note.

The cost of college tuition at some universities is fast approaching $100,000 per year, and the rise in higher education expenses shows no signs of slowing down, according to Ross Riskin, the chief learning officer of the Investments & Wealth Institute. And yet, even though saving and paying for college continues to be a top priority for most families, many still make suboptimal decisions that put other goals at risk, such as saving enough for their own retirement, Riskin said in a recent episode of Decoding Retirement (see video above or listen below). Riskin discussed the benefits of families saving early for future education expenses and making sure all family members understand their roles. For instance, if grandparents or aunts and uncles plan on helping out, it is best to capture that information early on to create an optimal and efficient funding plan, he noted. “We need to know who's actually going to be involved in the funding process,” he said. “Understanding that early on helps us build a more accurate plan of how much we actually need to save.” Talking to family members about contributing to education costs might seem challenging, at least on paper. However, according to Riskin, the actual difficulty of the conversation “depends on everybody’s education funding philosophy and, really, college funding philosophy.” Time horizon plays a key role in helping parents choose the most suitable education savings options, such as 529 plans and Coverdell education savings accounts, among others. A 529 is a tax-advantaged savings account specifically designed to help individuals save for education expenses, whereas a Coverdell account is a trust or custodial account designed for paying a beneficiary's qualified education expenses. According to Riskin, households should consider four main factors when evaluating these vehicles and their underlying investment options. The first two criteria are operational flexibility and investment flexibility. Operational flexibility refers to how the account is opened and managed, how funds are added or withdrawn, the ability to change account owners or beneficiaries, and overall ease of operation. Investment flexibility, meanwhile, considers how much money can be contributed, what types of investments are available, any limitations on changing investment allocations, and how frequently adjustments can be made. For instance, 529 plans may have limited investment options and restrict changes to twice per year. The next factor to consider is tax efficiency, which involves understanding any tax benefits or other implications when contributing or withdrawing funds from an account. Some accounts, like 529s and Coverdells, offer tax advantages that other options may not. Read more: How do education tax credits work and who qualifies? Lastly, families should consider financial aid efficiency, or how the account affects financial aid eligibility. Some accounts can be treated as an asset for aid calculations and certain withdrawals may count as income, which can negatively impact aid. Who owns the account — whether it be a parent, student, or other family member — also influences this factor. Riskin generally favors 529 plans due to their advantages across the four key criteria. However, individuals who want a wider range of investment choices might find Coverdell ESAs or taxable brokerage accounts to be more suitable options. In other cases, it might be appropriate to consider saving for college costs using a custodial account, often referred to as Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA) and Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) accounts. Such accounts make it easy to give financial gifts to a child without the cost of setting up a trust. However, the account must be transferred to the child once they reach a certain age and could reduce college financial aid eligibility. Given that there’s no one ideal education savings vehicle, Riskin suggested exploring all options. “It really is this puzzle that you’re trying to put together,” he said, noting that he’s a big fan of using multiple savings accounts. “I’m not an all-or-nothing [person]. I’m not putting everything into [a] 529 or putting everything into a brokerage account. … You want to have flexibility.” Riskin also highlighted the importance of filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA), even for families who don’t expect to qualify for aid. He noted that the FAFSA is required to access federal student loans — which may be eligible for forgiveness — along with work-study programs. And some schools, he said, even require it to consider students for merit-based scholarships, regardless of financial need. Additionally, with rising college costs, families who previously assumed they earned too much may now qualify for need-based aid at higher-cost schools. Looking ahead, Riskin also suggested that some education-related policies may remain stable while others face uncertainty under the incoming Trump administration. Riskin expects the policy allowing 529 funds for K-12 tuition (up to $10,000 per year currently) to remain in place and potentially expand — a move that would reflect the Trump administration’s support for private education options. However, one of the income-driven repayment plans, the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, as well as the tax-free income status of loan forgiveness plans might be at risk. In July, a federal court issued an injunction blocking the implementation of certain aspects of the SAVE Plan and other IDR plans. At present, public service loan forgiveness is tax-free, but forgiveness under IDR plans may be taxable after 2025 unless Congress extends the current tax exemption, which Riskin believes is unlikely. Read more: Will I be taxed on student loan forgiveness? There are other implications for colleges as well. Changes to immigration policies could reduce the number of international students in the US, which could financially strain colleges that rely on their tuition. This may lead to increased tuition costs or budget cuts in other areas. Ultimately, Riskin advised against making sudden moves, like paying off student loans immediately, and recommended waiting to see how policies evolve, as federal loans offer flexibility and potential forgiveness options that private loans may not.

167,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tesla-stock-jumps-on-report-trump-could-ease-self-driving-regulations-183853598.html,"Mon, Nov 18, 2024, 1:01 PM"," Tesla (TSLA) stock jumped on Monday as more news rolls in indicating that CEO Elon Musk’s bet on President-elect Donald Trump is paying off. Bloomberg News reported Trump’s transition team has told advisers it plans to make a “federal framework” for full self-driving (FSD) or autonomous vehicles one of the Transportation Department’s priorities, according to people familiar with the matter. Easing rules for the introduction of self-driving vehicles, especially those without pedals or steering wheels, would be a huge boon for Tesla. Musk has repeatedly said that the future of the company hinges on FSD and autonomous technologies. Tesla stock closed up 5.6% on Monday, and is up over 40% since Election Day (Nov. 5). Current federal rules by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) have eased somewhat recently in regard to autonomous vehicles. However, the rules still dictate that an occupant must be able to operate a ""steering control"" mechanism to manually control the vehicle if need be. While the NHTSA does allow companies to petition for allowances or changes for testing purposes, those are hard to come by. GM’s Cruise recently abandoned its Origin autonomous vehicle that uses a steering wheel and pedals due to regulatory uncertainty; Cruise is using Chevrolet Bolt EVs with manual controls in its autonomous drives. Though the NHTSA and the Department of Transportation can issue rules and regulations to ease driverless driving requirements like physical controls, Bloomberg reported that Congress could step in with “a bipartisan legislative measure being discussed in early stages” that would create federal rules around EVs, per two separate sources. An act of Congress could preempt current rules by the NHTSA and the DOT and could also be used by state and local governments to develop their own self-driving regulations. Congress and the federal government could also force local governments to use federal rules by threatening to pull highway and infrastructure spending if they aren’t followed. New federal rules easing autonomous driving and requirements would be a huge win for Tesla and Musk. Last month, at a glitzy event at the Warner Bros.. studio lot, Musk showcased Tesla’s upcoming Cybercab robotaxi and autonomous van concept, vehicles that do not include physical driver controls like a steering wheel or pedals. Musk said the company has already begun testing its Cybercab, with a potential debut coming in 2026. “Musk's significant influence in the Trump White House is already having a major influence and ultimately the golden path for Tesla around Cybercabs and autonomous is now within reach with an emboldened Trump/Musk strategic alliance playing out in real time and very in line with our thesis,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note to investors Monday morning. Ives and Wedbush predict Tesla’s AI and autonomous business could be worth $1 trillion alone, and the expectation is for a Trump White House to fast-track FSD and robotaxi initiatives, meaning the “federal regulatory spiderweb” Tesla encountered over the past few years could be cleared.

168,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-trump-biden-stock-market-rally-decoded-133100164.html,"Sun, Nov 17, 2024, 5:31 AM"," This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with: The chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings I had three personal goals going into this year's Yahoo Finance Invest conference. Goal one was to ensure all the passionate Yahoo Finance fans in the audience came away more knowledgeable about investing than when they arrived. Considering the event was standing room only the entire day and notepads were out, I think mission accomplished here. The next goal was to cheer on the Yahoo Finance team of journalists interviewing titans of industry, as well as the incredible teams behind the scenes making the event come to life. I lost my voice a little the day after (which you could probably hear in the above Opening Bid podcast from the next day), so mission accomplished here too. And goal three —- wait for it — was to figure out why on earth movers and shakers in the world of business were so darn jazzed by another Trump presidency. Why were they hitting the buy button on stocks that were already near records pre-Election Day? Why were they more bullish on the business of doing business today compared to outgoing president Joe Biden? The president-elect has floated all sorts of potentially economically damaging policies, from stiff tariffs on China that run the risk of reigniting inflation to mass deportations that could severely upset supply chains. The market moves we've seen since Nov. 5 border on nonsensical, especially in the wake of the interesting cast of characters being put forward by Trump to run key government agencies. In the end, I got the answer to my question in two of my interviews: Apollo (APO) co-founder and CEO Marc Rowan (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management) and Bank of America (BAC) chairman and CEO Brian Moynihan. And the answer is this: The market has reasoned the billions of dollars the Biden administration pumped into the economy in areas such as infrastructure — which is only hitting now in a lot of cases — will be super-charged by looser regulations by Trump. This, in effect, could be coined the Trumpian-Biden rally. So the play appears to be buying possibly stronger-than-expected cash flows of companies today before the growth mushroom cloud appears down the line. A few important comments: Marc Rowan ""Look, this administration is coming in at a point in time where they really have an opportunity to pivot. Think about where the US is in the world. I mean, all the action is here. I mean, just recite what's going on. The economy is in great shape, certainly relative to the other two large blocs of Europe and China. We have stimulated our economy over the past four years, and we're about to get the dividend of that. I mean, we forget, three years ago, we passed almost $2 trillion for infrastructure. It's all under construction. Two years ago, $52 billion for semiconductor plants. Not a single plant is open yet, all under construction. Three years in a row, we've been the largest recipient of foreign direct investment, all under construction. It's coming our way. We're where the action is. And now the question is, can we lead? And you can pick almost any area, pick energy. We've spent all this time where the dialogue's been about energy transition. I think we're actually going to start talking about energy accretion. I mean, think of just the demand for data, for power, for data to help redefine our future. We can't just talk about transition anymore. We have to acknowledge we are going to need more power. No one produces clean power the way we produce it."" Brian Moynihan ""I think what's really driving the fundamental activity in the economy is the things that make America great. Capitalism. A consumer is employed and earning money and spending, and credit is widely available. Those are what drives this capital market, and investors like all the people here [at Invest] are putting [capital] to work. And that's what makes America great. And having a set of policies to enhance that is a good thing."" I guess what can go wrong? Let me tell you, a lot can go wrong. The path toward turbocharged growth over the next four years won't be straight — and could look ugly before it gets better.

169,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/how-robert-f-kennedy-jr-could-impact-the-healthcare-sector-as-secretary-of-health-182748442.html,"Mon, Nov 18, 2024, 11:27 AM"," President-elect Donald Trump's nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to lead the nation’s top health agency sent healthcare stocks sliding last week. Vaccine makers like Moderna (MRNA) were down more than 5%, while larger companies like Pfizer PFE (PFE) were down about 2%. Some Wall Street analysts said the slide was an overreaction and that it's too early to tell if or how much Kennedy could impact the healthcare sector since little is known about the controversial pick's actual policies and he has yet to be confirmed by the US Senate. If confirmed as secretary of Health and Human Services, Kennedy would oversee the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). JPMorgan healthcare analyst Chris Schott said in a note to clients that the sector is facing “a period of max uncertainty” until the Cabinet position is filled and more is known about Kennedy. But, Schott added, it also means that the large-cap stocks, as a whole, are currently trading at a 35% discount to the S&P 500, leaving room for future upside rather than more downside trading. Mizuho’s healthcare sector expert Jared Holz said in a note to clients that he agrees with some of the big-picture issues Kennedy has identified, such as America's obesity epidemic and the dangers of ultra-processed foods. “The country should be much healthier than it is and there is a ton of room for improvement, including nutrition, food production, consumption, etc. This is a very complicated topic and always has been,” Holz said. Here's some of what we do know about Kennedy's views on major healthcare topics. Vaccines: Known as an anti-vaxxer, Kennedy has questioned the need to vaccinate children and refused to get a COVID-19 vaccine, concerning some Wall Street analysts about his possible effect on the vaccine industry and how he could influence the childhood vaccine schedule, as well as the regulatory process to test and approve vaccines and other treatments. There is also speculation he and Trump’s government efficiency appointees, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, could gut the FDA. Vaccine stocks were hurt the most on the news of Kennedy's nomination, despite him previously saying he wasn’t “taking away” anybody’s vaccines. GLP-1s: RFK has said he doesn’t believe the weekly injectables are the solution to the country’s obesity problem. It is unclear if he could derail current efforts by GLP-1 makers to gain Medicare coverage, which is currently not allowed for obesity. Companies are studying the drugs' impacts on obesity-related diseases such as heart disease and sleep apnea, which are covered by Medicare and would therefore open up federal dollars for purchase. A recent report showed Medicaid, which would also be under Kennedy's purview, has contributed significantly to sales of the injectables compared to employer-sponsored and commercial insurance plans. Some analysts fear Kennedy's positions could limit access to the drugs and levels of coverage, potentially impacting the fortunes of market leaders Eli Lilly (LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NVO). Holz, however, said he “still believes GLP-1s will be the largest therapeutic category by a wide margin despite some comments from RFK noting that Americans should use other non-drug methods in order to lose weight.” Drug pricing: With oversight of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Kennedy would have a chance to negotiate more or less aggressively with pharmaceutical companies than the Biden administration. That is, of course, if the Trump administration chooses to continue exercising the new powers established by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). ""President Trump will still be focused on this issue and could seek to 'get a better deal' via IRA negotiations than the Biden administration,"" Leerink Partners said in a note. Food regulations: Kennedy has been vocal about prioritizing the regulation of ultra-processed foods. Studies show these foods are contributing to obesity in the country. It's a policy the current FDA commissioner, Robert Califf, has already spoken about, and the agency has been looking to issue new rules on labeling, as well as better research on the impacts of these foods. While of more concern to food stocks than healthcare, the issue is related to his stance on obesity and GLP-1s. It is unclear how Kennedy would tackle this issue.

Stocks have surged since the election, while bonds are caught in a tug-of-war between bulls and bears, with participants in both markets attempting to divine the path of the US economy under the incoming Trump administration. At the heart of the matter lies a hotly debated topic that grips Fed economists and Wall Street alike. Something that, like the mythical yeti, no one has ever seen but everyone agrees exists: the neutral rate. Kathy Jones, chief fixed income strategist at Schwab, recently joined Yahoo Finance's Stocks in Translation podcast and described the neutral rate as ""the Sasquatch of the financial world."" The neutral rate is simple enough to define. It's the interest rate that neither stimulates nor slows the economy. It's the sweet spot where growth and inflation sit in balance. Too low, and the economy might overheat; too high, and growth stalls. The problem is no one really knows precisely what level of interest rates meets this high standard. ""You model its inputs by looking at the past,"" said Jones. ""Things like productivity might go into it."" She noted that if workers can boost their productivity and increase their output, the economy can grow — critically, without inflation. Minneapolis Fed president Neel Kashkari echoed this recently at the Yahoo Finance Invest 2024 event, explaining, “In a higher productivity environment, the neutral rate ought to be higher.” He said that if productivity is structurally higher, the Fed has less room to cut until the economy gets back to neutral. Nevertheless, this nebulous rate is critical in shaping Federal Reserve policy. At Invest, Kashkari echoed Fed Chair Jerome Powell's words at the September FOMC presser, saying, ""The neutral rate is not directly observable. We know it by its effect on the economy."" With the Fed currently in the process of lowering rates, a higher neutral rate implies the Fed doesn't need to cut rates as much to support the economy. Alternatively, a lower neutral rate would argue for more aggressive cuts. Lately, investors have been coming around to the idea of a higher neutral rate. When the Fed began its rate-cutting cycle in September, investors expected the Fed to cut short-term rates to 2.8% — or a range of 2.75% to 3% — by the end of 2025. Six weeks later, the bond market is now pricing in four fewer rate cuts — bringing the projected rate next year to a range of 3.75%-4%. Fortunately, Jay Powell and the Fed currently appear to have some breathing room. In a speech Wednesday at the Dallas Regional Chamber, Powell stated, ""The economy is not sending any signals that we need to be in a hurry to lower rates."" For her part, Jones prefers to pore over actual data rather than model it with theoretical projections. ""We see what we observe in the real data,"" Jones said, ""and we go from there.""

171,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-isnt-panicking-with-known-entity-jay-clayton-as-new-top-cop-130918574.html,"Tue, Nov 19, 2024, 5:09 AM"," President-elect Donald Trump’s choice of former SEC boss Jay Clayton to lead an office of prosecutors with a history of pursuing financial crimes is notable for its complete lack of controversy — especially on Wall Street. The announcement that Clayton would serve as US Attorney for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) came amid a string of other Trump nominations that attracted considerably more attention for their breaking of norms, including Matt Gaetz as attorney general and Pete Hegseth as defense department secretary. Clayton, on the other hand, is a ""well-respected, known entity,"" said white-collar criminal defense attorney and former federal prosecutor Michael Weinstein. After he ran the Securities and Exchange Commission from 2017 to 2020, Clayton returned to the New York white-shoe law firm Sullivan & Cromwell, where he currently advises on financial regulations and government investigations. He also serves on the board of the giant private equity firm Apollo Global Management. (Disclosure: Yahoo Finance is owned by Apollo Global Management). Clayton was ""considered somewhat pro-Wall Street"" during his time at the SEC and ""had a good reputation coming out of that role,"" said former federal prosecutor William Devaney, chair of Baker McKenzie's North American litigation and government enforcement group. Trump ""didn’t put in his own political guy, at least,"" added Weinstein, who noted that Clayton’s experience at the SEC and as a litigation attorney should help streamline the financial cases that make up the bread and butter of SDNY’s work. Not that Clayton doesn’t have some work to do if he gets confirmed by the US Senate to the post. He lacks criminal prosecution experience, which, to Weinstein, creates ""a real blind spot"" for the jurisdiction that will need to be overcome with help from experienced deputies. And he is also not free from all political controversy surrounding moves made by Trump in the past. He landed in the spotlight during Trump’s first term in office in the summer of 2020 when he was first floated for the SDNY post during a White House shake-up. In June of that year, Trump’s US Attorney General Bill Barr wrote in a letter to Trump-appointed SDNY chief Geoffrey Berman that he wanted Berman to resign so that he could be replaced by Clayton. Berman refused, and Trump made a controversial move, firing him. At the time, Berman had already prosecuted defendants with ties to Trump, including associates of Trump’s lawyer Rudy Giuliani, Lev Parnas, and Igor Fruman, who were convicted on campaign finance contribution violations. Clayton told lawmakers in public testimony that summer that he was ""fully committed"" to his work at the SEC and ultimately didn’t take the position. His political skills could be tested again if confirmed for the SDNY post. Trump, who was convicted of 34 felonies this year in a New York State Supreme Court case, has vowed retribution on those who prosecuted him. The case was prosecuted by Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg. “The question will be how much autonomy he or any US Attorney will have in the Trump Justice Department,” said Baker McKenzie's Devaney. Clayton would join an office that has for decades pursued cases involving Wall Street wrongdoing, organized crime, drug rings, political corruption, and terrorism. Its most high-profile cases in recent years include the prosecution of FTX cryptocurrency exchange founder Sam Bankman-Fried, US Senator Bob Menendez, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, and hip-hop mogul Sean ""Diddy"" Combs. During his time as SEC chair, Clayton initiated more than 2,800 enforcement actions and assessed $15 billion in financial remedies. The SEC returned $3.5 billion to harmed investors and paid more than $580 million in whistleblower rewards. Just before leaving the SEC in December 2020, Clayton launched a first-of-its-kind lawsuit against enterprise software company Ripple, the company that created the digital currency XRP (XRP-USD). In the case, the SEC alleged that the cryptocurrency had been illegally sold as an unregistered security. The commission later dropped the charges in favor of pursuing a remedy to address the SEC’s concerns. Before Clayton left the SEC he also tangled with Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, an adviser to Trump on the campaign trail who this month was tapped to curtail government spending in the new administration. Musk and the SEC in 2018 agreed to a deal to resolve securities fraud charges against the billionaire after Musk posted to social media platform X that he had ""funding secured"" for a buyout of the electric-car company at $420 a share. Musk stepped aside as chairman for three years and agreed to a $20 million fine. Trump, in his announcement on Truth Social, called Clayton ""a highly respected business leader, counsel and public servant.""

172,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stellantis-reveals-multi-energy-ev-truck-platform-thats-well-positioned-for-the-market-ceo-says-181507112.html,"Tue, Nov 19, 2024, 10:15 AM"," Stellantis (STLA) revealed new details for its upcoming truck EV platform as the Big Three automaker attempts to revamp its flagging business. Stellantis — which counts Dodge, Ram, Jeep, and Fiat among its brands— will use the “STLA Frame” platform for its pickups and large SUVs that use electrified powertrains. The “body on frame” STLA Frame platform differs from the automaker’s other EV platforms (small, medium, large), which use traditional unibody construction. The STLA Frame is designed for full-size, body-on-frame trucks and SUVs, with the ability to support multi-energy solutions, mainly for battery electric (BEV) and range-extender electric vehicle (REEV) technologies, but also internal combustion, hybrid, and even hydrogen if needed. Stellantis — as opposed to GM (GM) and Ford (F) — is using a multi-energy platform for its trucks to meet its customers where they are, CEO Carlos Tavares said in a call with reporters. ""If you ask me if I would prefer a faster [EV] transition, I would say yes, I would prefer that. But we are not here to follow my 'guesstimations,' we are here to adapt to the market conditions and make the customers happy,"" Tavares said. Stellantis said the Frame platform will use dual electric drive motors (EDMs) for all-wheel drive capability and is targeting 500 miles of all-electric range for the BEV. The range-extender EV, which uses a gas-powered motor as a generator to charge the battery when it's depleted, will have an even larger range of 690 miles. Both the EV and the range-extender EV will have a 2,700-pound payload and 14,000-pound towing capacity. Ram and Jeep vehicles will be the first to use the STLA frame vehicle; Stellantis has already unveiled the new Ram 1500 REV EV pickup and Ramcharger range-extender pickup. While a Jeep EV using the STLA frame has not been announced, it's rumored that it will be a Wagoneer or Grand Wagoneer SUV variant. Tavares said the pickups would be on dealer lots in the first half of 2025, meaning the company missed its late 2024 deadline for the trucks. ""We don't want to take risks in terms of validation; it's very important for Stellantis to demonstrate that we have all the capabilities and that we master the technology with a high level of durability, and that's exactly what we are doing right now,"" Tavares said. The announcement for Stellantis’s latest EV platform comes at a difficult time for the automaker. Last month, Stellantis reported disappointing third quarter revenue and shipments and had earlier warned that profits would be significantly lower for the year compared to 2023 due to bloated inventory and deterioration in its US and China businesses. “We’re grinding through a transition here,” CFO Doug Ostermann said on the earnings call. Ostermann, who only just replaced outgoing CFO Natalie Knight in mid-October, is another new face at Stellantis. The automaker also said that CEO Carlos Tavares would be retiring after his contract ends in 2026 and that Jeep CEO Antonio Filosa will be adding North America COO to his duties, succeeding exec Carlos Zarlenga. Stellantis also said this month it would lay off 1,100 workers at its Jeep Gladiator plant in Ohio due to a sales decline for the off-road pickup, though an electrified hybrid version of the Gladiator is coming next year. The election of Donald Trump and his transition team’s stance on EVs may also be a headwind for Stellantis and other automakers betting on EVs. The Trump team is reportedly planning to eliminate the federal $7,500 tax credit for EVs when the new administration comes into power next year. Tavares believes Stellantis can still thrive because it has a nimble strategy in place. ""Let's recognize that with a multi-energy platform strategy, we are well positioned to adapt to very different market circumstances, and we could say regulatory circumstances, or any change,"" Tavares said when asked about Trump and the threat of losing government incentives.

174,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nomura-expects-fed-pause-rate-092146893.html,"Mon, Nov 18, 2024, 1:21 AM"," By Siddarth S (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve is no longer expected to cut interest rates at its December policy meeting, Nomura has said, making it the first global brokerage to signal a pause in the central bank's rate-cutting cycle in the wake of Donald Trump's election win. Nomura now expects the Fed to deliver only two 25-basis-point (bp) rate reductions at its March and June meetings in 2025, leaving the brokerage's Fed funds rate projection unchanged at 4.125% through next year. The Fed's benchmark overnight interest rate is currently in the 4.50%-4.75% range. It has cut rates by 75 bps in 2024. Other global brokerages, including Goldman Sachs and J.P.Morgan, anticipate a 25-bp cut from the central bank next month. Nomura expects the Fed to halt its tightening cycle next month after recent hawkish remarks from policymakers amid ongoing economic growth and the likelihood of further elevated inflation, adding to the central bank's indication that it is not in a hurry to lower rates. This follows the Fed's increasing hesitancy to cut rates as a major political shift is underway after Trump's presidential victory. Wall Street is trying to reconcile what it sees as further inflationary pressures in the coming year as the President-elect pushes for tax cuts, higher tariffs and a crackdown on immigration.

Each year, changes to the Medicare Part B premium, deductible, and copays are determined based on stipulations of the Social Security Act, according to a news release from CMS. In 2025, the standard monthly premium for Medicare Part B will increase to $185, an increase of $10.30 per month from $174.70 in 2024, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) announced on November 8. Approximately 8% of Medicare Part B beneficiaries will pay more than the standard premium as high earners, according to CMS. In 2025, Part B beneficiaries with annual individual incomes greater than $106,000 will pay more than the standard premium, which will vary depending on their income. The annual deductible for all Medicare Part B beneficiaries will increase to $257 in 2025, or an additional $17 from the 2024 annual deductible of $240. The increase for the 2025 Part B standard premium and deductible “is mainly due to projected price changes and assumed utilization increases that are consistent with historical experience,” according to the same news release. Most Medicare Part B premiums are deducted automatically from Social Security benefit payments. The 2025 increase in Medicare premiums outpaces inflation, which rose to an annual rate of 3.2% in October, and the increase in Social Security benefits of 2.5%, or approximately $50 per month starting in January. CMS also announced increases to Medicare Part A pricing in 2025. Medicare Part A covers hospital stays, and at times covers home health care, skilled facility care, and hospice care. While 99% of Medicare Part A beneficiaries pay no premium (if they meet the requirements of having at least 40 quarters of Medicare-covered employment), deductibles and copays still apply. These are the 2025 Medicare Part A pricing changes: The inpatient hospital deductible will be $1,676 in 2025, an increase of $44 from $1,632 in 2024. The deductible covers the beneficiaries’ portion of costs for the first 60 days of Medicare-covered inpatient hospital care during the benefit period. The copay for the 61st through 90th day of hospitalization will be $419 per day ($408 in 2024) during a benefit period, and $838 per day for lifetime reserve days ($816 in 2024). The daily copay for days 21 through 100 of extended care services in a benefit period in skilled nursing facilities will be $209.50 in 2025 ($204.00 in 2024). For the 1% of Part A beneficiaries who pay the full premium, the amount will be $518 a month in 2025, a $13 increase from 2024. CMS also announced that similar to Part B, high-income individuals will pay more for Medicare Part D (prescription drug coverage) monthly premiums in 2025. Beneficiaries who file individual tax returns with modified adjusted gross income of $106,000 or higher will pay an additional $13.70 to $85.80 monthly, depending on their income. Beneficiaries who are married and lived with their spouses at any time during the year, but file separate tax returns from their spouses with modified adjusted gross income, with incomes of $106,000 or higher will pay an additional $78.60 to $85.80 per month, depending on their income.

Elsewhere, the European Commission sees a gradual firming in euro-area economic growth next year. China’s trade surplus is on pace to hit a record this year, highlighting its continued reliance on exports to compensate for weak domestic demand. Here are some of the charts that appeared on Bloomberg this week on the latest developments in the global economy, markets and geopolitics: US The so-called core consumer price index — which excludes food and energy costs — increased 0.3% for a third month. Over the last three months it rose at a 3.6% annualized rate, marking the fastest pace since April, according to Bloomberg calculations. Economists see the core gauge as a better indicator of the inflation trend than the overall CPI. Retail sales advanced in October, boosted by a jump in autos purchases, while other categories signaled some momentum heading into the holiday season. Categories were mixed, but the upward revision to September sales suggests consumers entered the final months of the year on a stronger footing than previously thought. US household debt climbed to a fresh high last quarter, with rising incomes leaving many consumers able to manage the burden, but lower-income groups showing signs of financial strain. Europe The euro area’s economic growth will pick up as obstacles to consumption and investment fade away, though geopolitics poses an increasing threat, according to the European Commission. Gross domestic product will increase by 1.3% next year and by 1.6% in 2026, the EU’s executive arm said. Germany’s economy will hardly grow next year as underlying problems add to cyclical weakness, according to Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s independent panel of experts. Surveys point to poor sentiment, particularly after the election of Donald Trump in the US and the collapse of Germany’s government. Company insolvencies are surging in the UK after the Labour government reduced tax breaks and increased levies for owners. Asia China’s trade surplus is on track to hit a fresh record this year, increasingly leaving it on a collision course with some of the world’s biggest economies by aggravating an imbalance in global commerce. India’s trade deficit widened significantly in October as imports climbed during the Hindu festival season, even though exports posted robust growth. Emerging Markets Argentine President Javier Milei foreshadowed Tuesday he would change his currency policy after the end of the year if inflation stays constant in November and December. Milei said he would slow the monthly pace of currency devaluation that the central bank controls, known as the crawling peg, to 1% from 2% if price increases stay at or below October’s 2.7% reading. Russians are facing a surge in food prices, creating a headache for President Vladimir Putin as he tries to balance the Kremlin’s military ambitions with a need for domestic stability. A boom in Brazil’s agriculture sector sparked a rush of investments, with the $7 billion market for agribusiness funds luring people from all walks of life in the past three years. But with bumper crops across the globe sending prices plunging and Brazilian farmers filing for bankruptcy at alarming rates, the retail investor is paying the price. World China has made a $1.3 billion bet that a new port in Peru will boost access to South America’s agricultural bounty. Chancay port, about 44 miles north of Lima, is majority-owned and operated by China’s Cosco Shipping. While the facility promises to slash travel times for cargo going between China and South America, significant hurdles threaten to diminish its success — especially when it comes to getting goods from Brazil.

A panel of three judges at the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans heard separate oral arguments in the SpaceX and Amazon lawsuits, which the two companies initiated after the labor agency filed complaints against them in disputes about workers’ rights and union organizing. A ruling in favor of the companies could immensely diminish – or paralyze - the nearly century-old agency, which is tasked with enforcing labor laws and settling labor-related complaints workers lodge against their employers. The issue may eventually reach the U.S. Supreme Court, which has a conservative majority and has issued rulings curbing the power of government agencies, The three appellate judges who heard Monday's arguments questioned the legal maneuvering by Amazon and SpaceX to get their cases to the 5th Circuit, where jurists nominated by Republican presidents dominate the appeals court. A lawyer for the NLRB emphasized during the hearing that both companies filed their appeals after lower courts did not give rulings by requested deadlines. Michael E. Kenneally, an attorney for SpaceX, retorted that the government was “relying so much on the procedural objections” because of the alleged weakness of its legal argument, a claim that elicited some pushback from the panel. “That sounds to me like the argument ‘procedure doesn’t matter if I win on the merits,’” Judge James E. Graves Jr., an appointee of former President Barack Obama, said. SpaceX, Musk's space technology company, filed its lawsuit against the NLRB in January after the labor agency accused the company of unlawfully firing employees who wrote an open letter critical of Musk and of creating the impression worker activities were being surveilled. Among other claims, the company argued in its complaint that agency proceedings deprived it of the right to a trial by a jury. Musk, the world’s richest person, has become more influential in the past few months after pumping an estimated $200 million through his political action committee to help elect Donald Trump as president. After he was elected, Trump tapped Musk and former GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy to lead a new efficiency commission focused on cutting costs across the federal government. Musk has said the new administration will have a “mandate to delete the mountain of choking regulations that do not serve the greater good.” Amazon's lawsuit against the NLRB is tied to the company’s objections to a union election that took place at a warehouse in New York City in April 2022. The retail giant has accused the agency of improperly interfering in that election, partly by bringing a lawsuit against the company to reinstate a fired organizer close to when voting began. The Amazon Labor Union ultimately won the election to represent workers, but Amazon has refused to come to the negotiating table. The company’s attorneys argued in the lawsuit that the NLRB board members who authorized the agency’s complaint later “acted as judges” by denying a review of Amazon's objections, which also came before them. Amazon's lawyers maintained the agency’s structure was unconstitutional because board members are shielded from removal by the U.S. president, among other things. In a statement issued before Monday's hearing, NLRB General Counsel Jennifer Abruzzo said it was “nothing new for big companies to challenge the authority of the NLRB to enforce workers’ rights so as not to be held accountable for their violations"" of labor law."," Attorneys Amazon and Elon Musk’s SpaceX in a federal appeals court Monday that the Labor Relations Board’s structure is unconstitutional, advancing a legal fight that may last into the Trump administration where Musk expected to oversee bureaucratic cost-cutting.

Like Monday, there's little news to guide market direction, with a reversal of some of the big moves from last week when world stocks suffered their worst week since the start of September again being the main driver of moves. The U.S. dollar is trading on the back foot again today, extending its retreat from a one-year peak versus major peers from last week. Treasury yields sagged to new lows in Tokyo, pulling away from Friday's high above 4.5%, a level last seen 5-1/2-months ago. The outlook for Federal Reserve easing seems to have returned as the market's main preoccupation, in the absence of highly anticipated announcements of Donald Trump's picks for the Treasury and trade portfolios. A run of robust U.S. data combined with expectations of faster inflation under Trump's higher-tariff, tighter-immigration policies have seen bets for a December rate cut pared to around 58% on CME FedWatch, from greater than 65% odds a week ago. Despite the relative news vacuum, AI darling Nvidia's earnings on Wednesday loom large as the event likely to set the tone for equity markets at least for the final half of the week, and possibly into year-end. There's little on the data docket in Europe today, which is headlined by final consumer inflation readings for October for the euro zone as a whole. Similarly, the U.S. only has housing figures on tap. There are plenty of central bank speakers though, including Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid late in the day. Ahead of that, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey and his peers appear in parliament, where they are likely to be peppered with questions about the implications of the government's big-spending budget and Trump's potential trade policies. ECB policy maker Frank Elderson also gives remarks at a green finance forum in Frankfurt. And in Sweden, Riksbank's First Deputy Governor Anna Breman takes the podium. Key developments that could influence markets on Tuesday: -BoE officials speak in parliament -Euro zone final HICP (Oct) -ECB's Elderson speaks -Riksbank's Breman speaks -Kansas City Fed's Schmid speaks (Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)"," A at day ahead in European and global markets from Buckland Signs are positive European stocks' open, with futures pointing up, and equity indices across most of Asia also in the green.

Most Read from Bloomberg Saudi Neom Gets $3 Billion Loan Guarantee From Italy Export Credit Agency Sace The Urban-Rural Divide Over Highway Expansion and Emissions The 82-year-old founder of Hin Leong Trading Pte., who has appeared for court hearings in a wheelchair, faced three out of more than 100 charges initially presented. Lim and his children had already agreed in September to pay $3.6 billion to the company’s liquidators and creditor HSBC in a separate, civil, case, and have filed for bankruptcy. Judge Toh Han Li said at Singapore’s State Courts on Monday that the case involved some of the most serious cheating offenses seen in the country to date. A “deterrent” sentence was justified, he said, adding there would be no major concessions for Lim’s medical condition. A Mandarin speaker with limited English, Lim listened to the sentencing through a translator. His lawyer Davinder Singh, a top litigator whose clients have included the nation’s first prime minister, Lee Kuan Yew, has appealed on behalf of his client. Lim will not begin to serve his sentence until after the appeal hearing. OK Lim, as he is widely known, built up his company from a one-truck operation into a family-held powerhouse. Traders, analysts and lawyers interviewed by Bloomberg described a young immigrant whose grit and business acumen were as notable as his iron fist in the early years, expanding along with the country’s profile as a commodity trading hub. Hin Leong, at its peak, traded a range of oil products, made lubricants and operated loading terminals and storage facilities. Its affiliate had a fleet of more than 100 ships transporting fuel across the world. But when Lim’s downfall came in 2020, as Covid—19 sent oil prices into freefall, it was swift. A bad bet that China’s swift containment of the coronavirus would turn the crude market around exposed $800 million of hidden futures losses. Other practices later uncovered included using single cargoes to obtain multiple loans. While the company’s official paperwork pointed to an annual profit, it had in reality been operating in the red for years, he said at the time. It was a shocking demise for the industry and for Singapore, still recovering from other trading and accounting scandals including Noble Group Ltd, Agritrade International Pte., ZenRock Commodities Trading Pte. and Hontop Energy (Singapore) Pte. Ltd., that threatened the nation’s squeaky-clean reputation. Risk Taker Born in China’s Fujian province, Lim started as a small wholesaler of fuel to local transport companies and fishing boats. He would go on to leverage his strength in logistics to build a regional distribution network serving frontier Asian markets such as Vietnam and later, Myanmar. Interviews with those who knew Lim at his peak, most of whom declined to be named given the sensitivity of the topic, paint a picture of a low-key figure, with a rags-to-riches path that led to wealth he generally preferred not to flaunt. In his own testimony, he described his upbringing as the son of a fisherman, working odd jobs to make ends meet before joining the suppliers that sold fuel for the family boat. But the oil trading heavyweight was also a keen poker player and risk taker, and he made the most of the opacity of the oil trading world. His trades, bold and aggressive, became legendary. “OK Lim was a pioneer in Singapore and Asia’s oil-trading industry, and a success story,” said John Driscoll, a veteran Singapore-based trader who traded alongside Lim in the 1990s and 2000s. “While he has to face up to his wrongdoings and the collapse of his company, it doesn’t take away from the man’s legacy and the rags-to-riches story of what was once the country’s leading oil merchant.” Hin Leong got its break in the 1990s, when Lim and his son, Evan Lim, began participating in a trading and price assessment platform run by what’s now known as S&P Global. As part of this mechanism, market players submit bids and offers for small parcels of oil that will go into determining the cost of fuel at hubs such as Singapore. They also provide physical deliveries for transactions on the so-called market-on-close (MOC) window. Before long, Hin Leong became an active player, dominating regional diesel and fuel oil markets as his company expanded to include the ownership of onshore storage tanks and a fleet of tankers doubling up as floating storage, from which large volumes could be delivered. As China expanded and ships stopped in Singapore for fuel, Hin Leong was there to supply it. The hidden losses and ultimate collapse of the company, first reported by Bloomberg in 2020, brought all of that to a halt. He was convicted in May this year and has since presented himself as a much-diminished figure. OK Lim and his family’s assets, including some of Singapore’s most valuable houses in prestigious districts, have been up for sale. Proceeds will go to the judicial managers of Hin Leong.

He is scheduled to be sentenced on March 19. Prosecutors charged Thompson this month with making about $771,678 in profit from 69 illegal trades in more than seven financial institutions. The banks weren’t identified by prosecutors, but a separate US Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit filed Nov. 8 against Thompson identified at least two of them as New York Community Bancorp and Capital One Financial Corp. Thompson, who worked at the regulator for two decades, recently managed a team that supervised and conducted exams of US banks with at least $100 billion in assets, excluding the eight largest, according to the SEC. In his role, he was prohibited from trading shares of banks and was required to disclose every year any conflicts of interest or bank holdings. The Federal Reserve has come under scrutiny for trading by officials, including two former policymakers who were cleared of wrongdoing earlier this year following an internal probe into trades they made in 2020. The Fed has since imposed new rules that bar top officials from purchasing individual stocks and bonds, limited trading and required the sale of certain assets before joining the regulator. Thompson had regular access to confidential information about banks, including unreleased earnings data; capital, liquidity, and risk levels; and records of bank examinations, stress tests, and other regulatory events, according to the SEC complaint. In October 2023, Thompson received an email from a Fed colleague revealing Capital One would report earnings exceeding analysts’ estimates, according to the SEC. Thompson purchased shares hours before the earnings release and made about $79,346 in profit when the shares rose after the results were made public, according to the lawsuit. In January, Thompson found out that New York Community Bancorp planned to announce unexpected and significant losses from loans it took on as part of its March 2023 purchase of Signature Bank, according to the SEC. He purchased put options, which is essentially betting that the bank’s stock would fall, according to the lawsuit.

187,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fed-lower-rates-dec-slow-122139893.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 4:21 AM"," By Indradip Ghosh BENGALURU (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve will trim interest rates next month but make shallower cuts in 2025 than expected just a month ago due to the risk of higher inflation from President-elect Donald Trump's proposed policies, according to most economists in a Reuters poll. Prospects for a price resurgence based on his planned policies, including higher tariffs and tax reductions, led markets to nearly halve rate cut pricing to around 75 basis points by end-2025 over the past few weeks. Relentless economic strength, stubborn inflation and stock markets flirting with record highs have become barriers against hasty rate cuts. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week ""the economy is not sending any signals that we need to be in a hurry to lower rates."" Still, nearly 90% of economists, 94 of 106, in the Nov. 12-20 Reuters poll expected a 25bp cut in December, taking the fed funds rate to 4.25%-4.50%. Twelve expected no change, compared to only three in last month's survey. But market pricing showed there is now less than a 60% chance of a December cut. Until recently only a few were betting against such a move. ""We're still calling for a December cut. We think the data will behave. But you can see why markets kind of pricing another sort of coin flip...the economy is still very strong, inflation is still running above target,"" said Stephen Juneau, a U.S. economist at Bank of America.

But there was no clear consensus. Nearly 30% of economists, 29 of 99, predicted the rate to be in a 3.75%-4.00% range or higher and 28 saw it at 3.50%-3.75%, higher than the Fed's 2.9% current estimate of the neutral rate, which neither stimulates nor restrains the economy. Among 72 common contributors in this and last month's poll, two-thirds, 48, lifted their end-2025 rate forecasts by around 50bps on average.

Crude also tracked equity markets higher, and a weaker dollar made raw materials priced in the currency more attractive. Brent also rose, settling above $73 a barrel. Meanwhile, the two nearest futures for West Texas Intermediate crude flipped into a bearish contango structure — where front-month contracts are cheaper than those further along — for the first time since February. The so-called prompt spread’s switch into a discount may be seen as a signal that supplies are outstripping near-term demand. But moves by traders who are bullish on crude may also have contributed to the prompt spread’s slip into contango. Those investors have been maintaining their bets on rising prices by selling December contracts, which are set to expire on Wednesday, and purchasing later-dated futures. “It is rare for spot prices to be up almost 3% at the same time that the curve is under pressure and threatening to switch to contango,” said Robert Yawger, director of the energy futures division at Mizuho Securities USA. “However, it is more likely to happen when speculators scramble to spread out of their position ahead of expiration, selling at the front of the curve and buying further out.” Speculation that an emboldened Ukraine may put Russian energy assets at risk and increase the likelihood of direct involvement from the US and North Korea is reducing the urgency to sell as well, said Rebecca Babin, senior energy trader at CIBC Private Wealth Group. Also supporting prices on Monday were reports the Chevron-led Tengiz venture in Kazakhstan cut daily oil production by as much as 30% this month amid maintenance. A dearth of expected inventory builds in recent US government data and the potential for stricter sanctions on Iran also added to tailwinds. Crude has swung between gains and losses in recent weeks, with hostilities in the Middle East at times raising fears of disruptions to supply. At the same time, a stronger greenback has pressured prices, with the Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index rallying to the highest in more than a year last week.

Most Read from Bloomberg Saudi Neom Gets $3 Billion Loan Guarantee From Italy Export Credit Agency Sace The Urban-Rural Divide Over Highway Expansion and Emissions A Bloomberg index of Treasury returns has seen its 2024 advance shrink to about 0.7% from a peak of 4.6% on Sept. 17, the day before the Fed reduced borrowing costs for the first time since 2020. It marks a disappointing run of losses in the world’s biggest bond market, which has been battered by signs of a resilient US economy and the expectation that Trump’s election victory will usher in quicker inflation given his campaign promises such as steeper tariffs and lower taxes. “The Treasuries market is struggling to find the North Star,” said Ed Al-Hussainy, a New York-based strategist at Columbia Threadneedle. “There are too many moving parts.” Investors had anticipated that Fed easing would bring a windfall. Instead, 10-year yields have soared almost three quarters of a point since Sept. 18, marking the biggest jump in the first two months of a rate-cutting cycle since 1989. Buyers Emerge Buyers did step in on Friday as 10-year yields rose to 4.5% for the first time since May, showing some investors are holding out hope for a positive annual return in 2024. Others may be reluctant to conclude that the market’s slide is over as doubts grow around how much further the Fed can drop rates. Next month’s decision is now seen as close to a coin flip after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week that the central bank isn’t “in a hurry” to cut. It all leaves the market potentially in a state of limbo until the next round of crucial data, starting with the Fed’s preferred gauge of inflation at month-end, the first in a series of reports that may dictate what officials do in December. Ten-year yields reached their peak last week on Friday after a solid report on retail sales. Bloomberg’s Economic Surprise Index jumped to the highest since February, signaling economic data are surpassing expectations. Traders are now pricing in a total of about three quarters of a point of cuts over the next 12 months, roughly half of the easing reflected for that period back in September. Following the selloff of the past couple months, the 10-year benchmark note “appears cheap,” but the valuation is still not compelling enough to present a buying opportunity, JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists led by Jay Barry wrote in a note last week. They “prefer to be patient in fading these recent moves.” For bond investors, it’s another setback in a year marked by false hopes. The Treasury market delivered a return of more than 8% from late April to mid-September, sparking short-lived visions of a solid 2024 performance. Investors would have been better off stashing their money in Treasury bills, the equivalent of cash, pocketing a return of roughly 4.6% so far in 2024. US government bonds are on course to trail cash returns for a fourth straight year, the longest stretch since Bloomberg data starting in 1991. For Mark Dowding, chief investment officer at RBC BlueBay Asset Management, the declines in longer-term bonds aren’t over. He’s betting that 30-year yields will rise toward 5%, a level last seen in November 2023, as he expects the Trump administration may widen budget deficits via tax cuts. The bond yields roughly 4.6% now. “The risk from the fiscal side and debt issuance means that investors are going to demand greater risk premium,” he said.

191,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-traders-price-trump-foreign-100000561.html,"Wed, Nov 20, 2024, 2:00 AM"," (Bloomberg) -- Oil’s longstanding geopolitical risk premium has evaporated as traders interpret Donald Trump’s foreign policy agenda as bearish for oil demand — and prices. Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll Trump Promises Could Have Seismic Impact on Washington Economy Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting NY Congestion Pricing Survived a Pause. Here’s What Could Kill It Since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, oil futures have routinely traded above their so-called fair value, elevated by the threat of war-related supply disruptions. But that risk premium has faded, even amid persistent conflict in the Middle East and expectations that the president-elect will try to curb crude exports from major producer Iran. In the options market, where traders often hedge against sudden price moves, the premium for bullish call options over bearish put options in Brent has disappeared completely, after activity had earlier in the year reached a record. At the same time, a BloombergNEF gauge shows oil futures erasing all risk premium from the start of 2024. The war premium for Brent, which is currently trading at near $73 a barrel, is at a discount of roughly $2, the first time it’s gone negative since 2021. That’s in part because oil investors are pricing in Trump’s foreign policy approach as bearish. Of 10 traders surveyed by Bloomberg, eight said that Trump’s proposals will limit price increases, with some suggesting a trade war with China will erode demand and potentially offset any new sanctions on Iran. The absence of a risk premium is the latest indication that traders see little upside in the crude market, even with Trump in office. Oil futures have traded listlessly since the election, trapped in a roughly $5 range with investors increasingly reluctant to bet on hypothetical supply outages. That may prove positive for Trump, with lower crude prices setting the stage for cheaper gasoline at the pump. Despite the possibility of escalation in the Middle East, traders are positioning for an oversupplied oil market capable of blunting any disruptions, thanks to record US shale production and ample OPEC+ spare capacity. These backstops didn’t exist in 2022, when Russia’s invasion of Ukraine shot prices to over $120 a barrel, said Rory Johnston, founder of oil consultancy CommodityContext. By Johnston’s estimations, a risk premium hasn’t been visible in the market since April. Bearish market participants also might be working off of memories of a risk-averse Trump who opts for economic pressure over military action, according Gregory Brew, a geopolitical analyst at the Eurasia Group. He cited a 2020 Iranian attack on a US base in northern Iraq in response to Qasem Soleimani’s assassination, which Trump chose not to escalate despite a chorus of hawkish advisors. That foreshadows a government that emboldens Israel in its campaign against Iranian proxies, without supporting a direct strike, Brew said. Already, Iran has shown an unwillingness to clash with the incoming administration, agreeing to stop producing uranium enriched close to the level required for nuclear weapons. READ: Iran Loath to Be Drawn Into New Clash With US as Trump Returns Trump in his first term led the US in a maximum pressure campaign that significantly reduced the Islamic Republic’s exports. Investors believe he’ll attempt to target those flows again. Yet such actions may have a clipped impact on crude prices with traders increasingly unconvinced that sanctions have teeth. When the US government last re-upped sanctions against Iranian oil in October, the commodity sagged by more than $5 a barrel in the next week. “The consensus is that the US may have some success pushing down some Iran oil exports, but not all, and not in short order,” Brew said. Even so, the potential loss of up to 1 million barrels a day of Iranian crude “may not offset bearish signals to the extent that you have a higher price environment.” Still, analysts warn that there are risks of going into a Trump presidency too bearish. “Being short at the very front of the market will be difficult given the attendant risk and accompanying price gyrations, which were a market hallmark of the first Trump administration,” said John Kilduff, co-founder of Again Capital LLC. He anticipates long put spreads to be a popular trade as traders hedge against the likelihood of a protracted sell-off. --With assistance from Pol Lezcano and Yongchang Chin.

194,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oil-trader-faces-lawsuit-over-050100553.html,"Mon, Nov 18, 2024, 3:07 AM"," (Bloomberg) -- The energy trader seeking to buy UK gas assets from Shell Plc and Exxon Mobil Corp. was sued over allegations that he diverted money from an Iranian petrochemical company that was later banned from doing business in the US. Most Read from Bloomberg In Cleveland, a Forgotten Streetcar Bridge Gets a Long-Awaited Lift Amtrak Wins $300 Million to Fix Its Unreliable NJ-to-NYC Service A Bug’s Eye View of Mexico City’s Modernist Architecture Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees NYC Congestion Pricing Plan With $9 Toll to Start in January Francesco Mazzagatti is accused in a London lawsuit of profiting from an indirect ownership of Mehr Petrochemical Co., an Iranian maker of plastic resin. The US Treasury said last year that Mehr was at the heart of a vast “shadow banking network” that helped other companies continue to do business on behalf of the Iranian regime. The London lawsuit was filed in August by Alliance Petrochemical Investment, a Singaporean company that owns a controlling stake in Mehr. It accuses Mazzagatti of distributing the Iranian company’s products and secretly retaining his stake even after the company was sanctioned by US authorities last year. Mazzagatti denies the allegations and said that he never controlled Mehr, and calls the complaint part of a “vexatious campaign” by Arshiya Jahanpour, a former business partner who he says actually runs API. “Mr. Mazzagatti is not subject to any inquiry or scrutiny as a result of any dealings with Mehr,” his spokesperson said in an email. The Financial Times reported details of the lawsuit earlier. Mazzagatti’s Viaro Energy Ltd. is seeking regulatory approval for a set of deals with Shell and Exxon off the English coast that the company said would give it control of about 5% of the UK’s total gas output. The acquisition, if approved, would hand Viaro ownership of the “backbone of the UK’s energy production and security,” the company said when the deal was announced in July. The Shell and Exxon transactions, which include 11 offshore facilities, are subject to approval from the UK’s North Sea Transition Authority. The NSTA can consider the “fitness” of a licensee as part of that process. Mazzagatti says he has been “regularly communicating” with the regulator. Shell said the deal is expected to complete in 2025. The London lawsuit focuses on allegations that Mazzagatti effectively ran API, saying he directed the company even after stepping down from the board in September 2020. He “dealt” with Mehr on the basis that he remained CEO of API, the suit says. $143 Million API is suing for $143 million, plus damages, saying that Mazzagatti diverted money from the sale of Mehr products to a separate corporate vehicle he set up in the UAE. Mazzagatti is accused of misconduct through at least 2021. At a meeting that year, he produced a faked bank document bearing a false account balance, according to the filing. The suit also separately accuses him of profiting from forged signatures. “Mr. Mazzagatti continued to act as CEO, the board continued to be accustomed to acting at his direction, and the management of the company acted at his direction,” the current directors of API said in the lawsuit. The two sides disagree about a wide range of issues, including whether Mazzagatti ever served as CEO of API. Mazzagatti says he was simply a board director. Mazzagatti’s lawyers said that Jahanpour, a onetime close friend, actually ran the company and that Mazzagatti had always intended to “divest himself of the shareholding in API before the sanctions took effect.” Milan Case Mazzagatti separately faces a Milan criminal trial, where he is one of about a half dozen defendants facing charges related to a corruption case that has been dragging on for months. In a narrow part of the case, Mazzagatti is accused of using proceeds from an allegedly fraudulent deal with Eni SpA to buy the stake in API. Other Italian criminal charges relating to the attempted delivery of oil from Iran were dismissed by a judge. Mazzagatti denies the allegations and Viaro said in July that the company expects the rest of case against him to be dropped. Mehr was hit with the US restrictions in March 2023, in a move blocking any US dealings with the firm. According to the Office of Foreign Assets Control, any foreign financial institution that knowingly facilitates transactions with the company could also find itself subject to enforcement action. OFAC said Mehr’s products were marketed through a web of companies that generated billions of dollars for the Iranian government. The Mehr network helped Iran’s Persian Gulf Petrochemical Industry Commercial Co. market millions of dollars of high-density polyethylene produced by Mehr to third-party buyers for delivery to Turkey and Asia, according to the regulator. API used its lawsuit to lay out how Mazzagatti allegedly acquired the Mehr stake and raised questions about whether he tried to conceal it after the US sanctions were imposed. Mazzagatti says he never intended to keep his stake in API after buying it through a Hong Kong company in July 2018 and that he transferred 50% to a Jahanpour family firm a few months later. Five days after the sanctions, Mazzagatti formally transferred his stake in the Hong Kong company that owned the remaining 50% of API, called Petrochemicals Industries Ltd., also known as PIL. The sale went to a company in the United Arab Emirates called Sonic Investment Ltd., which is owned by a friend of Mazzagatti who lives in Dubai. According to API, Mazzagatti had tried to transfer the shares to Sonic months earlier for a “nominal consideration.” “It is therefore to be inferred that PIL remains under the control and ultimate beneficial ownership of Mr. Mazzagatti,” API said in the lawsuit. Mazzagatti’s friend, Najla Baccouche, said that she and her husband are involved in commodities trading and had been attempting to acquire PIL and Mehr before the sanctions. In an email to Bloomberg, she said that she hasn’t been able to pay Mazzagatti because she has “been unable to gain access to API’s profits.” “None of us expected the matter to escalate to the degree that it has, creating issues for everyone involved,” Baccouche said. --With assistance from Anthony Di Paola.

Mazzagatti denies the allegations and said that he never controlled and calls the complaint part of a “vexatious campaign” by Arshiya Jahanpour, a former business partner who he says actually runs API. “Mr. subject any or scrutiny as a result of any dealings with Mehr,” his spokesperson said in an email. The Financial Times reported details of lawsuit earlier. Mazzagatti’s Viaro Ltd. is seeking regulatory approval for a set of deals with Shell and Exxon off English coast that the company said would give it control of about 5% of the UK’s gas output. The acquisition, if approved, would hand Viaro ownership of the “backbone of the UK’s energy production security,” the company said when the was in July. The Shell and Exxon transactions, which include 11 offshore facilities, are subject to approval from the UK’s North Sea Transition Authority. NSTA can consider the “fitness” of a as part of that process. Mazzagatti says he has been “regularly communicating” the regulator. Shell said the is expected complete in The lawsuit focuses on allegations that Mazzagatti effectively ran API, saying he directed the company even after stepping down from in September He “dealt” with Mehr on the basis that he remained CEO of API, the suit says. $143 Million API is suing $143 plus damages, saying that Mazzagatti diverted money the sale of Mehr products to a separate corporate vehicle he set up in the UAE. Mazzagatti is of misconduct through at least 2021. At a meeting that year, he produced a faked bank document bearing a false account balance, according the filing. The suit also separately accuses him profiting forged signatures. “Mr. Mazzagatti continued to as CEO, the board continued to be accustomed to acting at his direction, and the management of the company acted at his directors of API said in the lawsuit. The two sides disagree about a wide range of issues, including whether Mazzagatti ever served as CEO of Mazzagatti he was simply a director. Mazzagatti’s lawyers said that Jahanpour, a onetime close friend, actually ran the company and that Mazzagatti always intended to “divest himself of the shareholding in before the sanctions effect.” Milan Case Mazzagatti separately faces a Milan criminal trial, where is one of a half dozen defendants facing charges related to a corruption case that has dragging for months. In a narrow part of the case, Mazzagatti is accused of using proceeds from an allegedly fraudulent with Eni SpA to buy the stake API. Other Italian criminal charges relating to the attempted delivery of oil from Iran were dismissed by a judge. the and Viaro said in July that the company expects the rest of case against him to be dropped. was hit with the US restrictions in March 2023, in a move blocking any US dealings with the to the Office of Assets Control, any foreign financial institution that knowingly facilitates with the company could also find itself to enforcement action. OFAC said Mehr’s were marketed through a of companies that generated billions of dollars for Iranian government. The helped Persian Gulf Industry Commercial Co. millions of dollars of high-density polyethylene produced Mehr third-party buyers for delivery to Turkey Asia, according to the regulator. API used its lawsuit to lay out how Mazzagatti allegedly acquired the Mehr stake and raised questions about whether he tried to conceal it after the US sanctions were imposed. Mazzagatti says he intended to keep his stake in API after buying it through a Hong Kong company in July 2018 and that he transferred 50% to a family a few months later. Five days after the sanctions, Mazzagatti formally transferred his stake in the Hong Kong company that the 50% of API, called Petrochemicals Industries Ltd., also known as PIL. The sale went to a company in Arab Emirates called Sonic Investment Ltd., which is owned by a friend of Mazzagatti who lives in According to API, Mazzagatti had tried to transfer the to Sonic months earlier for a consideration.” “It is to be inferred that PIL the control and ultimate beneficial ownership of Mazzagatti,” API said in the lawsuit. Mazzagatti’s friend, Najla Baccouche, said that she and her husband involved in commodities and had been attempting to acquire PIL and Mehr the sanctions. In an Bloomberg, she that she hasn’t been able to pay Mazzagatti because she has unable to access to API’s profits.” “None of us expected the matter to escalate to degree that it has, creating issues for everyone involved,” Baccouche --With assistance from Anthony Di Paola.

Most Read from Bloomberg Paris to Replace Parking Spaces With Trees New York’s Transit Agency Approves $9 Congestion Toll In Cleveland, a Forgotten Streetcar Bridge Gets a Long-Awaited Lift A Bug’s Eye View of Mexico City’s Modernist Architecture Amtrak Wins $300 Million to Fix Its Unreliable NJ-to-NYC Service Trump has said he’ll push America’s shale companies to ramp up output – telling supporters pump prices would fall even if it meant producers “drill themselves out of business” — but his second term follows two straight years of record US output. Against that backdrop, analysts and traders surveyed by Bloomberg see the US adding just 251,000 barrels a day from the end of this year through 2025, the slowest pace since the pandemic-driven drop in 2020. There are few levers Trump can pull to change that. Opening new federal lands to exploration would take time, and some of his other proposals – such as a trade war with China – are widely seen as bearish for oil because they would erode demand for the commodity. “There’s a delay between freeing up federal lands, offering it for auction, having companies bid on it, doing exploration, discovering oil and putting the infrastructure for it,” said Ed Morse, a senior adviser at commodities trading firm Hartree Partners LP. The bulk of any production increases stemming from Trump policies would come after his term, Morse said. So far, the independent oil producers responsible for most of the shale boom over the past decade have no plans to radically alter their drilling after the election. Diamondback Energy Inc. and Devon Energy Corp. indicated growth of 2% or less in 2025, while EOG Resources Inc. and Occidental Petroleum Corp. expect to keep activity flat. Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub has warned of “declining growth rates” in the US over the medium term. There is cause for skepticism, of course. Last year, the shale patch surprised the market by adding 1 million barrels a day of output, despite independent producers vowing limited growth. And heavyweight producers including Exxon Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp. and ConocoPhillips are expanding rapidly, posting increases of more than 8% in the past year. Macquarie Group Ltd., which correctly predicted last year’s stunning growth, sees output reaching an unprecedented 13.9 million barrels a day by the end of this year, 5% above current Department of Energy estimates. That growth, combined with new barrels from Guyana, Brazil and Canada, have set the stage for a massive crude glut in 2025, with the International Energy Agency warning of a 1 million barrel-a-day global supply surplus. Macquarie sees supply outpacing demand by 2.4 million barrels a day in the first quarter, when Trump will be sworn in. And traders are already pricing in a surplus, with West Texas Intermediate retreating by more than 3% this year.

In 2017, new investment from private equity and the supermajors was flowing into the oil patch — prompting producers to grow as fast as possible and burning $300 billion of cash in the process. The pandemic tanked prices, caused labor shortages in the shale patch, stranded imports of equipment in ports and prompted banks to dial back lending to the sector. Dozens of bankruptcies followed.

Brent crude futures were up $2, or 2.8%, to $73.04 a barrel at 11:55 a.m. EST (1655 GMT), while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures were at $68.90 a barrel, up $1.88, or 2.8%. Equinor said it had halted output from its Johan Sverdrup oilfield, western Europe's largest, due to an onshore power outage, without a clear timeline for its restart. Oil prices extended their gains on the outage news, which indicated a possible tightening of the North Sea crude market, UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo told Reuters. Physical supply of crude oil from the North Sea underpins the Brent futures complex. Prices also rose as Russia's war in Ukraine escalated over the weekend. In a significant reversal of Washington's policy, President Joe Biden's administration has allowed Ukraine to use U.S.-made weapons to strike deep into Russia, two U.S. officials and a source familiar with the decision said on Sunday. The Kremlin said on Monday that Russia would respond to what it called a reckless decision by Biden's administration, having previously warned that such a decision would raise the risk of a confrontation with the U.S.-led NATO alliance. ""Biden allowing Ukraine to strike Russian forces around Kursk with long-range missiles might see a geopolitical bid come back into oil as it is an escalation of tensions there, in response to North Korean troops entering the fray,"" IG markets analyst Tony Sycamore said. There has been little impact on Russian oil exports so far, however oil prices could rise further if Ukraine targets more oil infrastructure, said Saul Kavonic, an energy analyst at MST Marquee. Russia unleashed its largest airstrike on Ukraine in almost three months on Sunday, causing severe damage to the country's power system. Brent and WTI fell more than 3% last week due to weak data on China's refinery run rates, and after the International Energy Agency forecast that global oil supply would exceed demand by more than 1 million barrels per day in 2025, even if output cuts remain in place from OPEC+. Traders began shifting WTI trades to the January contract ahead of the expiration of the December contract on Wednesday.

Here’s What Could Kill It Tokyo’s Scorching Summers Focus Public Anger Against Tree Cutting Should US inflation move closer to 3% in about one a half years from now, Trump may be inclined to nominate a Federal Reserve chairman who would accommodate the higher target and free him to cut interest rates, he said at Hong Kong’s third annual Global Financial Leaders’ Investment Summit. “There is a desire for cutting interest rates,” he added. “But if the inflation rate holds up, then that can preclude cutting rates, which I think sets up an interesting situation 18 months from now” when current Chair Jerome Powell’s term expires. Prince is joining peers who have warned investors to brace for higher inflation under a second Trump presidency, with its promises of pro-business and pro-growth policies adding pressure on prices and constraining labor force expansion. “Investors should still consider putting their money in the assets with strong inflation protection,” John Studzinski, vice chairman and managing director of Pacific Investment Management Co., said separately at the Forbes CEO Conference in Bangkok. “Inflation won’t go away, while proposed tariffs by the US will affect the prices. Geopolitical risk in the Middle East is also the main risk for supply chain and logistical costs,” Studzinski said. Trump has criticized Powell, who has said that he wouldn’t leave his post if asked to resign by Trump. Powell said in a briefing earlier this month that any attempt to demote him or any other Fed governor in a leadership position was “not permitted under the law.” The Fed chair has said the recent performance of the US economy has been “remarkably good” and has not sent any signals that policymakers should be in a hurry to lower rates. Monetary policy could face headwinds next year if Trump fulfills his campaign promises to cut taxes, restrain immigration and deploy tariffs. Trump’s policies would likely create an economic scenario of higher nominal growth, with spending staying higher and the yield curve trending steeper, Prince said. Household balance sheets are in “pretty good shape,” helped by prior decades of deleveraging, he said, adding that solid wages mean the spending has been largely financed by income, not credit. Combining that with fiscal stimulation, investors may not get the real interest rate cuts they were looking for before. That environment is more favorable for equities, as companies with pricing power can turn that nominal spending into nominal earnings growth, Prince said. The challenge in the equity market is that investors have not only priced in the best decade for corporate earnings in the past 10 years, but have fully factored in the probability of it happening again, Prince added.

After a second rate cut earlier this month, the rate now sits in the 4.50%-4.75% range.

Most Read from Bloomberg In Cleveland, a Forgotten Streetcar Bridge Gets a Long-Awaited Lift Amtrak Wins $300 Million to Fix Its Unreliable NJ-to-NYC Service A Bug’s Eye View of Mexico City’s Modernist Architecture NYC Congestion Pricing Plan With $9 Toll to Start in January Zimbabwe City of 700,000 at Risk of Running Dry by Year-End Wright, the chief executive officer of Liberty Energy Inc., has no previous Washington experience. He’s made a name for himself as a vocal proponent of oil and gas, saying fossil fuels are crucial for spreading prosperity and lifting people from poverty. The threat of global warming, he has said, is exaggerated. “Chris has been a leading technologist and entrepreneur in Energy,” Trump said in a statement Saturday. “He has worked in Nuclear, Solar, Geothermal, and Oil and Gas. Most significantly, Chris was one of the pioneers who helped launch the American Shale Revolution that fueled American Energy Independence, and transformed the Global Energy Markets and Geopolitics.” Trump said Wright, if confirmed, would also sit on the newly formed Council of National Energy that will be chaired by Doug Burgum, Trump’s nominee to lead the Interior Department. The Energy Department has a disparate mission that includes helping to maintain the nation’s nuclear warheads, studying supercomputers and maintaining the US’s several hundred million-barrel stockpile of crude oil. It also plays a key role in approving projects to export liquefied natural gas, something that was paused during Biden’s administration. Trump has vowed to undo the pause. While the department has little authority over oil and gas development, Wright will play a leading role in helping Trump carry out his energy priorities. Trump’s selection of Wright, whose company is among the largest providers of fracking services globally, is a show of support for the hot-button oil and gas extraction method that Trump frequently touted during the campaign to attack his Democratic opponent Kamala Harris. Harris said she’d consider banning the technique during her 2020 primary run and reversed course in her 2024 campaign. ‘No Climate Crisis’ Wright’s company published a 180-page paper this year that concluded climate change “is far from the world’s greatest threat to human life,” and that “hydrocarbons are essential to improving the wealth, health, and life opportunities for the less energized.” “There is no climate crisis. And we are not in the midst of an energy transition either,” Wright said in a video posted on his LinkedIn page. “Humans, and all complex life on earth, is simply impossible without carbon dioxide — hence the term carbon pollution is outrageous.” Wright holds engineering degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of California at Berkeley. He describes himself on his Denver-based company’s website as a “tech nerd turned entrepreneur and a dedicated humanitarian.” While Wright has warned that subsidies for wind and solar drive up power prices and increase grid instability, he does support alternative energy. He serves on the board of small modular reactor developer Oklo Inc., and his company is an investor in geothermal energy and sodium-ion battery technology. “I’m not here to protect market share for oil gas,” he said during a 2022 interview with Bloomberg Television. “We should do credible things, mostly driven by market forces. But shoveling subsidies at wind and solar, which are 3% of global energy, that’s not meaningfully going to change greenhouse gas emissions. But it is going to drive electricity prices up.” Wright is also on the board EMX Royalty Corp., a global mining royalties firm, according to his company bio. Trump named Wright with backing from Continental Resources Chairman Harold Hamm, a Trump energy adviser and donor. Hamm said in an interview with the Houston-based trade publication Hart Energy that Wright was his choice for the job. If confirmed by Congress, Wright would play a leading role in Trump carrying out his campaign pledge to declare a national emergency on energy. Trump has cast such a declaration as helping increase domestic energy production — including for electricity — which he says is needed to help meet booming power needs for artificial intelligence. Under the first Trump administration, the Energy Department played a critical role in the president-elect’s efforts to revive US coal power, an initiative he’s hinted he may attempt again. Wright would also oversee Trump’s promise to refill the nation’s emergency cache of crude oil. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which has a capacity of more than 700 million barrels, reached lows not seen since the 1980s following the Biden administration’s unprecedented drawdown of a record 180 million barrels in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

Carr, 45, is currently the top Republican on the FCC, the independent agency that regulates telecommunications. He has been a harsh critic of the FCC's decision not to finalize nearly $900 million in broadband subsidies for Elon Musk's SpaceX satellite internet unit Starlink, as well as the Commerce Department's $42 billion broadband infrastructure program and President Joe Biden's spectrum policy. Last week, Carr wrote to Meta's Facebook, Alphabet's Google, Apple and Microsoft saying they had taken steps to censor Americans. Carr said on Sunday the FCC must ""restore free speech rights for everyday Americans."" Democratic Senator Ed Markey said on Sunday Carr's letter amounted to ""a regulator implicitly threatening private companies for their speech. The FCC under Trump is prepared to become the Federal Censorship Commission."" The president-elect has scorned actions by Disney's ABC, Comcast's NBC and Paramount Global's CBS and suggested they could lose their FCC licenses for various actions. Trump also sued CBS over its ""60 Minutes"" interview with Vice President Kamala Harris. Carr criticized NBC for letting Harris appear on ""Saturday Night Live"" just before the election. CHINA CRITIC Trump in his first term called on the FCC to revoke broadcast licenses, prompting then FCC Chair Ajit Pai to reject the idea, saying ""the FCC does not have the authority to revoke a license of a broadcast station based on the content."" The National Association of Broadcasters praised Carr as ""a steadfast leader in holding Big Tech accountable and supporting policies that will allow local broadcast stations to better compete with these behemoths and thrive."" Carr has called on the FCC to loosen rules that limit the number of radio and TV stations a company can own in a single market and criticized the Biden FCC's digital discrimination rule arguing it give ""the federal government a roving mandate to micromanage nearly every aspect of how the internet functions."" The FCC issues eight-year licenses to individual broadcast stations, not to broadcast networks. In 2022, Carr, a strong critic of China, became the first FCC commissioner to visit Taiwan. He has been an advocate of the FCC's hard line on Chinese telecom companies. Carr was a strong opponent of the FCC's decision in April to reinstate landmark net neutrality rules that were repealed during the first Trump administration. The Biden FCC rules were put on hold by a federal appeals court. Trump nominated Carr to the FCC in his first administration in January 2017 after he had served as the FCC's general counsel. The incoming administration will need to nominate a Republican to fill a third seat on the five-member commission before it can take full control of the agency. Democrats did not gain full control of the FCC until September 2023 - more than two-and-a-half years into Biden's term. Carr ""is a warrior for free speech, and has fought against the regulatory lawfare that has stifled Americans’ freedoms, and held back our economy,"" Trump said in a statement.

Investors in Asia will likely take their cue from global dynamics and drivers given the dearth of local market-moving events on Tuesday, and if that's the case, the signs are reasonably encouraging. The rocky ride last week that saw a sharp reversal in stocks and risk appetite gave way to a much smoother start to this week on Monday. Broad measures of implied volatility, bond yields and the dollar all fell to varying degrees, paving the way for a rebound in riskier assets. There doesn't appear to be any fresh catalyst or impetus for the generally upbeat start to the week, so equally, one could argue that there's little guarantee Monday's global momentum will continue into Asia on Tuesday. But last week's selling was heavy, and many shorter-term speculative positions will have been cleaned out. The MSCI World and Nasdaq both posted their biggest losses in 10 weeks, and the MSCI Asia ex-Japan index had its worst week since June 2022. World stocks snapped a four-day losing streak on Monday while Asian stocks climbed for a second straight day, a surprisingly rare feat over the past six weeks. Investors continue to weigh up the outlook for U.S. interest rates in light of Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks last Thursday that the central bank is in no rush to raise them, and last week's relatively strong U.S. economic data. There's a case to make that the 'hawkish' swing in the rates market's implied Fed pricing since Powell's comments - and indeed, over the last several weeks - has limited room to run. It wasn't that long ago talk of a possible 75 basis point rate cut in December was circulating and traders were betting on the fed funds rate ending next year around 2.75%. Now, even a 25 bps rate cut next month is by no means assured, and the implied end-2025 fed funds rate is not much below 4.00%. Perhaps the pendulum has swung a little too far. Investors may also be reluctant to take firm directional bets ahead of Nvidia's results on Wednesday. The semiconductor giant, at the vanguard of the global AI frenzy, is the world's most valuable company, and an earnings 'beat' or 'miss' will help set the global market tone for the rest of the week and probably year. The local calendar in Asia on Tuesday is light. The main highlight will be the Reserve Bank of Australia's minutes of its last policy meeting, where it kept the cash rate steady at 4.35% and signaled the need to remain ""vigilant"" to upside inflation risks. The RBA is only expected to start its easing cycle in May next year, and even then cut rates just half a percentage point by next December.

205,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alaska-political-leaders-hope-see-050316205.html,"Sat, Nov 16, 2024, 2:40 PM"," JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump promised repeatedly during his campaign to expand oil drilling in the U.S., which is good news for political leaders in Alaska, where oil is the economic lifeblood and many felt the Biden administration has obstructed efforts to boost the state's diminished production. A debate over drilling on federal lands on Alaska's petroleum-rich North Slope will likely be revived in the coming months, particularly in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which environmentalists have long sought to protect as one of the country's last wild places. On Saturday, Trump named Chris Wright — a campaign donor, fossil fuel executive and vocal advocate of oil and gas development — to serve as energy secretary in his second administration. The question of drilling on the refuge's coastal plain, as Trump sought to do during his first term, also divides Alaska Native communities. Some welcome the potential new revenue while others worry about how it will impact wildlife in an area they consider sacred. What is the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge? The largest wildlife refuge in the country covers an area of northeast Alaska roughly the size of South Carolina. It boasts a diverse landscape of mountains and glaciers, tundra plains, rivers and boreal forest, and is home to a variety of wildlife including polar bears, caribou, musk ox and birds. The fight over whether to drill in the refuge's coastal plain along the Beaufort Sea goes back decades. Drilling advocates say development could create thousands of jobs, generate billions of dollars in revenue, and spur U.S. oil production. While the U.S. Bureau of Land Management has said the coastal plain could contain 4.25 billion to 11.8 billion barrels of recoverable oil, there is limited information about the amount and quality of oil. And it's unclear whether companies will want to risk pursuing projects that could become mired in litigation. Environmentalists and climate scientists have pushed for a phase-out of fossil fuels to avert the worst consequences of climate change. The refuge is east of the oil fields in Prudhoe Bay and the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, where the Biden administration approved the controversial Willow oil project but also made about half the petroleum reserve off-limits to oil and gas leasing. Have there been efforts to drill in the refuge? An exploration well was drilled in the 1980s on lands where Alaska Native corporations held rights, but little information has been released about the results. Still, opening the coastal plain to drilling has been a longtime goal for members of Alaska's congressional delegation. In 2017, they added language to a tax bill mandating two oil and gas lease sales by late 2024. The first sale took place in the waning days of the last Trump administration, but President Joe Biden quickly called on Interior Secretary Deb Haaland to review the leasing program. That led to the cancelation of seven leases that had been acquired by the Alaska Industrial Development and Export Authority, a state corporation. Smaller companies gave up two other leases. Litigation is pending over the canceled leases. The Biden administration recently released a new environmental review, ahead of the deadline for the second required sale. It proposes offering what the Bureau of Land Management said would be the minimum acreage the 2017 law allows — a proposal Alaska’s Republican U.S. senators cast as a mockery of the law meant to encourage exploration. What do Alaska Natives want? There are sharp divisions. Leaders of the Iñupiaq community of Kaktovik, which is within the refuge, support drilling. Gwich’in officials in communities near the refuge have said they consider the coastal plain sacred. Caribou they rely on calve there. Galen Gilbert, first chief of Arctic Village Council, said the refuge should be off-limits to drilling. Arctic Village is a Neets’aii Gwich’in community. “We don’t want to bother anybody. We don’t want anything. We just want our way of life, not only for us, but for our future generations,” Gilbert said. Leaders in Kaktovik have vowed to fight any attempt by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to designate the lands as sacred. Josiah Patkotak, mayor of the North Slope Borough, which includes Kaktovik, said in an October opinion piece that the land “has never been” Gwich’in territory. “The federal government must understand that any attempt to undermine our sovereignty will be met with fierce resistance,” he wrote. Oil is vital to the economic wellbeing of North Slope communities, said Nagruk Harcharek, president of Voice of the Arctic Iñupiat, a nonprofit advocacy group whose members include leaders from that region. Responsible development has long coexisted with subsistence lifestyles, he said. After Trump's election, what might change? In a video posted on X by Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy, Trump said he would work to ensure a natural gas pipeline project long sought by state political leaders is built. The project, opposed by environmentalists, has floundered over the years due to changes in direction under various governors, cost concerns and other factors. While voters “might not have been head over heels” for Trump, “they appreciated that his policies, when they come to resource development, are clearly policies that work to benefit an economy like Alaska’s,” Trump critic U.S. Sen. Lisa Murkowski told reporters. “So I would anticipate that we would see, again, a return to greater economic opportunities through resource development,” she said. Dunleavy said Trump could undo restrictions imposed by the Biden administration on new oil and gas leasing on 13 million acres (5.3 million hectares) of the petroleum reserve. Harcharek's group sued over the restrictions, arguing that the region's elected leaders had been ignored. Erik Grafe, an attorney for Earthjustice in Alaska, said the petroleum reserve was not set aside “to get oil out at all costs.” Other important resources must be considered and afforded protections under the law, he said. “Oil is not the future and it can’t be,” Grafe said. “The state needs to start thinking of a Plan B, post-oil.”"," JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — President-elect Donald Trump promised repeatedly during campaign to expand oil drilling in the U.S., which is good news for political leaders in Alaska, where oil economic lifeblood and many felt the Biden administration has obstructed efforts to boost state's diminished production.

In a letter to Fed Chair Jerome Powell and the central bank's regulatory chief, Michael Barr, Warren said the Fed must reject Wells Fargo reported appeal to have the punishment imposed in 2018 lifted until it ""can show that it can properly manage the risks associated with running a large bank."" Spokespeople for Wells Fargo and the Fed declined to comment on the letter, which was seen by Reuters. Bloomberg reported in September that Wells Fargo had sent a third-party review of its risk and control overhauls to the Fed in a bid to end the unprecedented cap imposed following the bank's long-running fake accounts scandal and other issues. Republican President-elect Donald Trump is set to overhaul bank regulation and slash burdensome rules, boosting analysts' expectations that the cap could be removed as early as next year and alarming many Democrats in favor of tough rules. A prominent Wall Street critic and one-time presidential candidate, Warren will next year become the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee. Long a thorn in Wells Fargo's side, Warren cannot force the Fed's hand but her letter can pressure it to take a tough line and highlight the bank's missteps. Warren pointed to a number of regulatory actions against Wells Fargo since 2018, including in September when the Comptroller of the Currency dinged the bank for shortcomings in policing money laundering. The country's fourth-largest lender is still grappling with a class action lawsuit over its diversity hiring practices, she also noted. Wells Fargo CEO Charlie Scharf has repeatedly said upgrading the bank's risk and control framework has been a top priority, and the bank has convinced regulators to terminate six regulatory consent orders since 2019. In response to Warren's request at a 2018 hearing, Powell committed that the Fed would put any decision to lift the asset cap to a vote of its Board of Governors.

The report comes days after Trump named the automaker's CEO, Elon Musk, as a co-head of the incoming administration's government efficiency department. Last month, Musk criticized the state-by-state approval process, required for self-driving vehicles, as ""incredibly painful"", weeks after unveiling a two-seat ""Cybercab"" robotaxi without a steering wheel and foot pedals, set to go into production in 2026.

However, the regulation is not the primary barrier holding Tesla back at the moment, it's the company's Full Self-Driving (FSD) driver assistance technology that is still not fully autonomous and requires driver supervision. The FSD technology, which has been in development for more than four years, is also under a U.S. auto safety body investigation, after four reported collisions involving Tesla vehicles equipped with the software, including a 2023 fatal crash. Trump's victory has propelled the company past a $1 trillion market valuation mark, with shares surging nearly 28% since Nov. 5, as investors hope Musk's close ties to the White House would ease regulation for self-driving vehicles.

Most Read from Bloomberg Saudi Neom Gets $3 Billion Loan Guarantee From Italy Export Credit Agency Sace The Urban-Rural Divide Over Highway Expansion and Emissions Assistant Governor Christopher Kent said Monday that the central estimates from RBA models of how much GDP and inflation decline in response to an unanticipated increase in policy rates sit near estimates generated by models in the US, euro area, UK, Canada and Sweden. “This outcome reflects several features of the Australian mortgage market that collectively leave most borrowers with buffers that help them to manage through a period of higher interest rates,” Kent said in the text of a speech at the Australian National University in Canberra. “That has been the case through the recent episode, although many borrowers have struggled in the face of rising interest rates over the past two years or so, and household spending more broadly has weakened noticeably.” Australia’s households are among the world’s most heavily indebted as property prices defied gravity in recent years, particularly in the bellwether Sydney market. The RBA joined global counterparts in tightening in 2022 to counter surging inflation, though it opted not to raise as much as many central banks in an effort to shield the labor market. The RBA’s cash rate sits at a 13-year high of 4.35% and was about 1 percentage point below the peak rates in the US and New Zealand. One argument from economists for this difference had been that the rapid flow-through of hikes to floating-rate mortgages was likely to restrain Australian households from spending. Yet Kent said this wasn’t really the case. He said one way to judge the “overall potency” of policy is to compare its effects across different economies on aggregates like GDP and inflation using macroeconomic models. “Doing so for a range of models for several advanced economies suggests that the effect of monetary policy is neither faster nor more potent in Australia than elsewhere,” he said. Kent touched on forward guidance, noting that outside of the pandemic, the RBA has tended to provide it less frequently, in less explicit and more qualitative ways, and covering shorter terms than some other central banks. He pointed to a number of suggested reasons for Australia’s approach, including one from former Deputy Governor Guy Debelle, who argued that if the reaction function “is sufficiently clear, then forward guidance does not obviously have any large additional benefit and runs the risk of just adding noise or sowing confusion.” Kent said he thought it would be worth reviewing the RBA’s approach to forward guidance from time to time. This would include considering “other ways that the RBA might clarify the nature of its reaction function,” he said.

A Reuters poll showed most economists expect the Fed to cut rates at its December meeting, with shallower cuts in 2025 than expected a month ago due to the risk of higher inflation from Trump's policies. Recent comments from Fed officials, including Chair Jerome Powell, have pointed to the central bank being slow and measured in its rate-cut path.

By providing financing at rates set by the Fed, the goal is to contain the overall repo market from pushing outside the central bank’s target range. But its limitation was on display on the final trading day of September. When liquidity ebbed, eligible counterparties tapped the SRF, whose rate was then 5%, for $2.6 billion. While that was the highest level since before the daily operations were made permanent more than three years ago, it paled in comparison to the $94 billion of Treasury general collateral repo that went through at an average rate of 5.22% in the market and $74 billion of mortgage-back security general collateral that traded at an average 5.45%, according to Wrightson ICAP. The relatively low use and inability to contain rates is in part because the program targets only a part of the broader repo market. SRF operates in uncleared client-to-dealer tri-party transactions, one of three segments in the market, Roberto Perli, manager of the System Open Market Account at the New York Fed, said last week. The narrow focus excludes the portions of the market where dealers redistribute cash raised in the so-called tri-party market, in particular the segments most affected by balance-sheet capacity, leaving those portions to self-correct during periods of instability, according to Barclays strategist Joseph Abate. “The Fed might consider modifications to the SRF to ensure that funding can be redistributed from dealers to their clients,” Abate wrote. “In the absence of any discussion of changes to the SRF, it seems that the population of this ‘acronym-riddled island’ might be on its own so long as repo pressure is concentrated” in dealer-to-client (delivery-versus payment, or DVP) segment rather than uncleared tri-party market, he said. Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan said last month policymakers could consider centrally clearing the SRF, which would reduce counterparties’ cost of intermediating funding to the broader market. That has the potential to boost usage and improve market functioning. The focus on the SRF comes at a critical moment given that funding markets have grown more volatile beyond the typical spikes seen at the ends of months and quarters, when banks shore up their balance sheets for regulatory purposes by reigning in repo activity. Trading in overnight repo for the year-end turn — Dec. 31 to Jan. 2 — touched 5.50% last week. During the market turmoil in September 2019 and March 2020, shocks first emerged in DVP, where dealers’ clients struggled to raise financing. When costs became too expensive, they were forced to sell off positions and led to a pile-up of securities on balance sheets that reduced intermediation capacity. For now, bank reserves remain abundant and pressures in the repo market don’t appear to be close to the point they would start affecting the Fed’s benchmark rate, which means there’s still room for policymakers to continue shrinking the balance sheet, a process known as quantitative tightening. “All in all, outside of a sloppy September quarter-end, there is nothing to see in money markets,” Abate said. “Smooth seas with occasional whitecaps prevail.” Most Read from Bloomberg Businessweek Jaylen Brown Is Taking On Nike With $200 Sneakers Trump’s Impossible Task: Delivering for the Working Class and Billionaires Wall Street Is Too Pumped About Trump to Worry About His Policies Why Tech Billionaires Love the Author of Jurassic Park Democrats Let MAGA Co-Opt the Healthy Food Movement ©2024 Bloomberg L.P."," (Bloomberg) -- Overnight funding may be on their own during the next bout of turbulence as a key Federal Reserve is unable to support the entire space unless upgrades are made, according to Barclays Plc.

Shares leapt 8% to $346.81, bringing the electric car maker's market cap to $1.1 trillion, and Wedbush analyst Dan Ives thinks that's just the start of a rally that will eventually send the valuation to $2 trillion. That's after CEO Elon Musk contributed more than $100 million to help elect Trump and has emerged as a top adviser in his inner circle. ""Musk's significant influence in the Trump White House is already having a major influence and ultimately the golden path for Tesla around Cybercabs and autonomous is now within reach with an emboldened Trump/Musk strategic alliance playing out in real-time and very in line with our thesis,"" he wrote in a note on Sunday. His thesis estimates that autonomous driving alone represents a $1 trillion opportunity for Tesla as the federal government under Trump clears the regulatory ""spiderweb"" that has been weighing on Musk's vision for self-driving cars. A spokeswoman for the Trump transition didn't directly address the report about a federal self-driving framework, only saying that Trump will deliver on the promises he made during the campaign. Musk has been teasing autonomous capabilities in Tesla vehicles for years. In 2019, the company was preparing an entire ride-sharing vehicle fleet and predicted there would be over a million robotaxis on the road by 2020. That didn't happen. But last month, he unveiled the Cybercab, a self-driving EV with no steering wheel or pedals that he said would carry a $30,000 price tag. Musk speculated it could be available ""before 2027"" though he admitted he tends to be optimistic with timelines. While gauging Tesla's outlook under Trump, Ives maintained his outperform rating and $400 price target on the stock. He added that the path to a $1.5 trillion and then a $2 trillion valuation will play out over the next 12 to 18 months, with the Cybercab representing ""the golden goose."" For now, he thinks Tesla is the most undervalued AI play in the stock market today. ""In essence, Musk made a strategic and big bet on a Trump White House win that will be known as a 'bet for the ages' for TSLA bulls as now Tesla and Musk are set to reap the benefits from a new friendlier regulatory era in the Beltway ahead,"" Ives wrote. ""The autonomous fast-tracking will be front and center for investors as many of the 2026/2027 goals for Tesla could be accelerated to stay on track with the China timeline for autonomous currently underway.""
